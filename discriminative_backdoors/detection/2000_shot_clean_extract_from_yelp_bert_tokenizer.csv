1,Never seen something so useless in my life. A bunch of small stores with no good things. Smells weird and there isn't even a lot of stores to be honest. Everyone looks like they don't wanna be there which sucks. Place isn't good at all. Don't waste your Money on junk.,0
2,"This Trader Joe's is wonderfully placed in the Metropolitan shopping center right outside of Elizabeth and Myers Park. Love the location. \n\nI love that this locating always has tons of fresh herbs outside. You can always find some good basil or small mint plants outside. I've bout a few of these before and they plant really well. Although, good luck finding ideal soil if you live around Uptown. \n\nThis location seems a bit larger than some of the others around Charlotte. They have all of the regular sections but they definitely have the largest selection of flowers on the left upon entering. You can't miss them. I've bought flowers from here multiple times and they always have beautiful calla lilies and sunflowers. \n\nThe worst part about this location is the parking. Everyone knows it. It's always busy. Everyone is a terrible driver. Get ready to park on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th floor or not at all. You'll be driving around for quite some time before you're satisfied and happy with your first floor parking space.",1
3,"If you are hungry, want small portions and pay outrageous amounts of money for less than mediocre service then you might consider eating her. Don't let Domino F serve you. Terrible service! We asked for extra napkins for a party of 6 and were only brought two. Drinks were expensive. $8 beers and $14 margaritas. Taco u -pick two plates are the best deal at $11. \n\nThere are way better places to eat in Vegas.",0
4,"One of the most pleasant dining experiences of my life.\n\nAs we arrived, we where greeted in a polite and formal manner. They took our coats and there was no wait to get to our seat.\n\nUnfortunately we were seated at the far back of the dining room away from any windows, so our view was only of the other patrons. The dining room is very spacious however, so even in the back corner we did not feel like we where stick in the corner. This was much appreciated, as I get claustrophobic in small dining rooms full of people like at Le Cirque.\n\nThe service throughout the night was professional, informed, and always there when we needed. They even toped up my wine a few times in between courses without saying anything.\n\nThe one dish that stood out the most was a giant scallop dish. It was so good, that we where obsessed with scallops for months after, looking for anything that tasted near as good.\n\nI will most certainly go back.",1
5,"Just tried this place on Friday night for the 1st time...and loved it. Very much like the little noodle restaurants hidden on little side streets all over Hong Kong. Just a small dive eatery, basic tables and minimal decor, chopsticks and spoons sitting in holders on the table for patrons to get themselves. The clientele was heavily Asian when we were there...as every table looked to have at least one Asian person, lending a degree of authenticity to the place. The menu is minimal, maybe 40 items in total, including soups and appetizers, and split in to four primary sections: appetizers, \""""special\"""" noodle dishes, soup noodles, and fried noodles. The noodles are made fresh for each dish, and after you order, you can watch the noodle guy making your noodles through a big window that separates the kitchen from the dining room. He pulls and stretches the dough, and 5 minutes later you're eating those noodles. Great noodles too!\nFor soup, we had the fish ball soup, which is roundish, white balls of fish stuffed with a ground pork mix, and cooked in soup. Very good. \nThe first dish that came out was the shrimp with corn noodles in curry, and that was great. We simply devoured that dish. We also had the seafood noodle soup, and that was good. Not as full of flavor as the curry dish, but a nice, standard Asian soup. A nice feature was the amount of squid included in the soup, and the cuttlefish ball.\nFinally, we had #34 on the menu, the spicy beef with the XO sauce (though we actually substituted chicken for the beef), and it definitely has a little bit of chili powder and kick. Not extremely hot, but just enough spice to mix with the flavor to produce a great dish. The only thing I'd change is that they were pretty heavy on the amount of onions in the dish, but overrall great dish.\nService was quick, efficient, tables are turned quickly, and food came out quickly. On top of that, the place is CHEAP! Most of the dishes are $5.95, at best, and several are under $5.",1
6,Went there around 1:15 PM on Sunday. We had to wait over 45 minutes to get our food which was cold and tasteless. The only thing that makes me give that restaurant a second star is the friendly waitress and because they offered us a drink and didn't charge for the coffees because we had to wait for so long.,0
7,"This is my favorite Mediterranean restaurant. What you'll find here is real Lebanese food, with standout lebni (soft cheese for dipping), kafta (skewered burger) and big pillows of hot pita.\n\nI go for the kibbi, because practically no one in town makes it, and nobody makes it like this. Kibbi is a shell of bulghur, lamb and spices encasing a filling of meat, onion, pine nuts and spices. It's a labor-intensive dish (I know...I've tried) and this is made with love. Served on a bed of fragrant pilaf and a yogurt dipping sauce, I'm in lamb-y, happy kibbi heaven every time I have it.\n\nFinish with the rice pudding. Seriously. It's wondrous.\n\nEveryone that says to call ahead is right. You take your chances when you just show up. But when you call ahead and get a machine, you can pretty much bet they're not open. Call twice just to be safe.",1
8,"I'm rarely in Scottsdale, but I had meetings all day.  I asked a coworker where to go for lunch and he made the suggestion we hit up Big City Bagels.  I'm so glad we did.  \n\nI had a BLT Bagel to fulfill my bacon craving.  The bacon was crispy and there was plenty of it.  The sandwich was great, filling without being heavy.  The veggies were fresh and tasty.  The staff was friendly and I was quite impressed.  Now I'm looking for a reason to go back to Scottsdale for another lunch!",1
9,"I think this restaurant deserves more than 3 stars. My girlfriend and I did the groupon and saved 10 dollar on our bill.\n\nFood was pretty good; will admit that the Strip pricing was a little hard to swallow, but the quality of service was great.\nI will be going back.",1
10,"What a wonderful evening to start out with happy hour and mike I or ( my guy ) excellent food from grilled shrimp to creme burlee fun friend, tequila... Had a great time mike was on top of it at least we were one of few customers on the patio.",1
11,"If you are in the area I much prefer Thai Elephant which is near by.  We did a taste test on the soup- Tom Yum and Tom Kha.  One night we ordered a bowl of each at Thai Elephant and the very next night we made the same order at Lemongrass Thai.  T.E won hands down.\n\nAlso, ordered what we thought was a vegetarian salad only to have to send it back and was told it had fish sauce on it.",0
12,"We went to Dixie's Tavern before the Bobcats Arena opened (i.e., when you could find free parking in Uptown).  We parked in Seventh Street Station (for free back then) and walked across the street to Dixie's.   Places like Roadhouse Grill, Logan's Roadhouse, and Texas Roadhouse are designed to look a bit rundown and...like a roadhouse.  Dixie's was unpurposefully like that.  It was smoky, a bit dirty, and a bit haggard in its appearance.  \n\nWe had a large group and Dixie's was able to accommodate us together.  The service we received was slllllllllooooooooow.  It was a good thing we didn't have anywhere to be, but I was losing my buzz in between beers.  The food was average; your basic bar food, some with a Cajun flair.  From the grungy feel of the restaurant, I wouldn't want to experiment too much with food here, especially where seafood is concerned.  \n\nIf you're in college, like to party, and in your early to mid-twenties, Dixie's may seem like a cool hangout place.  If you're anything else, there are better options in Uptown.",0
13,"We have received EXCELLENT care at VCA Nellis. Dr. Roehr is a very caring and profressional Veterinarian.We treat our dogs as if there were our children, giving them the best care possible is paramount. We have found it here at VCA Nellis.",1
14,"I've been getting used (it takes 21 days for it to become a habit? the experts say) to my new diet now (low-sodium), and have been going to Trader Joe's for the past six or seven straight weekends. While I can't find everything on my list, I can find nearly 90% of what I need for the upcoming week: no salt tortilla chips, low-sodium salsa, many vegetables, such as jalapenos, green bell peppers, pre-cut romaine lettuce leaves, lemons, bananas, apricots, and basil, granola, meat such as ground turkey and oh-so-cute mini hamburgers, equally-as-cute mini hamburger buns, lemonade, eggs, and frozen goods such as, vegetables, fruit (for smoothies), coconut frozen dessert, brown rice, fish and clams. \n\nAlthough, there are low-sodium options in chicken broth (still a little too high for my liking, though) and minestrone (better, and in moderation), the selection of beans are lacking in the \""""no-salt added\"""" department. I'm still trying to find low-sodium BBQ sauce, but that seems so hard-to-find (might have to make my one). \n\nAs far as convenience, this is the one closest to my house, compared to Whole Foods (more pricey too, guess I could go after work to the Town Square location, if need be; another option is to go to Sunflower after work, too) and the two Fresh & Easy stores which I loved, closed a while ago. But since adopting my new diet, I've found a new-found appreciation for this store, and will continue doing the bulk of my grocery shopping here. I've even got my husband doing his weekly shopping here too (meal bars, cereal, almond milk, pulled chicken). And, like me, he is reading labels for sodium content.\n\nThe first three sections (above) were written when I was pregnant in 2012. Ok, so you caught me, procrastinating...\n\nSo here's my update. We go here almost every week. I'm not on a super-strict low-sodium diet, but I still do watch my sodium intake during the weekdays (5 days out of the week). The truth is: there are so many good items to buy here, from the granola, the salads, the cheese (oh so many options!!!), the frozen mahi mahi burgers, chicken lime cilantro burgers, shepherd's bread, pasta sauce, orzo, frozen chicken breast, milk, etc. etc. etc. I can go on and on, but I 'll stop my rambling. \n\nNowadays, we do most of our grocery shopping here, then, Sam's Club, and sometimes, Sprouts, or Target, and if we are in the area, at Fresh & Easy.",1
15,First called and delivery would take over 1 hour. Decided to dine in and no one was there to take my order. It took a couple minutes for someone to realize I was ready to order. (Apparently messing around in the back.) While waiting for the pizza someone was juggling pizza dough and tossing it from one person to another.  Pizza was good but the flavored crust either sucked or wasn't applied. It was clean and pizza was ready really fast. My wife will probably go back but I will not.,0
16,I don't understand all the negative reviews I'm a picky person and I loved this place. For about 13.99 is not bad at all we went Saturday around 1:30 it was busy but not too busy food was delicious I just wishes there was more variety in the deserts I will be back,1
17,"Ive been here at this club 4 times and each time it was bottle service, more than 1500 each time. Some random girl was assaulted and her boyfriend decided to throw punches. Because we were not part of the confrontation we pushed our group aside. BUT because we pushed our group aside, so we can continue to enjoy our night, they decided we would b the easy group to blame. We were kicked out because we happened to b in the area, and it would b a quick fix liability wise.",0
18,"Now that I am flying back home to Miami, here is my full review on Hakkasan...\n\nTHE LINE... \n\nFirst, if you get in a \""""VIP Guest List\"""" and are told to simply go up and tell them you are on it, they will put you in a long ass line that was at least 800 people deep.  We went on Thursday, July 3rd - it was not a Ti\u00ebsto night. When we got in line (about 10:35pm), it wrapped out to one of the doors near some restrooms - total time in line to get to the people actually checking the guest list ~1 hour.... Your ID *will* be checked - depending on how young you look, maybe a few times. Saw someone kicked out of line for having an expired DL too, so make sure you have a good one!  There were people in line with tickets for the night ($30)... So, that doesn't get you in any faster FYI. \n\nDRESS CODE...\n\nGuys... There is a sign that states \""""dress code strictly enforced.\""""  I knew I was good... Figure if i can dress appropriately, everyone else should, right? WRONG! There were guys in line that got in wearing cheap solid color t-shirts, sleeveless t-shirts, and even tank tops. A few got in wearing polo shirts (borderline for a \""""high end\"""" club if you ask me).  Guys - wear a button-down shirt for goodness sakes!  Ladies were mostly dressed appropriately for the scene - but, I haven't been to many clubs where the ladies do not know how to dress. \n\nGETTING INSIDE...\n\nAfter you are \""""checked off\"""" the guest list, you approach another (final) ID check. Your wrist is stamped a second time and you are ushered to the register to pay to get in. Yes, we were on the guest list and didn't have to pay that night - the people that check you off earlier in line, issue you a \""""pass\"""" telling the cashier how many males vs. females in your party.  You turn in that paper are handed a receipt, and then ushered into a bank of elevators which they pack shoulder to shoulder... Ugh! \n\nONCE INSIDE...\n\nThe elevator doors opened on the 4th floor and in you go to a hallway leading up a couple of stairs to the dance area. The first thing I noticed is the relatively small (read - packed) dance floor.  The dance area is surrounded by VIP tables/booths. There are a few bars around the outskirts of the floor/VIP area. As for decor, well... I think a friend put it best in reaction to a video I posted on Instagram... It looks like a black box with lights inside!\n\nIf you are not a smoker, beware - you will get smoke in your face in this place. Sometimes you are walking along and poof! you walk into a cloud of smoke thanks to another patron. \n\nWe also explored the 5th floor, figuring one could look down on the dance floor below and see the DJ, etc. Another disappointment here... Once you get upstairs, the only way to look down on the floor and see the DJ, is if you have one of the VIP tables/booths up there. Otherwise, you are at least 6-8' back from the overlook and can't see anything really. \n\nBAR...\n\nIt's Vegas, so I figured it would be around $14-16 for a drink here. Ordered 2 goose with pineapple = $40 including tip.  The \""""glass\"""" tumbler is plastic (I've been to \""""cheaper\"""" clubs and they serve in actual glass - guess this place \""""can't afford\"""" the glass???  As for the alcohol to mixer content - I would say it was average. Not terrible, but not $20 worth in my book. \n\nBATHROOM...\n\nYou would think that a place the size of this one would have a decent restroom facility. I am sad to say that NO, it doesn't - at least the one I went to.  Once you get inside the bathroom, an attendant pretty much keeps things in check and\""""assigns\"""" you a urinal or stall based on availability... Sound great, except that there were only 3 urinals and two stall that I remember seeing. Once done, the attendants are extremely courteous and do their job really well - tip them, as it may be the only thing that actually worked well!\n\nOVERALL...\n\nI would NOT go again, unless there is a special event going on where I know I will see a favorite DJ. Even then, I would be hard pressed to pay for a ticket or be on a VIP guest list. The only way to do this place right is probably to get a table, and from what I understood is definitely in the thousand$. \n\nCan't wait to get back to Miami to go to a real nightclub!",0
19,"I went to the supposed Grand Opening of Joystixx Gamer's Lounge inside of Hooters last night after April S. and Melissa S. promoted it at the Vegas Young Professionals mixer Thursday night. As you drive in, you get the feeling that you are entering the ghetto as you try to maneuver around the parking garage. Once you enter the casino, it gets even worse, so much so that you are EXTREMELY lucky to get a cell signal in the place.  You find Joystixx in a corner near the buffet and they have an air hockey table and some pool tables near the front and at least 3 rows of video games as well as some basketball hoops and skee ball. I've been to Insert Coins on Fremont and that place is heaven compared to what Joystixx is trying to accomplish. My friends and I left after about an hour since there was no one in there. We don't think the place will last very long especially if they don't advertise or try to advertise as something they are obviously not. There is HONESTLY no comparison to Dave & Busters at all.  It's pretty bad when the employees outnumber the clientele.",0
20,"It's better than the other cafe at the Wynn, and while still very expensive, it's reasonable compared to other options in the hotel.  The food looked pretty fresh.  Unfortunately, the line takes forever.  I guess I am just used to the NYC lines that keep moving quickly, but it was frustrating waiting on this line.  We were really hungry and thought a deli place would be a quick place to get a sandwich.  Not so much.  After waiting online and finally ordering, we got our number and sat down.  and waited.  and waited some more.  We ordered a roast beef sandwich and chicken noodle soup, what could we possibly have to wait for?  Finally it came and it was decent.  The waiter asked if we wanted a refill on our drink (which we did), and mustard (which we also did), but fifteen minutes later he never returned, so we just finished our food and left.  \n\nMaybe we just had a bad service experience and it's normally better.  The food was decent without being exceptional.",0
21,"Nice alternative for an afterwork dinner.  Exceptional service and reasonable prices.  Food and beverages offered are awesome, and if you enjoy something simple, the chocolate chip cookies for desert are a great surprise.  The sports bar atmosphere doesn't feel as canned as some others... great staff attitude goes chapters in making a nice experience.",1
22,"I came to the Hard Rock Cafe for the first time in my life, totally alone in Vegas, and I hella dig it here.  The crowd around the bar are varied and chill, and the bartenders are insanely nurturing.  I must have been asked \""""are you all right, honey?\"""" at least 8 times.\n\nThere's a fantasmic-shmastic mixed drink here called the Pickled Tink: raspberry Stoli, pina colada and Grenadine.  I had two.  Also, their french fries can't be beat.",1
23,"Sooooooooooo disappointed. I was so exited about a new breakfast place opening in the neighborhood, and I was thoroughly let down. \n\nPoints to note:\n-*Roast* potatoes (as listed on the menu) are not the same as overly salted and dill-filled lumpy mush potatoes (and I usually LOVE salt, dill and mush more than most).\n-Decaf coffee and regular coffee should be served at the same (hot) temperature.\n-Pancakes should not be glue-y messes.\n-Eggs shouldn't be rubbery.\n-Everything is an \""""extra\"""" (coffee was not included etc...)\n-$20 is too much to pay for a good plate of eggs, much less a sh***y one.\n-Even if your server doesn't speak your language, they should be gracious about it. Especially in a Anglo-heavy neighborhood like the Concordia ghetto.\n- Restaurants should offer you something as compensation for mistakes or lousy food, not make excuses or justifications.\n-There was almost nothing on the menu my vegan friend could eat, in-buttered toast and fruit just about covered it. Even the potatoes said \""""may contain lard\"""". \n\nI would give this no stars if I could, or even negative stars. NEVER going back again.\n\nOnly positive: the fruit bowl was beautiful, expensive, and beautiful.",0
24,"During my 5 nights stay at Ritz,  I went to  Bistro 24 for breakfast my first morning.  I experienced very slow service for Ritz standards.  I had to wait a while for someone to wait on.  It was not even busy.  For the next 4 days, I just walked across the street to Starbucks.",0
25,"I was pretty disappointed with Steve's Espresso.  Considering its moniker, you'd think the espresso would be good here.  It wasn't.  My espresso was bitter and a touch sour.  It was drinkable, but that's hardly a recommendation.  \n\nI tried one of their breakfast pastries, with cheese, bacon, and egg.  I was even less impressed with that.  I was surprised when the cashier handed it to me and told me I should go microwave it myself in an oven they have by the door.  I was told to put it in for 45 seconds.  I figured they would know their business and trusted what I was told.  After I left I decided to sneak a bite while stopped at a light.  The thing was ice cold in the center.  Great.  A bacon, egg and cheese-icle.  Even the part around the edge that was warm wasn't that great.  The dough tasted like it came out of a tube.  I probably would have been better off with something else.  There were several baked goods in the case that looked amazing.\n\nThe person that helped me seemed really nice, so I kind of feel bad giving the place such a hard review.  Honestly, most people would probably be happy with the drinks here, especially if you're the sort that pumps a bunch of sugary crap into your drink. \n\nAccording to a sign on the door they specialize in French press coffee, so ordering that might be a better bet.  But if that's the case, why doesn't he call the place Steve's French Press Coffee?  Either way, I won't be risking another stop here.",0
26,"Its Cheap, Its Fast, Its Yummy.....err not too sure on the fast part, because sure it takes a while to make them. I met one of the guys who worked there and told me about the place. Tried the double burger with the grilled potatoes. They tasted delicious and the price cheap.",1
27,"I'm at Grand right now and about to check out. I just have to write this before I leave.\n\nHotel room is very nice, modern, new and clean, however, there is only one tiny gift shop and few restaurants.  The self parking is really really long walk and for female guest like me is very scary to walk there even during the day time co silts isolated. Elevator is dirty and dark. Saw graffiti and strange people are hanging around and loud loud music are being played at somewhere. And most of all it's very dirty. Worst of all, parking ticket machine cannot read guest park bar code so far we had to pay $5 and $9 for two nights. And we are about to go home, I'm sure we have to pay again for the 3rd time, even front desk said should be fine after failed twice. They said something wrong with the parking machine. So in order for us to get credit we have to charge to room for some expenses, but since it's a promotion stay and room is comped we had to force ourselves to buy coffees and so but still not enough to cover to get credit full amount.  So we will eat these parking fees at this time. I know it's free to stay what is a big deal for some, but it's a basic service issue and still I am not happy with this situation. \n\nWell,  I could have used the valet in that case but I go out and back and force bet. hotel and stores and shops for 4-5 times a day, paying the $2-3 tips each time will cost more. Bit I guess since the parking situation was so bad I should have used the valet......bit I have no issue with other hotels at downtown. \n\nWe have no plan to come back to this hotel so far from these experiences. If you are female or elderly guests I do not recommend to stay here, I am concern for safety issue with parking and around this hotel's environment especial after dark.",0
28,"I decided to try this place after reading all the reviews, boy was i wrong!!\n\nI live in Orange County, was in town decided go out the way to this place instead of eating the overpriced food in the hotel.  Low and behold it's definitely overpriced for not so great food.  I'm not a food snob, but I'd like to think I know what great food tastes like. \n\nOxtail chili fries (what oxtail??) - can't taste the Oxtail and the chili itself is somewhat odd tasting left like a sour after taste. 2 stars \n\nDuck Steamed buns - nice presentation, but duck was cooked a bit rare and so tough that you can't even take a bite without pulling all the meats off.  I've had better...I told the server and he was nice enough to it take off the bill. 1 star\n\nMiso Burger - I thought it tasted pretty good, flavors all work together. 3.5 stars\n\nShogun Burger - Of course the server recommended this burger, it's the most expensive burger on the menu $25.  First off all if you don't know what Unagi is it's (eel) not everyone is familiar with the term.  My son who I think is a food snob wanted to try it, I only noticed it had Foie Gras.  Since it's illegal to eat Foie Gras in California, I thought we're in for a treat.  Let me tell you this burger combination is terrible...It has eel, Foie Gras, Pear, and beef, how does all this come together???!! Fish, beef, duck and pear in a bite is so weird and it left a fishy after taste, totally not what we expected.  \n\nAt the end the meal for 3 people cost $70 that's we 3 drinks and with the steamed duck buns taken off the bill.  \n\nI'll take the all you can eat buffet at the hotels anytime...sorry Bachi Burger you're overrated!",0
29,"Wow, first of all, I'm from Socal and I didn't expect to find a gem of a sushi joint like this in vegas.\n\nDidn't feel like paying big bucks for overrated pricey sushi joints on the strip, so we decided to hit this place up as a recommendation from a friend.\n\nI was blown away by how many items they had on their AYCE menu. Suppppper thrilled to order every single item possible to try.\n\nTheir nigiri was superb because the fish was really fresh and sweet. The best has to be the white tuna! The sweet shrimp and uni definitely had to be my favorite, and it sucked that you can only order it once.\n\nAll their rolls were very unique and each one satisfied my tastebuds. The best part was that they allowed half orders on the rolls, so you can try more!\n\nThe icing on the cake was the selection of ice cream at the end. From tempura, to mochi, to red bean... It was heaven\n\nCan't wait to come back to Vegas in 2 weeks and hit up this spot again. BEST AYCE sushi I've ever had, and that's coming a lot from someone who's had multiple hot spots in socal. \n\nTHUMBS WAY UP",1

31,"I went in for dinner with my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday and was highly disappointed in our experience. We sat down at the table, which was only half set, and it took ten minutes for a server to come over and greet us, which if the restaurant was busy I could have maybe understood, but it was a Thursday night and the place was far from packed.  We ordered a bottle of wine off the list to celebrate and when the server returned he opened the bottle and poured our glasses out and walked away without informing us that the bottle we had originally selected was unavailable and had given us a younger year. As all of this was happening someone came by our table and slung down a huuuge long break stick directly on the table  along with some sort of corn/cheese concoction and walked away. By this time we were ready to order antipasti, a cheese and meat selection..which was delivered in the same quick fashion, and when we stopped the gentlemen who delivered it to ask what the different varieties of meats and cheeses were he had no clue, took a stab at it...and of course, was incorrect.  The selection on the menu was okay, nothing to write home about. The truffle pasta I had was good but when I asked my boyfriend how his pasta with marinara sauce was his only reply was \""""the sauce you make is better \"""" and this from an Italian restaurant. Our server only came by one time to check on us after the food got there and by the time he did, it really wouldn't have made a difference what we thought of our meals because they were practically over. There was a server nearby for a good portion of the meal though, stocking and refilling their silverware drawers. SOOO loudly that we had to raise our voices to speak above the noise. Which all in all we might not have noticed if it had not been silent in the restaurant. They were playing absolutely no music at all. The server came over to give us the check without even offering dessert,  which we definitely wanted seeing as we were celebrating his birthday and we had mentioned to the server originally when we sat down and then had to remind him of when we expressed that we were not ready and wanted to  looking at the dessert menu after making through the rest of the meal. Our terimusu was good, probably the best thing we had all night along with the lemonchello for dessert. Would we go back anytime soon...for the food probably, for the service..probably not. They could definitely use some help in that department. But from what I've heard being a local in the service industry out here in Vegas, the rumor is that Onda along with others in the Mirage are going to be undergoing changes, and with that I'm sure will we be back for a second shot.",0
32,"It's only open for take out and lunch, but its so good.  If you're a 1st timer, ask how to order, he's no Nazi, but you may not know what your looking at.  Try lots of sides and veggies.  Everything I've tried was fresh, healthy, and delicious.",1

34,I have never been so disappointed in an oil change! First they took my car and told me they would contact me when it was ready so I was free to do some shopping in Costco next door.  They never called.  I walked back over to pick up my car to find they never touched it and refused to work on it.  They said they heard a noise in the engine and would not tell me what it was.  (I had it checked out at different place).  Sears told me my engine could blow up at any moment.  All that was wrong was the O2 sensor was broken (nothing to cause and engine to blow up).  These guys were just lazy and did not want to do any work.  They chose to scare me instead.  I will never go back to a Sears Auto Center for anything.,0
35,"This one is specific to the steakhouse. While the prices are a bit high, it is expected since it is a tourist attraction and does have the additional cost of being a \""""Old West\"""" attraction.  That being said, they had a $10 - 10oz deal on fillet or strip steak.  The sides are not the most exciting, but the steaks here have a great flavor and mine have always come cooked to temp.  AND you get great live music (mostly country and western, but they throw in some others). I would recommend taking the kids and enjoy all Rawhide has to offer.\n\nNote- call and make a reservation, sometimes the place is wide open, others booked to capacity (tourist buses), so planning can help make sure you get a seat.",1
36,"You know that local eatery that is your \""""go to\"""" for food that is quick, pretty cheap, and pretty yummy?  That place that you swing through for take out on a busy weeknight, or stop for lunch when you are out running errands?  Toyama is that place for us.  Our standard order is the hibachi chicken or steak (some of us sub the mushrooms out for broccoli).  To me, the sweet carrots are TOO sweet, and I sub broccoli for that, but the kids love them.  Go easy on the shrimp sauce, as it is super high fat/cal, but it is yummy for sure.  Wasn't as fond of the noodles, but I think I have only gotten them once out of the dozens of dishes I have ordered there, so it also could have been an anomaly.  I usually call first (as do many people) and they have our take out order ready and bagged up, and a special line to check you out.  Appreciate that a lot!",1

I've been craving it ever since and cannot wait to return. I'm serious, it was a hot, steaming bowl of freshly steamed vegetables with rice and a fantastic curry sauce. I want to eat this every day! Our server even told me that she actually DOES eat this every day and has since they put it on their menu. It was a huge bowl, so I took half of it home with me so I could enjoy a second meal of leftovers. \n\nNow drop everything and order this curry!\n\nAnd order a piece of pie or enjoy an iced sugar cookie, too.",1

So when it was time for me to choose a place for bridesmaids to get their  hair and make and make up done for my special day, I chose Joleon Salon and day spa. They  did an amazing job on my hair and makeup for the bridesmaids and myself.   The Hairstylist and make up crew met us at Rainbow Gardens at 7am and their timing was perfect. By the time they finished my makeup the limo arrived:) They made sure we looked Beautiful.  Andrea was there to make sure everything was going according to schedule, and that everything was perfect.

40,"This place is always extremely crowded with people and merchandise, especially during the Halloween season. Most of the temp help is around 15 years old (and lack basic customer service skills), and the store is dark, dirty and disorganized. I hate going to this store.\n\nI put my feelings aside yesterday because they had a Halloween costume I really wanted. Actually, I THOUGHT they had the costume I wanted, since I called them, they said they had it, and allegedly they put it on hold for me. However, when I arrived the costume was nowhere to be found and they had no extras. After waiting over 10 minutes to talk to a manager, I was offered no apology, no explanation and only the option of checking other stores inventory. After spending another 20 minutes of my life while the manager called two more stores (none of which had my costume) I left empty handed and irritated.\n\nFrom now on I will go to great lengths of inconvenience to never set foot in this store again.",0
41,"We had a hard time finding the place. After passing it and doing a u turn we realized it's in the same building as sapphire gentlemens club. That was a bit of a turn off and we considered not going, but I'm very  happy we did. \nOnce inside the place is very nice. We went for happy hour (3-6 every day) for $1 tacos. I had one of each of their five street tacos. All were great as was the service. Paco the chef came to our table to make sure everything was ok. That's always a nice touch. We will be back soon.",1
42,"It is really hard to understand how people can ask for a higher wage with a straight face when they are as clearly unskilled as the employees at this McDonald's.  I worked for McDonald's from 1986 to 1992, and that company I worked for doesn't exist any more. QSCV? Never heard of that. \n\nThe biggest problem I have with this store is they are clearly training people to put condiments and cheese slices only half way on the burger, and the other half hanging off the side into the box. Maybe it's some kind of gourmet asymmetrical food or something? I just don't get it.\n\nNo seriously. Note to owner... from a former manager, Arizona is a right to work state, meaning you can fire people for any reason without even telling them why. So, you can solve this problem in probably a week. Just fire people on the spot of they can't line up a cheese slice in the middle of a round object. It's silly for such people to have jobs. You do that three or four times, problem solved. Nobody will ever do it again. Serious. We only had to do it once.",0
43,"In its heyday (80s and 90s) I would have given it 4 stars, but it just doesn't have that mall energy or buzz any more. It has too many cheap specialty shops.

44,"This was the first Vegas club/lounge I went to... and boy, was it a forgettable one. \n\nFirstly, the venue is packed with guys... with an occasional woman here and there, however, since there is no dance area really, the herds of men shower the bar area while the few women stand on the outside of the watering hole that are the main bars. The Guy-girl ratio was a good 15-1... not my type of venue. Coyote Ugly also draws in an older crowd (which is okay, but not for someone who just turned 21). The music was not very good and our entertainment consisted of bar tenders dancing on bar tops and encouraging middle-aged women to do something \""""crazy\"""" like dancing on a bar top. Conversely, the herds of men watch and watch and watch for something crazy to happen... and nothing ever does. \n\nI don't see how this place could be satisfying for men or women. The only niche I see for Coyote Ugly is drawing in a middle-aged crowd seeking to get away from the pretentious Vegas scene and be in a venue where you will not really be bothered.

46,"We've been to Bacon Bar several times, and the food has always been very good and very consistent. My favorite item is the Bacon Burger; it's literally the BEST burger I've ever had! In fact, I love it so much, I can't seem to order anything else for my entree! Lol My husband had the Bacon Sloppy Joe and said it was very good. Must've been, since he ate the whole thing in about 5 minutes flat and he never eats much. The Man Candy is decadent, as it's served with Crown Royal Maple infused syrup. YUM!! I like that they have a lot of items on the menu other than bacon. I looooove bacon, so I'm in heaven when we eat there, but my daughter likes other things, so there's a good selection for her to choose from.\n\nThe service is good to very good and the servers have always been friendly. We always sit at the bar so we can play the machines. We've never won anything significant so the machines seem to be a little tight, but each time our drinks/beers were comped. We would go to Bacon Bar more, but it's about a 25 minute drive from our house.",1

No. I finally called back an hour after that, and after a few tries, he finally answered and said the cleaners' car had broken down and that they would come the next day instead. However, he had forgotten to ask them what time they'd be there and so promised he'd call me right back with the time. I didn't hear from him. I called the following day and a woman answered the phone. I explained what happened, she apologized, and promised to have someone come that day. She said she'd call in ten minutes to let me know when they would arrive. That was three days ago. I still haven't heard back. \n\nIn short, don't waste your time or your money.",0

There was no Bolognese sauce, just minced meat on top of pasta... and really mozzarella in Mac n' Cheese? SIGH.

I recommend too as suggested to get milkshakes with the burgers. I got the burnt almond one. It had a little too much whipped cream but was enjoyable.  Place had many empty tables for a weeknight and the popularity. Glad i ordered burger pink and red.

I have no idea what they put in those refried beans, but baby they are some good eats. I could have had a bowl of that with the jerk fried rice and I would have been happy. My mom wanted a little bit of it all, so ordered a carnita burrito, jade chicken, beans, and jerk fried rice. I kept it simple with just the jerk fried rice and the jerk chicken.

Yes, the drinks are overpriced and yeah, it's flooded with Asians (I am Asian and I don't give a crap) but if you don't like it, go to a different club. It can get insanely crowded and I can't believe people wait in that ridiculous line to get in.

Surely I deserve that at least.\n\nThe rant continues - the toilets- SORT THEM OUT. They are covered in graffiti about how harry potter has changed lives....... yawn.

73,"The last time I was in Pittsburgh for baseball was the late 90s at Three Rivers when I was a teenager. When I saw my Braves were going to be here in August, my brother and I planned a day trip down from Western NY. We were both very impressed with PNC Park and the surrounding area. \n\nWe waited next to the right field gate before we could get in. There was a little fence with a concrete bench attachment across the access road we could sit in and enjoy the shade. Only waited about 3-4 minutes in line once the gates opened. They check bags, but you can bring one that is 16x16x8 in and you can bring up to a 24 oz disposable water bottle in for each person. Could get in 1.5 hours before and the Braves were about halfway through batting practice when we got there so we went to our seats to watch. \n\nI picked up tickets (dugout box) at box office price on StubHub in March, but people around us said they got tickets right from the Pirates website this week there too. The seats were very nice. Patted bottoms, wide enough that you weren't totally squished. I was lucky and no one sat the in the two seats next to me even. There was a nice attendant for the section that cleaned off the seats and welcomed us in. He did a good job making sure kids got foul/extra balls and getting autograph hawks out of the way before the game. Though I would have liked to see the whole park enforce not having people go to their seats during game play. \n\nI walked around some and they had many different choices for food but the lines were pretty long about 30-45 minutes before the game. Prices were typical for a ball park, though I think $4 for a bottle of water and $5 for a 20oz bottle of pop are excessive. $9 for a higher end milkshake, $5-9 for Dippin Dots, etc.  I was full from the early dinner we ate so I had a Lemon Chill cup. It was like 16oz and only $5.50, so I enjoyed it for like half of the game and it hit the spot. My brother got Nachos later with two cups of the cheese, jalapenos, and onions on it and an Iron City Beer. \n\nWe parked at the W. General Robinson garage across the street and it was an easy in and out to get back on 279-N HOV lane and get out of downtown. \n\nI'd definitely look to come back to Pittsburgh and catch more games in the future.",1
74,"I went based on the reviews and found the show to be boring. Some of the men are hot, most not so much. The guys cater to the audience. They interact with numerous ladies in the audience and make sure to include them, which is great. But the effort that the men put into the dances onstage was lacking. I felt that  the costumes and dances were cheesy and the show was not worth the amount of money that we paid. The guys didn't seem into it, and the overall creativity and organization of the show was terrible. Had a much better time watching Jabbawockeez. It was also a little too short time-wise. The drink service was terrible, with only two waitresses for the entire audience. No food available, the bar was disorganized. My friend saw \""""Fantasy\"""" and said that it was much more creative and that the women showed way more effort and interest in the show that they were doing (surprise, surprise).

75,Amazing sandwiches all for only $5.99! 24 hr restaurant! Really good deal especially since it's inside Planet Hollywood on the strip. \n\nThe bread they use is really soft. Loved it. I got the caprese and everything was fresh and delicious. Definetly the place to go to for late night snack or if you want a good sandwich for cheap.,1
76,"If you are price conscious and have shopped the competition, then you can rack up serious savings at WinCo (that even beats WalMart and Food 4 Less in some cases). But if you're not careful you will end up paying prices that are higher than Albertsons and closing in on what Whole Foods charges. \n\nStore Layout: If it's not packed it's not bad to get through. And it's new so you don't get the dull and dingy feeling that Food 4 Less leaves one with.\n\nBulk Foods: is worth a close look, pricing is good, selection is surprising, but it's usually a zoo to get in and out of. \nProduce: If the item is on the Dirty Dozen list for pesticides I buy organic at Whole Foods or Vons. But for everything else WinCo's pricing is very good, and the quality is better than I expected \nMeat: Until they say they refuse to carry anything with \""""pink slime\"""" I stay away from any beef unless I know the brand / source. Lunchmeat, hotdogs, etc are competitive. Poultry is cheaper at Cardenas Markets..substantially so. \nDairy: They carry Meadow Gold cottage cheese made here in Las Vegas which tastes better than the stuff made in Texas. \nCanned Goods: Private labels are where you save the serious $$$. And so far the quality has been very good or exceeding private labels at Smith's, Vons, Albertsons, Food 4 Less, and WalMart. \n\nYes it can be a zoo, sometimes the checkout lines are long, but again if you know your prices you can save serious $$$ here.",1
77,"We waited over 15 minutes to get our food! The place was almost empty. When I went to ask why it was taking so long they said it would be right out. The food then came out cold and not very good. The potato wasn't hot, chopped salad had huge pieces of lettuce. I wouldn't go back.",0
78,"Haven't been to Mac's on South Blvd for a good long time so I was pleased to see that the quality is still the same as ever! Great service on the front patio for a Sunday afternoon and I totally enjoyed my BBQ chicken with Texas toast, green bean casserole and MAC & cheese!\nHooray for keeping this place up.",1
79,"NOT a favorite spot, but it's close to home. It always takes FOREVER to get a drink at the bar & their food is all nasty fried food. Nothing tasty. Wouldn't recommend this place unless you have low standards or just want a beer.",0
80,"We went to Greasewood Flat after hearing good things about it from a few different people. It was a Friday night and the place was packed! For being (seemingly) in the middle of nowhere, I was surprised how many people were there, young and old. \n\nIf you're ordering food, you go up to the window to the right of the entrance. We had the bacon green chili burger, pulled pork and the cowboy beans. It was all tasty and fairly priced. They had live music, plenty of alcohol and several fire pits to keep people warm. Unfortunately, I've heard through the grapevine that Greasewood Flat is closing soon:( It's too bad we waited this long to try it, because I'm sure it would be a place we'd visit often.",1
81,"The food here is everything they say it is, but the small place is not very easy to find, even with a GPS! It's to the right of Panda Express right next door to the Burger King on West Elliot, if that helps. You should enjoy this place while it's still swinging for the fences and being run by the friendly man who started it, because it will surely be a multi-location chain in the near future! Unbelievably inexpensive for the high quality product!",1

84,"I have not been impressed with Fitchburg Vet.  We have had our dog since he was a puppy, and we know him very well.  He has always had a sensitive stomach to food, but we knew he wasn't sick because he was acting just like himself.  We kept asking the vets about it, and they told us he was sick and needed a fecal, even though his last 2 were both negative.  I finally got the best advice from Pet Supermarket (best pet store in town in my opinion) and they told us about limited ingredient and grain free food.  within 24 hours his poop was normal again.  The vets wouldn't even listen to me, and just kept telling me he was sick.  I was really disappointed that I had to go to a pet store to get advice that the vet should have known.",0
85,"Came here with my boyfriend and had a great time. Iris was our server and she was fantastic. Very knowledgable and friendly. We ordered the hummus and it was pretty tasty. I got the chicken dish with mashed potatoes, mushrooms, artichoke hearts and Dijon sauce. Not a big fan of the sauce but everything else was fantastic. Andre got the ribeye with veggies instead of the traditional sides and he was very happy with it. He raved about it and told the sever how fantastic it was. Carlos (the owner and chef) came out to our table and talked with us about it and Andre told him again how fantastic it was. We'll definitely be back!",1
86,"This place never fails at being just terrible. Don't get me wrong, love the mojitos, but dang is the service just BAD. I always try to give it the benefit of the doubt thinking that they have GOT to have things figured out by now, but I am always wrong. Always. \n\nShall I explain why? Oh ok, if you insist. \n\nOne of the first times I was there, I ordered a salad. Waited 10 min for silverware. 2 of the MAIN ingredients were not present (pomegranates and avocado). When I asked why they said they were out of pomegranates, and didn't know why the avocado wasn't on it. So they bring me the avocado, and might I add that it was 10 minutes AFTER I finished the wimpy salad. When I get my bill, guess what I was charged for...A SIDE OF AVOCADO. I voiced my issues to my server, and then never saw him again. Then drinks took forever, when it was not even busy. I just had it. I have never been so baffled with the service at a restaurant so I asked to speak to the manager just simply to tell him how things were going so he was aware of how things were being handled. Let's just say he wasn't good with constructive confrontation. \n\nWent there the other day and had the same lousy experience. BUT I do want to say that our server JAMILA was really nice and on top of things for our table. \n\nJust a few side notes of things that surprised me. \n\n1. 3 dollars for ROX. \n2. Signage of deals for the day/hour are not clear. \n3. The amount of ice they crush into the glass is very overwhelming. We ordered the buckets and it was all ice! I was bummed with how much of a buzz I didn't experience.",0
87,"It was Anniversary time! But we didn't' want to spend a ton of money on food or booze. Plus, were weren't interested in going to a show at the time. So, what to do?\n\nAquarium!\n\nDon't get me wrong: This place is TINY! Narrow walk ways and close quarters in general. Even the exhibits are small. I do hope that all of the animals in there are ok. They do seem treated well but I wonder if they would be happier with larger homes. i think the most open area is at the very end, the shark tank.\n\nSpeaking of said tank, it was TOTALLY the highlight of this place. They built it so it looks like a sunken ship and it is SO creepy. It's very dark and all these frikin horrifying sharks are swimming around...\n\n...Their eyes... Dead eyes...\n\n\nI will admit that it is overpriced. Like... REAL overpriced. Over $30.00 per person!? Not to mention (totally mentioning) the picture when you leave is stupid expensive. $20.00 for 1 picture? That is Disneyland prices! Are we IN Disneyland!? No we are not. Check yourself my friend.\n\nStill it is one of the only places left in Vegas that doesn't have practically naked women for all the little kids to see. Points for that.",0
88,"Canaletto Ristorante The Venetian\n\nMade reservations on OpenTable. com.  We dined early because we were going to see some shows.\n\nWe were seated promptly at an outside table on the plaza.\n\nOur waiter Alexande was GREAT.  He was very attentive, personable, gave some great recommendations and overall one of the best waiters I have had.\n\nWe ordered a cheese plate.  Good selection of cheeses, with grapes, pears and jalape\u00f1o jelly.  Just enough for the two of us.\n\nI ordered the Osso Bucco with risotto and we also ordered the tagliatelle with pork.\n\nThe osso bucco was very tender and had good flavor. I would have liked a little more flavor in the sauce but overall it was good.  The risotto was excellent.  It was saffron and served properly.\n\nThe tagliatelle was good. Excellent flavors.  \n\nGood size portions for each serving.\n\nDifferent breads served with olive oil. All were fresh.\n\nThis restaurant is at the Venetian but is run by the IL Fornailo restaurant chain.  I think this is a cut above the basic restaurant chain in service and product.\n\nWe will be back.\n\nThis isn't a cheap restaurant at 40.00 pp really not that bad for the quality.",1
89,"I wasn't sure what sort of beer/cider/mixed drink to get, so I asked for a drink menu. The bartender informed me, between sips of her own drink, that they don't have any drink menus due to the fact that they're getting new ones. I don't know why they wouldn't keep the old ones until the new ones were ready, but apparently Moose Winooski's, which is in large part a BAR, has been without a drink menu for some time.\n\nMy husband got a couple beers on tap, and I got a vodka soda. My drink was fine, but my husband was feeling sick before we left, and I didn't feel great after having a few sips of his beer. I obviously can't say with certainty that it was due to the beer, but it did make me feel concerned. The service from our waiter was good, and there were no issues with the food, so I'm giving two stars for that.\n\nThe weirdest thing about all of this was that two days after our visit, I got a social media connection request from a senior member of the staff. As I was the person who paid, I can only assume that this staff member took my name from the credit card receipts and then looked me up. I think this is inappropriate.",0
90,"I had overpriced pho here. It was just ok. The noodles were over-cooked and the soup was just ok. I love my traditional pho. I would not come back here if I had the choice. Maybe for some other dish, but not for pho.",0
91,"Service was horrible.  Six of us went to dinner and as we have done for 20 years, brought our 20-30 year old wines to enjoy with dinner.  In the past, we paid $25-$50 corkage which was fine.  Cut limited us to only 2 bottles for 6 people.  We had 5 people, and of course we wanted to sit together, so we negotiated to get 3 bottles.  We tried to split tables as we get 2 per table, but they wouldn't let us do that.  So, we agreed to open 3 bottles.  They would charge $50 corkage.  That's $50 to open and drink a bottle of wine we brought to the restaurant.  They would waive that corkage fee if we bought a bottle from them equal to or greater in value than $50.  \nSo, we sat down and ordered our first 2 bottles of wine for $50 each, minimum.  Another person appeared and told us that, as our wines may have been worth more than $50, we would have to buy a bottle from them equal to or greater in value than each bottle we were opening.  Scott said he had bought his 2 bottles for about $10 in the 1990's.  Who knows what they're worth now?  They appeared prepared to haggle over the value of our wines.  This was such nonsense, we finally just got up and left.  They didn't try to stop us.  \nLast year, Carnevino accepted us without such stupid rules and we were allowed to bring our own wines.  We were told this is Wolfgang Puck's rules, so we had no choice.  In reality, they just wanted us to pay for hyper inflated wines from their wine list - they charge 4 or 5 times the market price of a wine - and also pay them for over priced steaks, together with terrible service.  We left, found Morel's, a much better restaurant, and enjoyed our wines and a great dinner.  The wait staff was attentive, helpful and appreciative.  Cut is not a place to eat if you want to be treated well, unless you have a huge wallet and willing to unload it there.\nNone of our party will ever patronize a Wolfgang Puck restaurant in this lifetime.  We encourage you to do the same.",0
92,"I didn't find it that bad, but it certainly wasn't good. It's a shame this place doesn't live up, because it's a neat-looking little diner in a great location. Service was typical Montreal aloof, food was not worth the time. Do yourself a favor and go to Cosmos down the street, or anywhere else at all really.",0
93,"I was finally able to visit the Trilogy this year after hearing so many good things and positive reviews from within the haunt community and from friends with first hand experiences. I am so glad I finally did!\n\nThis is everything that I have missed about haunted houses. I live in Los Angeles, so there's no shortage of haunts in October, but so many of them are pretty big and hire people that say \""""boo\"""" and want a paycheck rather than hiring people who love it and get it. Freakling only allows a few people in at a time, so you don't have to worry about getting stuck in a conga line and seeing a scare too early. They also treat everyone equal. I'm a tattooed male and in most haunted houses, I get left alone so they can focus on the screaming girl within the group. Freakling doesn't care at all about who you are or if they think they can/can't scare you...they just go for it and it's amazing!\n\nMost people have covered the separate houses in other reviews. I loved them. So many cool effects and illusions that make you go...WHOA! I was so impressed with all of them.\n\nNow...The Victim Experience. I wanted to try this last year, but couldn't make a trip to Vegas work. I signed up as soon as tickets went on sale for this year. I did it and survived. I can't talk about what happened inside, but I will say that it was one of the most brutal (mentally and physically) experiences I've ever had. After surviving, I felt like I could take on the world. It was such an accomplishment. If you decide that you want to take on the next level of extreme haunt....I wish you the best! If you survive, you will feel amazing and be part of the Freakling family instantly:)",1
94,"Awesome setting and great food. The breads they serve in the beginning are awesome. I also had the onion soup, rib eye steak, and the fingerling potatoes as a side. The steak was definitely one of the best that I've ever had. The beef quality was great. They also use some special sauce with mustard seeds on the steak that just makes it taste even better. The soup was real good but the flavor was a bit strong. Fingerling potatoes were ok I would say their taste were pretty much neutral with the steak. The place is a bit on the pricey side but I knew that going in of course. Was definitely a great dining experience.",1
95,"This is Luciano's second location with the first one being in Duluth.  The food was very fresh and tasty, the service was very good, and the decor is nice.  It is a little pricey and even with a $25 discount our bill was a little steep for what we got.  I had the special spinach stuffed tortellini with shrimp in vodka sauce.  It was good but not worth the $24 price tag.  The gelato and cappuccino were authentic, especially the latter.   It was real Italian style and not the steamed kind like you get in American coffee shops.  Others have raved about the chopped salad but it was just iceberg lettuce in oil, something I can do for about 50 cents at home and easily.",1
96,"I used to live right up the street from this restaurant and as a result came here several times.  I don't think that there is any way I'd return though.  I have literally never felt good after eating here - whether it was a hazy, late night encounter and getting sick in the morning, or more of a standard evening dinner and getting sick at night.  Maybe I'm allergic to some sort of special, exclusive ingredient they use...",0
97,"Not sure when they opened up, but I was excited to finally get to try their infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate.  Let me just say that while it was good (blended very smoothly with no chunks of ice), it wasn't $8.50 + tax good.  You can get three other shakes for the same price of one 16-oz of these.  If you want ice cream with it, it's another $1.50, and the 24 oz. for $14.50.  I liked that they had a \""""To Go\"""" window from which you could order from (line wasn't too bad but got longer later), but I wouldn't pay that much money again for it.  They also have a crazy $1000 dessert - who the hell spends that much on dessert, even if it does have edible 23-karat gold leaves??  The rest of their menu is not quite as ridiculous, though everything is overpriced in general.",0
98,"Fast food Chinese is generally not that exciting, but I must say this place really was quite impressive. Very fresh tasting ingredients with a lot of good flavors, all served hot and with a smile. What more could you ask for?",1
99,"I ordered a blush with Boba my first time here. Let me tell you, I am never going back again. It tasted bitter and it was very chunky at the top and watery at the bottom.

100,"I'm from Detroit and love a good Coney dog but this Jerk ruined it with his shrewd attitude.  I now live in Las Vegas and was in the area.  I ask if there are any military discounts and he replied so quick and nonchalantly one could surely take offense.  Then I ask if there are 'industry' discounts, he asks what industry and I tell him (Chris or Drew- the black guy with hazel eyes) that I'm a bartender.  He says no again so I try to joke it up with him to cool things out and he blatantly brushes it off in a hurried manner as if I'm bothering him.  To top it all off, my pop was a little more than half full that he fixed for me and he did not provide me with a fork which I do believe is standard.   It makes me want to just keep going to Hot Doggery on the strip and their not as good but the customer service is GREAT!!!  \nThis guy is acting like I was trying to pick up on him; honey after 8 years serving my country I think I've come across some with better jobs than your arrogant for no reason behind!!!!!",0
101,This review is for the LARGE animal clinic (horses and livestock). I had a bad experience with the small animal clinic where they were prepared to do $1800 worth of tests on my elderly cat to MAYBE diagnose (not treat) her without discussing the cost with me!? BUT the LARGE animal clinic is awesome! It is the only place in town that will look at chickens. My backyard chickens are kind of a hybrid between pet and livestock and they were so sweet about understanding of that. They examined each chicken for AN HOUR! So thorough! And it only cost $25!? I pretty much knew going in that both would need to be euthanized but they still discussed possibilities with me and did not act like it was ridiculous that I was bringing in a chicken. I really can't praise them enough for their compassion and competent treatment.,1

The office and exam rooms are always clean and the nurses are always pleasant & helpful. Especially, when I have to hold down my daughter for her shots. Great prices for office visits. Since I pay cash and have no insurance, it's a great place just in case you don't. Would recommend this office and Dr. Tenby.  And it's always very easy to get an appointment, even last minute.",1
103,"The wait staff couldn't seen to get anything right tonight.  Everything was slow. Our entrees appeared before our salads and they tried to convince us that this was normal. When the entrees returned at the correct time, they'd suffered from sitting under heat lamps. Drinks remained unfilled even when refills were requested. Dirty dishes sat in front of us long after we finished eating.... When I visited the restrooms, all the waste cans were overflowing and there was trash all over the floors.  It as no surprise then when they failed to bring our daughter her birthday dessert. We reminded them, but unlike the chocolate desserts that were served to the other birthday tables around us, our daughter was disappointed to receive lemon cookies. We won't be back.",0
104,"This place is amazing... had all of my pants hemmed here and they always did a fantastic job at VERY cheap prices. They knew me by name after a few visits, and even let me in a few times after closing. If I needed something back fast they were always accommodating. I even had a bridesmaid dress altered here and they did it for under $50 - can't complain at all!!!!",1
105,"I'm sad to have to write a negative review, we had high hopes for this place based on the other reviews.\nWe are new to this side of town, and tonight we were at our new house painting - none of our dishes are here yet so we figured why not get Chinese? So we ordered from Bobo - Mongolian beef with fried rice, 2 egg rolls and a wonton soup. \nIt came in about 40 minutes (a little slow, but the delivery guy was nice). When I opened the package up I was disappointed to find no spoon - I have no dishes so I can't eat my wonton soup. However, after looking at it, I didnt want to eat it anyway...it was super oily and had some kind of gross bright purple mystery meat in it (pork? Chicken? Something more sinister? Honestly I couldn't tell). My boyfriends Mongolian beef was okay, although not at all spicy like I had ordered. Fried rice was greasy and bland at best. \nSorry Bobo, you won't be our new Chinese takeout place:-(",0
106,"Never order Mexican with a slick facade.  Anyplace in a strip mall with Grandma back in the kitchen usually yields the gold.  This place, all hipster glitter and low rider bikes, needs to spend less time with the chrome and more time with the food.  I was underwhelmed by everything on the menu, even the guava Margarita.  Will not be going back.",0
107,OMG. this place is awful. i'm sorry..\n\nstraight to the point:\n\n- hot as hell inside. it's VEGAS turn up your AC. no one wants to eat pho in the heat. it was 104 degrees outside!!\n\n- slowest service ever. took forever to take our order took forever to bring out the food. \n\n- the noodles were still hard. YUCK\n\n- the only good thing about this place was the the beef was actually good.\n\nwon't ever come back here again!,0
108,"I gave this two stars because I will not go back. The only reason I didn't give it one star was because the food was edible and the service was ok. However, I want more than mediocre food for my money. We had the chicken taco combo and a green chile burrito enchilada style (was hoping for a tasty red sauce but it was a soupy green tasteless sauce).  We had the tomatillo sauce and the pico de gallo.   All of it, including the chips were bland. I had a  Stevia lemonade and my partner had a mango lemonade. Mine had too much Stevia in it and I am a BIG Stevia user. Partner's lemonade was so-so. Not much mango flavor and even the lemonade flavor didn't taste natural. Why pay $2.50 for lemonade from a mix? We don't feel a need to give them another try as we often do, because everything was consistently boring. Too bad because  I like to encourage places that serve healthy foods like whole wheat tortillas and brown rice.",0
109,"Before I review, I must say that for only going once, the impression left is very strong I very much recommend Su Vino. Before even talking about wine, the customer service focus is amazing. From all the Bridal Shows my fiance and I have been to, they are always so accommodating as far as costs for event rental and the way the owner handles business is great. I am currently in charge of our wedding rehearsal dinner/party, and this is the #1 spot I have set on my list. If we go through with it, it will be a blast. \n\n*As for our experience at the bar........*\n\nMy fiance and I went here on a Groupon about a year and a half ago. We haven't been back since. Its not our fault though, we've just been so busy.....sigh... Even without the Groupon, I would come by here, and we are planning on doing so shortly.  The wine tasting was great, and the platter we tried really added to wine pairing. Being a semi-wino, I enjoyed trying the varieties, while my fiance went right for the desert wines. Its nice to know they make in-house such a wide variety of wines for everyone to try,. \n\nConsidering the wines they make are privately made, and not \""""mass-produced\"""", the bottled wine to be purchased is also quite reasonable. The staff is friendly, and the ambiance of the location lends to a relaxing chill mood, rather than a fast paced guzzle-fest or a upper class snooty wine bar. We were able to play some fun board games while sipping on wines, and we stayed for a good couple hours just taking the location in and playing games. I can't wait to come back!!!!",1
110,"This is probably one of the most popular bars in Shadyside.  They have a  great wine bottle special, and decent (not great) prices otherwise.  The decor is really nice and posh...it kind of makes you want to put on a collared shirt.  The food is also decent, though not spectacular.  Definitely a nice lunch stopover though. \n\nThe problem with the bar is the crowd at night.  I mean it is CROWDED.  It's next to impossible to get a drink at the bar or from the wait staff, who are really trying their best but are just overwhelmed with people!   Drinks are made ok...I wasn't overly impressed.  I want to like the bar more, but the crowds keep annoying me to the point of wanting to leave.  Also, the bar is really packed with the douchiest people in Shadyside as well, so not only are you crowded into oblivion, but also it's like a Jersey Shore episode in there...not fun.  \n\nOverall, it's not a bad place.  The drinks and such are done ok, bue the crowd is just overwhelming at all times.  I'd go elsewhere if given the option.",0
111,"Have to agree with Chad here... the parking lot around this location is a nightmare.  The whole point of drive-thru is convenience, but when you have to weave around the parking lot to get in and out, there is something wrong.\n\nMost visits here are pretty quick... this last one was a long (insert expletive here) wait.  Luckily I wasn't in a rush, but you would think the employees should be... the guy running the food out to the parking space that I had to occupy while waiting just strolled up and then said, \""""Sorry for your wait\"""" in a mocking tone.  I was just glad that something finally came out...\n\nIt'll probably be a while before I try this McDonald's again.",0
112,"We had both lunch and dinner here Saturday as we were staying in the Marriott next door and it was so convenient.  Also, the lunch was good, making the dinner decision seem easier.  The Bistro Salad with Grilled Chicken was good at lunch; the earth didn't move, but it was pleasant and hit the spot.  My son liked his hamburger, my wife didn't complain about her sandwich.  But dinner.....  What is with waiters' and busboys' insane desire to grab every plate that is less than half full of food??  And when you have to interrupt your meal to say don't take that plate, I am still eating that food that you can see on it -- and when you have to do this at least TWICE!! -- I feel ashamed that I left a normal tip.\n\nWithout the decent lunch (later than normal time, so the restaurant was not crowded), this would be a one-star review.  My dinner entree of Mixed Grill was disappointing.  I guess I should have let those guys take it away!  The vegetable stir-fry was pathetic -- tasteless, undercooked, dullsville.  The filet chunks were fine and the mushrooms.... well, if I have to describe mushrooms, it could not have been a very inspiring dinner, could it?  The waitstaff needs a reeducation class.  But the buck should stop where it belongs, at the restaurant manager.  Get to work, buddy!  Think about your customers, not your dishwasher.",0

114,"I took a group of 11 to this Thai restaurant this last Sunday, January 15th around 6:30. We were all in the mood for Thai and since this restaurant was able to seat us we were happy.\n When we arrived at the table we were short a seat and asked for another one as there was an entire table in our area that didn't have a seat at it but it was connected to our row of tables. We waited 10 minutes for the seat while one of our the people in our group stood and talked to everyone. We then asked for another seat again and nothing came for another 5 minutes. We then just took a seat from another patrons table once they said they weren't using it.\n\n It turns out we were probably better off going to In and Out Burger. The food was \""""ok\"""" if you ignore the fact that they switched the spice on my dish and gave me 5 stars instead of one and my friend received no stars. After we covered my friends dish in hot sauce I asked for a replacement because they switched the spice. \n \n The waiter said he would, then asked if I would like some chicken dumplings while I waited and I said that would be great. I then didn't see the waiter for a bit. He finally came by and said he didn't bring my dumplings because I received tofu with my meal, he wasn't sure if I was a vegetarian. Except that I did say I would like chicken dumplings. After he walked away I then motioned for his attention and asked what else I could be compensated with since my meal was still not there and my party was almost done eating. He asked if I wanted a drink, I said yes then I waited 10 more minutes. I then asked the waiter where the drink was and he said he'd check on it. He found the drink at someone else's table. He then remade my drink and instead of a mojito I received an ice syrup drink that was disgusting.\n On top of all of this, my final meal was not all that great. \n\n\n Once we all put our cards in to pay for the waiter, I asked for change or to tell me if we were short cash. He already had an 18% gratuity on the bill. He then returned 5 minutes later and said we were square. I did the math and we were actually over $50 dollars of the owed bill. \n\n So, in the end here is what we experienced:\n\n1. Bad service\n2. Weak drinks\n3. Hard to find seating.\n4. Non-responsive staff\n5. Bland food\n6. Could not get the spice right\n7. Did not compensate for mistakes\n8. Overcharged and was dishonest",0
115,"I've been to several concerts at the Marquee over the last couple years, and it's always exciting being so close to the artists. It needs to make some improvements, the floor is always sticky and standing for hours is not always pleasant, but for the most part it's been a good experience for the price you pay. Especially considering that many big name artists play there, and seeing them in a bigger venue would cost double the price. The biggest issue that I have with the Marquee is that they charge $7 for parking, which is way too much.",1
116,"I was in Las Vegas last week and we were going to Jet and I guy yells out \""""Open Bar all Night at King Ink\"""" he gave us a wrist band and sent us on our way we figure we could drink there and then go to Jet. Well 1st they said $10 cover for females and $20 for guys then they tried saying $20 for both of us. I told them no the bouncer just told us 10 and 20. We get in there and they are blocking off all the seating and taking all the bar stools so there is nowhere for anyone to sit. Of course the open bar only consists of well drinks which is normal so that was ok. Being in stilletto heals, kinda wanted to sit so we went outside which again half the outside was blocked off and very little seating. They did have little space warmers which were nice beause it was really cold out. \n\nWe kind of felt cheated and looking around it seemed everyone else did too. It was basically a glorified tatoo parlor. It seemed like they wanted people to leave just to get their money through the cover charge. We decided to drink up and take advantage of the open bar. After a while of being in there it did get a little better music got a little more fun. I must have had a few more drinks.\n\nIf you want some real fun head over to JET!!!!",0

119,"This week I've been on the hunt for a pair of jeans that fit me well, as I seem to be in a weird body shape right now.  My boyfriend suggested I try the Curve line from Levi's.  Thankfully, this location has them.\n\nAfter I walked in, a gentleman employee came & of course saw the confused look on my face.  I explained to him my dilemma (which felt kinda weird talking to a man about my body shape, but I digress).  He whips out this measuring tape tool & began measuring me (again, felt a little uncomfortable, but we're both adults).  He exclaims \""""you're a demi curve or bold\"""".  So he walks me over to the stacks & stacks of jeans & begins pulling out 3 different sizes for me to try on.  This guy was VERY knowledgeable about these jeans & gave me all the details & perks on this line.  \n\nUnfortunately, after 8 different pairs in sizes & washes, I was rejected for every pair. Maybe this jean isn't made for my type?:D\n\nStill, the employee was not defeated. He said I should look on Levi's website for another fit (unfortunately) they don't carry in the store. \n\nThis gentleman, as well as the other employees here were very nice, helpful & friendly to me & the other customers.\n\nThe store is neat & organized - which is a plus to me, given it's a clothing & jean store.  The prices are reasonable too, signaling a TRUE outlet store.",0

127,"I was in Vegas last March for a wedding and one of the stops that I was fortunate enough to reach was the Bellagio's buffet!!\n\nMan, this place had E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G!  It had asian food, seafood, different meats, a dessert bar as big as the sushi bar, and a salad bar to top it off.  I'm a bit of a fattie when I find food I like and while my girlfriend and her parents finished at 2 plates.. I didn't satisfy my craving until 5.  I knew I wouldn't be coming back anytime soon so I had to get my fill of this place so I could savor the many flavors in my memories.

128,"AVOID!! AVOID!!  IF YOU WANT TO BE FOOD POISONED, GO HERE!! AVOID! AVOID!\n\nFirst of all the female manager is an absolute JERK!  She has an attitude of arrogance with a side of rudeness!! Wonderful combination!\n\nI've been going to Jamba Juice in ALL locations including California and have NEVER experienced ANYTHING like what I experienced here!\n\nEvery time I've ordered an extra boost of whey or soy protein and another \""""free boost\"""" they offer, IF the drink is made correctly and with the FULL INGREDIENTS, there is ALWAYS too much drink for the cup you ordered so the server automatically gives you the bigger cup to hold all the extra...

She REFUSED to place all of the drink in the larger cup. I have gone round and round with this manager moron at least 5-6 times AND obviously the \""""customer is always right\"""" doesn't apply here!  \n\nI finally got fed up and told her I went to the Jamba Juice on Gilbert / University and talked to them and they just shrugged, saying, \""""We always give the customer a bigger cup... they've paid extra, so we feel it's theirs. We don't quite understand why this manager is doing this, but that store is a separate franchise and are probably not following the Jamba Juice way.\""""\n\nI went back on Saturday and there the manager was at the cash register. When she saw me, she immediately turned and went to the back room and didn't come back. Another server had to come off the mixing line and as she walked to the cash register to help me, looked through the door window of the office (I could tell she was puzzled as to why the manager abruptly left).  I ordered and did my spiel about putting the extra in the larger cup and she nodded.\n\nAt the same time about 10 people came into the store and got in line to order and immediately the manager came out to wait on them... hmmm, I wonder if it is me?\n\nI watched the gal make my drink and she placed it into the mixer.  I turned away and looked out the window to check my son who was in the car and as I turned around, I saw the manager putting a scoop of white powder into my drink and then she started the mixer again.  I was STUNNED!!  I started to say, \""""What are you doing?\"""" and she immediately went back into the back room again.  I got really angry and said, \""""What is going on?... Why would she put that powder in my drink?  What is the powder substance?\"""" \n\nThe gal that waited on me stated she was going to find out & went into the back room and came out a minute later.  She said, \""""the manager said you always want whey protein and she saw that I put soy protein in you drink and made it wrong.\""""  I very agitated at this point, exclaimed, \""""So instead of making me a NEW drink, you sabotage my juice with TOO MUCH protein and make it taste like CRAP!!?!!\""""\n\nBy this time everyone in the place was just trying to figure out what was going on with this manager... I said in a very loud voice that I was leaving and I was going to contact the corporate offices as well as the HEALTH DEPARTMENT!!  Obviously I left WITHOUT my poisoned drink nor an offer of getting my money back!\n\nAt the very least this manager needs to be fired and have since learned that what she did with my drink can be a felony... how do I know what this white powder was that she put in my drink?

130,"As Mike K. said, Costco needs no description. Everyone knows what they and similar stores are like. What it does need is an argument for why you should have a club membership and why it's the best of the 3 major wholesale clubs. I for one, am convinced that absolutely everyone could benefit from a Costco membership.\n\nWHY CLUB MEMBERSHIP?\n1. As with all club stores, gas is 8-15 cents cheaper per gallon than local gas station. You'd be lucky to find it that cheap in SC.\n\n2. Make ONE big ticket purchase, be it new tires, a camera, TV, laptop, whatever, and you'll have saved enough to justify membership and then some!\n\n3. You don't have to be a family of 12 to make bulk food shopping economical. Meat freezes; canned/dry goods last ages; and last I checked, toilet paper doesn't expire. Besides, not everything is sold in gigantic quantities. Often it's just 2-3 regular sized items packaged together.\n\n4. You won't find cheaper beer anywhere. The selection may be limited. But for common brews, it's the way to go.\n\nWHY COSTCO?\n1. At the risk of stirring up sociopolitical controversy, Costco pays their employees - ALL OF THEM - a decent living wage, unlike some places that seem intent on keeping their serfs, um, I mean \""""associates\"""" in abject poverty and dependent on government assistance programs. And they do it while turning a profit in the billions, proving that their competitors are just greedy and exploitative. \n\n2. With the exception of Charlotte Regional Farmers Market, you won't find cheaper produce ANYWHERE! Red peppers, Brussels sprouts and asparagus are particularly noteworthy. And during summer, they're practically giving away raspberries and blackberries.\n\n3. Then there's the meat. Good god, the MEAT! Do I even need to spell out the benefits of getting it here? What they lack in variety they more than make up for in quality and price. Buy a giant slab of beef, pork, salmon, whatever, cut it into serving sized chunks, freeze them individually and you'll have meat/fish for weeks, if not months.",1
131,"Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!\n\nIt was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \n\nI stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \""""Are you working?\"""" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\n\nIn between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \n\nI was just really turned off from that experience. \n\nThe good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. \n\nIt's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it.",0

144,"Before getting started, I'd like to point out that I am currently sitting in the Palms Casino, while watching my degenerate, gambleholic, asshole-of-a-friend Pete grab his ankles, as the craps table continues to sodomize his life savings. The Palms Casino may as well be a priest, and with each roll of the dice, my man Pete is looking more and more like an alter boy. An alter boy with an ugly hat. As I look at this hat, I noticed a consistent theme. This hat of his will soon be joined by his pockets, as they both prevent the world from seeing what lies beneath -- nothing. What was once there, is now missing, and it isn't pretty. Nor was it smart. With just seven strands of hair, Pete has a face incapable of pulling off the 7-Strand comb-over. So money, combined with the freedom offered in Vegas to dive head-first into a hooker, was Pete's only hope to hump. Don't get me wrong, P never planned on returning to Phoenix with any money, which was fine, because that meant he wasn't bringing back his virginity either. Well, unless you count being molested by this casino. \n\nLet me start over. When I began writing this review, I was writing it for the Palms Place resort. I was only using my 6am-and-still-in-the-casino story to explain my exhaustion, and use it as a warning before transitioning into my review of our actual suite. However, as I continued to ramble, I realized that this has enough gems to be a review of its own. So let's jump back in. \n\nWith dick and pockets both dry, P refused to walk away from the action. But unlike his hair, my boredom started to grow, and soon left me balls deep in a conversation with some random Israeli gentleman who started our conversation by asking me if I gamble. It must have been the way I said, \""""Nope, never. Not at all,\"""" that convinced him I was interested in spending the next 30-minutes listening to him break down his formula for an 80% winning-percentage in roulette. \n\nLike all roulette conversations, this one also was followed up by literally dozens of questions on everything from Foreign Policy to soccer. I was pumped. Luckily, I was saved by irony. About midway through my optimistic response to the problem with America's public education system, I was interrupted by quite possibly the drunkest bitch I have ever seen. Clearly lacking intelligence, and a functioning metabolism, I couldn't deny her originality. Instead of some corny and cliche pickup line, this barefoot bitch thought outside of the box, and just spilled her drink on me. Luckily, it was about 7am, so of course she was double-fisting, enabling my shirt to get shit-faced. Before she could say a word, I stood, shook my man's hand, and announced that I had to go because I think my shirt had too much to drink and it needed to sober up. I think I confused her. Which made sense, because I don't even think she knew that she was carrying two drinks, let alone spilling them. I like to think that she stuck around and finished answering my new Israeli friend's question on education, which eventually led to her sitting on his trapper keeper (if you know what I'm saying), but who knows. Love is blind. As for me, I walked about twenty yards back to the table, just in time to see my buddy P go broke. It was perfect.",0

The salmon was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The ultimate flavor party came when I made little sandwiches from pita bread, salmon and rice. WOW. \n\nThis is great Mediterranean food.",1
147,"Ok I'm going to put this out there.  I haven't been to Marrakech for a while, but I feel they deserve a review.\n\nI loved the one time I was out.  I'm a student of Arab Dance myself, and went with another dancer friend of mine.\n\nWe had a blast.  \n\nThe food was delicious, and Aradia was dancing that night...she is a local treasure.  Second generation dancer, who has been dancing at Marrakech for years and years...she blew us away.\n\nI'd love to come back out again, sometime in the near future...I'm actually thinking about maybe coming for my birthday in March.  \n\nLove Marrakech!",1
148,"Shoddy, boring, inept.  For such a great property to serve such a lackluster Mothers Day brunch is a real disappointment.  No bagels (\""""well you can put some cream cheese on some toast or a roll\"""" said the manager).  Crab legs served frozen solid (we can put them in the steamer for you - another great idea from the manager).\n\nNo thanks.  I was hoping for it to served the way it was intended: refreshingly chilled.\n\nTo his credit he offered to pay our brunch tab.  That's okay, we're comped anyway.  What would have gone a long way is an admittance to being short on supplies, and not lame excuses.  This is the Mirage, after all - and not some off-the-strip hotel's breakfast bar.\n\n2 stars for excellent beverage service served up by a delightful lady.  The rest was as empty and void as the scrambled eggs - of which there were none as well.",0
149,"This place is a joke! I was in vegas with my friend and his family and we decided to get pizza. When I was trying to order, the employees kept messing around and paid no attention to us. After a long wait, we finally got our pizza. We started to dig in and my friends wife noticed there was, what appeared to be pubic hair, all over the pizza. I took it up to complain and the employee told me that it is what it is and went in the back and started making jokes about it with the other employees. We left disgusted and completely unsatisfied! I'll never be back there if that's the way they treat their customers!",0
150,"I can't even tell you how happy I was to see that Los Taquitos was finally opened in terminal 4 at Sky Harbor, so happy! I am a fan of their south Phoenix location. \n\nSo I checked out the menu board, didn't see anything that would catch my eye, but I was committed to giving them a try. I ordered a carne asada burrito and asked for extra salsa, even paid for it, order came out to 11 bucks, didn't even get a drink.\n\nMy order came out, let's start with the burrito, the tortilla was cold the meat had good flavor, but it was just carne & beans, that's it, no pico de gallo no guac, it was wrapped in a aluminum colored wrapping and came in a container with beans and rice, but the wrapped burrito was placed directly into the beans, so now that's a mess. \n \nThe beans were cool and so was the rice, it was like everything was made in a freezer house, oh and the extra salsa I had paid for, I had to ask for and the server gave a little tude because I question its whereabouts.\n\nI was thrilled to see Los Taquitos was coming into the airport, but now that I have been, I can't say I will be back.",0
151,"Got Bugs? No? Want Bugs? Yes? I have your place -- apparently. \n\nFirst, nice open space, modern but comfortable with a nice atmosphere that isn't too loud or too quiet. \n\nMost importantly, I don't eat bugs voluntarily. I know, call me odd, but it just isn't my thing. Up until my visit to The Parlor, not one single person had made me feel odd or unwarranted in my preference to avoid consuming bugs...ahhh, but all good things must come to an end, even our hopes and dreams of acceptance. \n\nSo, let's stick with the facts: The Smokey (a pizza) and another pizza we ordered were delivered to our table. I quickly noticed something moving on the arugula on top of the Smokey. I attempted to wave it away, thinking it was a fruit fly. My menacing wave had no impact and then I noticed that in fact there were at least 3 or more bugs moving about the arugula. With furious vengeance, I waved at them again. Nothing. OK, not eating this pizza. \n\nSo, I called the waiter over and told him that there were bugs on the pizza. Now this is where our story takes an odd turn (really, we probably have all found a bug in our food at some point, so that's not very odd). \n\nThe waiter responded -- \""""well, that's what happens when you don't use pesticides and the food is organic.\"""" He then called over another waiter and told her that there were bugs on our pizza. She inspected and concluded that it was so, whereupon she asked: \""""would you like something different?\"""" \n\nOK. Part of me was expecting the camera crew to emerge, but alas, Candid Camera has long since gone away and instead we were having a great moment in Phoenix restaurant service history. \n\nReally, \""""do we want something different?\"""" No no, now that we know that the bugs are organic, we will eat that pizza, and heck, order us another with extra bugs. \n\nAnd come on...\""""it's organic\""""...that's your response? -- I have organic vegetables delivered to me twice a month and I have never had any bugs (granted I do wash my produce). Also, my parents had a large garden when I was younger, no pesticides, and often there were bugs on the vegetables. But, and apparently this is a strange concept, we WASHED them off before eating or serving or storing. \n\nI understand, bugs happen. What I don't understand is the response we received. We truly felt like we were being odd for sending back the pizza. I know that the service level in Phoenix often hovers around a 3 to 4 out of 10, but really, this was a new low. I wasn't expecting the owner to come on out on his or her knees, but I did expect something along the lines of: Oh, I'm very sorry, let me take that away and get you a menu so you can select something else. \n\nSure, eventually there was a rather late \""""sorry\"""" and an offer of a free dessert, but it was a little late for that. \n\nOn the upside it made for great humor. When the waiter asked us if we had been there before I was half expecting, if we had both said no, she would have said, well that pizza always has bugs on it. And when she asked if we needed help picking something out, I really wanted to say: yes, something without bugs. Unfortunately, I kept the joke to myself. \n\nThe pizza we did eat was OK. The crust lacked flavor and overall it wasn't on par with the likes of Cibo, Humble Pie, or Bianco.\n\nI could get over the bugs, but I have a very hard time swallowing such terrible service. \n\n...wait, maybe there is a camera on me right now as I write this and Candid Camera really has come back...that's the best explanation I have.",0

153,"LOVE THIS PLACE! To start off.....It was my boyfriend's birthday and he's not one to like birthdays. Myself, being the event planner I am, wanted to make his birthday special and I wanted him to have an amazing time! So I got him a table at firehouse. \n\nWe get there, skipped the line and told the guy I had a table. He then called the manager over, Josh, and he SO kindly escorted us to our table and got us settled right in. He got me THE best table in the house over looking the whole club behind the bar! It was awesome!! Josh was so cool and consistently checked up on us. I don't know why some of the other reviews say he's rude cause he was SO nice and accommodating. At one point he even brought my whole party a round of shots on the house! Our cocktail waitress Robyn was even more awesome! She was the best host I've ever had at a table. Anything I needed she was there and on point. We had another girl there too but I cant remember her name. She was just as great and helpful. They made sure my boyfriend always had a drink in his hand. Oh and! we also had security at our table so randoms couldn't linger up in there. \n\nNeedless to say the night was awesome! I felt really well treated, the music was bumpin and my boyfriend had a GREAT time....success. I don't know why I don't do this every weekend?? It made me want to get a table every time I go there. \n\nThanks Firehouse!",1
154,"I was really looking forward to going there as a date spot, but a little disappointed for several reasons.  One, they're not open very late, and even 90 mins before close there was no one in there at all.  Two, maybe it was because they were blaring some awful 90's mix music conglomerate of Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys and Abba that did not exactly set the mood I was hoping for. Thirdly, Next you have to load $25 increments onto your card, which is fine but I think for spending $50 on wine (and we tried a few more expensive ones but mostly the cheapest ones) it's barely 1 full glass for each person. You'd have to spend a fortune here to even have a couple glasses each. Couple that with the fact that the dispensing machine malfunctioned twice in a row, charging my card $7 but not dispensing any wine, and it took the bartender almost 10 minutes each time to refund me, leaving us standing there wineless, alone, and listening to awful 90's music.  I was just disappointed because its a great idea but in reality didn't pan out to be that way.  I probably won't go here again on a date unless I find $100 I just can't wait to spend on 2 glasses of wine.",0
155,"I was so excited to drive along King Street and find this Farmer's Market. From the street it is so inviting and colorful! This market seems to attract a lot of people.\n\nI was very disappointed once I started looking more closely at the products. The market sells produce that you would find at a grocery store (perhaps slightly lower prices due to difference in overhead). I talked to one of the workers there and he said that they do not carry organic or local products (with the exception of some local Carolina strawberries that day). However, he said to check back in a month because they may start carrying some local types of products. \n\nI want to support local growers and sustainable practices by shopping at Farmers Markets. I do not plan on returning here when I can buy the same produce at a local grocery store. However, if you enjoy shopping outdoors and it encourages you to eat more fruits and veggies, this would be a nice experience.",0
156,"Apparently, under new management - FAIL!!!! Gas and inside store OK and friendly. Stay away from the unprofessional and lazy car wash area.

I paid to have car washed, inside and out. Been going there for about 4 years and expected excellent job as usual. Gave guy $5 tip and wasn't until I was driving down the road that I realized they never did the inside of the car.

158,"I'm only giving this one star because I can't give it less on the review site.  This is the WORST salon service I've ever gotten. I purchased a Groupon for a mani/pedi combo.  I went with a group of friends while we were on vacation in Vegas.  We weren't greeted at the door and no one offered us anything to drink at all. Weird for a salon. The woman doing the nails arrived late to the appointment for one of us, and then didn't know how to remove her gel nail polish. After she couldn't do it, she made my friend remove it herself. And at the end she tried to charge her an extra 10 dollars for it. While she was doing another of my friends nails she kept popping chocolate into her mouth. How unsanitary is that? Gross. She finally told us we could help ourselves to their awesome espresso machine but it was two dollars, and if we wanted soda, it'd also cost us. First time someone at a salon has ever tried to charge me for a drink. Well, after she was done stuffing her face with bon bons she got around to actually doing my friends nails. She told us we couldn't do boring colors because it wasn't \""""VEGAS\"""" enough. Um, last time I checked, WE were paying YOU for the SERVICE. Not your decision. My friend had a hangnail and the bon-bon tech lady decided to put superglue on it, but she didn't want to stick a pin in the top of the superglue spout to clear it out because she \""""didn't want to hurt herself\"""" so she made one of us do it. Classy. Then she stuck superglue all over my friends cuticle, which she spent the rest of the night removing. During the pedicure portion for my friend, she actually made her legs bleed with the scrubbing she did. Yikes. And when my friend told her she'd bought a dress for a grey dress for a night out, the bon-bon lady told her that grey is an ugly color. Professional all the way. When one of my friends complimented my purse the bon-bon lady said \""""That's a grandma purse\"""". Excuse me? Who asked you? My appointment with her started half an hour late. She cut my cuticles so bad that one of my fingers bled the rest of the night. I didn't even get the full pedicure because we didn't have time because we had tickets to see a show that night, which we weren't able to make on time anyway. \n\nSome other fun things from our posare salon visit: Bon-bon lady kept answering her phone during our nail services.  Complained that her son, though really, really good-looking, kept bringing home \""""one fat girl after another\"""". Bon-bon lady wasn't exactly supermodel weight herself... The equipment wasnt nice either. The pedicure chairs were old and dirty and the manicure tables looked like they needed a good wipe down with a disinfectant.\n\nTo sum it up, this was the absolute worst experience I've ever had at a salon. SuperCuts is classier than this place was. This place needs Tabatha Coffey to visit it, because that's the only way I'd EVER visit it again.",0
159,"When did customer service die? I have no idea but it does not exist here. I had an interview in Ballentyne and I had some downtime between appointments. I went here to do a little work on my laptop and enjoy a light lunch. I waited until well after the lunch rush around 2 PM. Since I was there on my own, I sat in the bar area. \n\nMy order was not terribly complicated. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and turkey chili combo. My food arrived after a moderate wait and looked appetizing. The grilled cheese sandwich was well prepared but the turkey chili was repulsive. Think about Hormel chili being dumped out of a can and then over seasoned to the point that it was inedible and you have an idea of how bad this was. \n\nThe problem was worsened by the fact  that my server did not check back on me once during the entire meal. My tea was never refilled and nobody came by to ask \""""How is your meal?\"""" which is generally considered to be Restaurant 101. My server seemed to be more focused on chatting with friends and doing her side work so that she could punch out on time. \n\nWhen someone arrived after the meal was clearly finished, she finally asked if everything was ok. I told her that the chili was inedible. It was clear that I had only taken one bite and then pushed it aside. She apologized and then brought the check which included a charge for the uneaten chili. I had an appointment scheduled and decided that $5 worth of chili was not worth dealing with drama. I paid the check and left. At least I know a restaurant to avoid the next time I am in Charlotte, NC.",0
160,"Old Chicago is the furthest thing from good. \n\nFor starters, a group and I dined here on a slow Thursday before going to the movies. I order a very simple appetizer. Tomatoes and Mozzarella Caperes (not sure of the name). Anyway, all there is to it was tomatoes slices, with mozz cheese slices on top topped with spinach and balsamic vinegar. How can you mess up something so simple? I know! You served all of the ingredients very unfresh to diners. My tomatoes seemed to have been a day old as well as the spinach. Because of that, I wasn't sure if I should finish eating the cheese from fear of getting sick. It wasn't a good meal at all. Extremely disappointing. \n\nFor my meal, I was craving a sandwich. I order a turkey and bacon club - minus the bacon because I do not eat pork.  The sandwich was OK but the bread was so hard it cut my gums every time I bit into it. The bread is toasted but they let mines toast far too long. At least the fries were better. I think the sandwich ending up being $10 and it wasn't worth half of that price. \n\nOld Chicago is far too expensive of a restaurant to serve bland food. How they are still open is beyond me. I won't be returning. This was my third trip here and none of them were good.",0

163,"Ah T.C. Eggington's...I wish your brunch lines weren't such a feat of strength. If you're going on the weekend, be prepared to wait. \n\nThis is a cute spot in a nondescript shopping center that is home to a Boot Barn and a few of your typical commercial center shops. You'll know where T.C. is by the line of people anxiously waiting to get their bacon and egg on in various stages of \""""ohmygodhowlonghavewebeenwaiting.\""""\n\nThe menu is a fun mix of omelettes, egg creations, pancakes, waffles and lunch. Honestly, I've only glanced once at the lunch menu because I mean well..it's an egg place. I came for the eggs.\n\nThey have really good housemade jams that are on the table and ready to be slathered on their homemade english muffins which will put those store bought kind to shame. They come slightly buttered and are just a little crisp around the edges. They're very light and not spongey like the ones that come in a plastic bag at the market.\n\nMy favorite omelette is the o'pear grenache a mixture of pears, sliced almonds and Havarti. I know, who puts pears in an omelette? But it's one of those weirdly delicious flavor combinations that you would never put together yourself. \n\nThe beverages are solid-I've enjoyed every cup of coffee and juice that I've had here and they now offer adult beverages which is a rich reward for what is often a long wait.\n\nThe service is friendly and attentive, even during the busiest hours and the wait staff wears old timey button down and khaki numbers that really just have to be seen to be believed (and understood). I think crazy socks are part of the uniform too because I've never seen an average pair in the times that I've dined there and believe me, I've looked.\n\nDespite the wait this is a consistently good brunch option that I will continue to wait for!",1
164,"This is a short review because we did not even get to eat here. Our group of 12 made a reservation to go have a nice dinner for one of our friends birthdays. When we got there the place looked nice and had a very large beer selection, so I was a fan.\n\nBUT.......since the vast majority of our group was there on business the check needed to be split so receipts could be turned in. There were a few couples there, so I think we needed it split 8 ways. We were told that they could only use 3 different card and that the tables could not be split. Our group was sitting at 3 four tops put together, and a long bench seat on one side. I feel like it would have been very easy to split us and still keep us all seated next to each other due to the bench seat.\n\nI understand that rules/policies are what they are and are put in place for a reason. However, I think this policy may have been put in place for smaller orders or groups, and it may have been smart for our server to check with a manager before having a group of 12 just walk out the door.\n\nUnfortunately we were forced to walk out without getting to try, what seemed to be a nice restaurant.",0

168,"Been a local supporter of this business since 2007. Have seen it grow through the years. Happy to see the owners are doing well enough to expand, sad to see the lack of employee happiness-they all look miserable to work there, and the big guy making pizza on Friday and Saturday needs to be cross trained on how to work the paging system when he puts out pizza. We ordered our pizza at 8:12, and didn't get it till 9pm because the guy didn't page. Just let it sit there and get cold. After 15 -20 minutes of doing nothing with it, he set it under heat lamps in the kitchen while he closed the pizza line down.  Starving, I finally went up and asked the cashier. All she said was \"""" your pizza isn't out yet? That's weird.\"""" Greatest guest service ever.  I asked another lady closing the gelato down, and she said \""""here's a pizza in the window, it must be yours.\"""" No apology-nothing. \""""We have been having trouble with our pagers from time to time.\"""" No lady, your pizza maker is working with half a brain!

170,"Update: I asked for my medical records and guess what?  Both incomplete and inaccurate!  Surprise!  They didn't do full intake on me during my multiple visits so just \""""copied\"""" what was there.

I called May 6th to reschedule it from tomorrow to another day but forgot to write down the new day.

Perhaps Dr. Ashman doesn't realize that before you get a divorce you have to get married and because I NEVER saw him because he walked out on me, kind of hard to get a divorce.... but I did refuse his proposal that I wait longer than the 40 minutes I had already been there because I had my cell phone in my hand when he finally walked in the room.\n\nBTW...when I was in the elevator going down after I left Ashman's office I was grumbling and someone in scrubs asked me what was up.  I said I was waiting for a doc that was 40 minutes late and he got mad because I had my cell phone in my hand (not talking, just checking work e-mails, etc since the wait was so long.... and I told him Ashman walked out and I walked out on him a few minutes later)  Reply for the guy in scrubs?  \""""Good for you.  He treats everyone that way\""""\n\nJust as an FYI, when I saw another doctor for another joint, he was well over an hour late and while he wasn't overtly rude, the rest of the staff had gone home and he clearly wanted to as well so I got the bums rush with a quick referral to MRI)\n\nIt seems to me that if this place cared about their patients, they might want to look about their process that makes patients wait so long, see so many doctors and allows doctors to be so overtly rude.  Any other place would have FIRED an employee for being such a rotten egg.  MD or not if you hate your job so much and hate people so much... time to look for another job!",0
171,"This place is supposedly owned by the same people that own Sapporo. Or maybe it was and isn't now, I don't know. What I do know is that we have been there many times and the one constant is the shiiiiiiiitttttty service. Here's an anecdote: \n\nThree friends and I went to Ten to get some sushi. We ordered sushi. My little deal is I like to order spicy tuna rolls but--get this--add avocado. Because avocado is good. The couple with me orders a spicy salmon roll, which ordinarily comes with avocado--except that they didn't want the avo. So, among other things, we should be receiving spicy tuna rolls *with* avocado and spicy salmon rolls *without* avocado. Backwards, yes. \n\nWell of course I wouldn't be writing this if that's what had arrived. No, alas, we got our rolls but sans modifiers, i.e. spicy salmon with and spicy tuna without avocado. So I politely pointed this out to the waiter. The appropriate response would be: O. M. G. I'm so sorry--be right back with the correct order. Nope. The waiter looks at the rolls and then goes to check with the sushi chef. He returns and tells us (!) that the rolls are actually correct: that salmon colored roll is indeed tuna, and the tuna colored roll is, in fact, salmon. When confronted with the issue of salmon colored ties (not to mention half of Craig Sager's wardrobe) being named after the wrong goddamned fish, the waiter could only muster a vacant stare and offered to talk to the manager. TALK TO THE MANAGER? \n\nSo the manager comes and reiterates: yes, that is indeed tuna. \""""The one colored like salmon?\"""" Yes. \""""And the tuna colored one?\"""" Salmon. Ah. \""""Would it matter to you if I told you that I ate the 'tuna' roll and it tasted conspicuously salmony?\"""" No, that is indeed tuna. We add to our tuna (insert name of some made up, nonexistent spice that turns tuna salmon color and vice-versa) and that makes it look that way. \n\nNow I'm making this story drag, I admit. But the concept of someone so brazenly lying to me (or just being plain fucking stupid) is highly irritating to me. If it weren't, I'd watch fox news. But no, the manager and waiter all stuck to their story. What I should have done is played along and ordered a spicy \""""salmon\"""" roll, complete with avocado. But I was too pissed to do that, and so instead I argued with the manager and embarrassed my friends. Sorry all. \n\nMoral of the story: Ten has mediocre food and fucking dipshits working the sushi bar. If you trust these mensas with raw fish that you're about to eat, go ahead. Otherwise I recommend Celsius or Shogun. (reviews to come, maybe.)",0

The bouncer told him that he'd seen the same ID pass through earlier already. Again, WTF!! are you kidding me? They asked our friend to sign his signature like a couple times and kept rejecting it saying that his hand writing was not even close compared to what he had on his ID. Finally we got tired of all the BS and most of my friends just left. I, on the other hand still tried to get in because I was supposed to meet my cousin. So I spoke to the \""""manager\"""" and he let me and my bff get in line. Thinking it was for the VIP guest list, I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. Well 20 mins. passed and still waiting in line, I decided to ask what the matter was. Turns out we still had to pay cover! After realizing this, we finally decided to jet! \n\nAnother thing about that club is that they are so unorganized! They had like 5 different lines all going on at once. Aside from the short line we were in (the reason why I thought it was guest list), there was another general line waiting to go in. Oh and the promoters up front kept running around like crazy. Like they had the worst form of communication. All in all it was just so ridiculous and such a hassle. They think their club is too good, well if you keep treating people that way no one would want to go there. There are so many hotter clubs in Vegas. PUHLEEAZE!",0

He looks like he'll dance.\""""\n\""""No. I'm scared...\""""\n\nOut of all the guys there, we found one that stuck out, but we were too wimpy to get him to dance. Epic fail. =(\n\nThis place is a lot less crowded than Tao and the music is just as good, with 3 seperate rooms for the folks with different taste. The main dance floor is mainstream hiphop and a bit of house mix. A few repeats here and there, but it got me goin.\n\nEvery so often, the cocktails waitresses will walk by with mixed shots for \""""free\"""". Free, meaning take a shot for a tip. I think that's clever and a lot cheaper than buying at the bar. The shots are usually girly drinks though, like Sex On The Beach or Hurricanes.\n\nOh, and did anyone call for a stripper pole??

176,"So first thing this gal could think of after completing the RNR half marathon here in Vegas is a tasty burger and beer!!Located in the Venetian, I was staying at the adjoining Palazzo, Public House was a mighty fine choice!!\nI ordered the pub burger and a Hoeegarteen to drink. The burger was so delicious and flavorful! My stomach was extremely happy! A lively crowd, I also enjoyed talking to the bartender and several British patrons as well!!",1
177,"never again!! Sat. morning took my daughter to breakfast there. she had 2 breakfast burritos &.a hash brown. We sat down inside\nthe second burrito had a bug on it the kind with the pincher at the end so I took it to the cashier asked for the manager I show it to him with a confused look. he then showed it to i'm assuming she was the owner plain clothes behind the counter Asian lady. listen to this excuse it blew my mind she said that it must have flown on the burrito I told her there is no wings,then she says it can't be from us because everything is brought in frozen and if it was from them the bug would be dead!

178,"I'm still blown away by this awful person named Gary. Who does he think he is...? Please respond Gary, please. I, like everyone else (except for Jennifer b of course) had the exact same experience. If you ever gave this Gary guy your hard earned money I am sorry for you loss. I would guess you most likely contributed to his drug habit which clearly makes him one unbearable human being. He is by far the worst person I've ever encountered in customer service. If that's what he even calls it. Which I highly doubt. Gary if I were you id probably quit while I was ahead. You suck.",0
179,"I have literally cried over this meal 3 times in the past 24 hours. Maybe a little dramatic, but I had huge expectations. I may very well be Gordon's biggest fan. When I was planning my October vacation I specifically chose Vegas just so that I could have dinner here! To say that it was a let down is a huge understatement. \n\nWhen we arrived I was blown away by the entrance and the decor of the restaurant. It's beautiful! We sat at the bar for a drink and then were escorted to our table upstairs. I should note that I made reservations several months in advance. They really do fill up, so know that planning well in advance is necessary here. \n\nI knew it would be a long relaxing dinner. I was excited for the whole experience. This was just slow though. We sat at the table a good 15 minutes before anyone approached us. I was dying of thirst! Don't get me wrong, our server was wonderful. I just feel like they have things set up for the meal to last at least 3 hours. I was falling asleep at the table. \n\nThe presentation of the steaks is really cool. I've never seen anything like it. My mind was made up months ago though. I knew I was getting his signature beef wellington. It would be a decision I would live to regret. \n\nI started with the onion soup. It was really good, but not hot! I got the feeling it was not served to me right away. It was almost as cool as room temperature. My friends soups/salads were served perfectly though. The salads looked to be the way to go. \n\nThe beef wellington was awful! I ate about 25% of it and then threw in the towel. I guess I'm just not a fan of the baked meat? It was tender but I just couldn't get over the off taste of it. It literally tasted like I came home from work and threw a piece of meat in my oven. The pastry fell apart and didn't stay on the meat. I'm not sure how it's supposed to be though. I just sat there wishing I had grabbed a slice of pizza for dinner instead. \n\nWe did a side of saut\u00e9ed spinach and the brussel sprouts. Both were good. Those are hard to screw up though. I do regret not trying the Mac and cheese. That sounded good. \n\nI had been looking forward to dessert here for months! Timing was an issue on this one though. By the time we were offered dessert we were ready for bed! No joke. I couldn't keep my eyes open. We had a cup of coffee attempting to gain some energy back, but threw in the towel and went to bed. \n\nIn the end I received over a $400 bill for a dinner I didn't enjoy. The staff is friendly and all had wonderful personalities. At least I have that memory. I won't be making the mistake of ever going back.",0
180,"Warning for anyone in a wheelchair who wants to eat here.......... \n\nI didn't get a chance to eat here because they ran out of the normal, lower dining tables and only had seating at the bar or one of those high top / bar tables. This is NOT good for a person in a wheelchair like myself. I was informed by a hostess that a month ago management decided to remove 1/2 of the dining tables and replace them with the high tops... thus becoming way less wheelchair friendly. I don't want to eat when I can't see my food because the plate would be at eye level or worse depending on the height of one's wheelchair. This is just WRONG. \n\nFor just drinking purposes, I suppose it would do. \nBut, I definitely think they need to do something about this little bit of discrimination and use a little common sense. How can I eat from a high top table when I can barely see what I would be eating? I'd get more ON me than IN me.\n\nI was really looking forward to eating at this place too.\n\nEdited to add: I'm not sure why people are finding this issue FUNNY.",0
181,"Way over rated! 1 21oz. beer, order of garlic fries, onion rings, & 2 burgers will cost you $45.00, not including the tip! Red Robin has great burgers & fast service. If I'm going to spend that kind of money, then I may as well go out for a steak dinner & add a few more bills in my wallet! The music playing is some type of new age trance music, it was very annoying. We had a 25 min. wait to eat on a Sat. afternoon at 1:15 p.m.! Why all the hype? I guess because they were on the food channel.",0
182,"Meh. It's so close to my uni that I come here often but it's just... so... meh. I agree with Jenny over  here that it's absolutely soulless.\n\nOften times you'll sit down and the waitress will actually forget that you're there -while you're sitting in the middle of the restaurant in front of three of 'em standing around chatting-. Alzheimer Light? Or I-don't-give-a-shit-about-my-crappy-job. I'm guessing the latter.\n\nLook, if it's between Nero in Blackwells and Biblos, I'll choose Biblos because, well, their seats are comfier, and that's the only reason, but in all fairness, it's quite.. bad.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I should stop coming here altogether. It's just so... convenient, damn you Biblos.\n\nLook if you want a good burger and fries, skip Biblos and head up the street to Mums, and if you want a good coffee, the cafe across the road from them -though smaller- serves far better brew, but if you don't care and just want to be left alone, sit in at Biblos, I promise you, it will be quite... forgettable.",0
183,"Not much has changed at Patties, I'm sorry to report. \n\nWhat has is that they upgraded the TVs! The place is still filthy and reminds one of a bad frat house or a Gila Bend bar, as some have mentioned. It's the dive of dive bars that I have been in through out my USA and Canadian travels. Oh it's no longer cheap to to drink there and they do now have glassware not just plastic cups for your drinks, so that has changed. \n\nThe barkeeper, is an old guy who has been there past his prime. There are photos of him among photos of the crowds on a board where he looks 15 years younger. By now he has no personality and patience for the drinking crowd and this was at the start of Happy Hour on a Tuesday! The way he throws together a mixed drink or offers up the beer/wine list you can tell he just doesn't care anymore. It's pretty awful and sad at the same time. \n\nOne day a week ( I forget which) according to the flier on the wall they offer up a patty (aka burger) night. No other food is served here and how they get the OK to serve on that night from the health board is a mystery. Maybe the pull out a grill into the parking lot, is my best guess. \n\nThe jukebox is a newer version of the equipment, but I didn't stick around to hear it. A regular, some creepy skinny dude said he was going to play it, but warned me no one wold like what he played. I took him at his word. \n\nThe place has a few hundred dollars of mostly US $1 bills stuck on the walls and ceiling in the area close to the bar. They have words, names and comments boldly inked on them. The barkeeper was busy stapling a few recent ones to the wall. He commented to another customer when asked, that he doesn't read them, ever! because only the drunk write and leave them. My what an attitude for one in the drinking& hospitality business! \n\nAmong those mostly dirty and yellowing from nicotine bills you will see a sign near the old gold register handwritten selling \""""All Cigarettes are $10\""""! Holy Moley and I don't smoke! But apparently many of the patrons do, because the building is split down the center leaving the place open to the sky and elements, which apparently allows them to forgo the nonsmoking ordinances now in effect for establishments. So many freely light up and smoke in the center of the floor/building. \n\nOut of sheer curiosity, on my why out I opened the the women's room door. Eeewwe, the place recked like a bad outhouse, though it had a nice white new pedestal sink and commode, but their was no way I could stomach the room to even primp in the mirror!\n\nI did manage to take a picture at the bar to give you a glimpse of the place. Hopefully it will help you check the stop off your list. Oh and one other thing, I wish bar owners would not publish their political views with bumper stickers in ther establishment - put it on your car or not post it.",0
184,"So me and some  friend went to this I hop today. I have the worst service I have ever had in my life. My friend had to wait about 20 more minutes for his food to come while we had ours ready. I had to remind the waiter that there was still an order missing. He brought it right away so we could tell it had been ready all along. He just forgot it. He didn't ask my other friend what kind of sauce she would like for her chicken. He didn't bring us syrup for our pancakes until much later. It felt like he wasn't all there. The wrost thing that happened was he didn't let us pay at the front so we could all split our tabs. Because of this,  he confused our payments and i ended up paying more than i should have. He was unprofessional and seemed like it was his first day at the job. I think he shouldve comped one of the meals to make up for the mistakes. Me and my friends are not satisfied with that waiter and it has made us not want to go to that location anymore.",0
185,"There are two locations! We went to the one in Laval, which is a short drive on the highway from downtown montreal. \n\nCame here for a bachelor party on a Friday afternoon. There was a lot of down time between events (took about 2 hours to finish a go-karting package that was three fifteen minute races) because the place was so busy. The karts had good speed, and the staff were quick to help people who were stuck along the walls. The paintball area probably had too many large places to hide behind. I would personally prefer a few smaller obstacles to encourage movement and not just camping. The ground was also completely wet--it was like playing in a swamp, but I guess it's tough to maintain an indoor field. All said, we had a good time.",1
186,"Oyster Bar combo pan roast, $24.  A  discordant mish mash of spiced up odds and ends with about 4 big shrimps thrown in.   I don't get it?  What's so great?

187,"It's very hard to trust Drai's promoters now. My group of girls got approached while we were walking on the strip by a promoter named Calvin Coolidge, who claimed to get us \""""two tables, 3 bottles of vodka, 2 bottles of champagne\"""" for free. Thinking that it was too good to be true, I talked back and forth with the promoter through text trying to figure out if their offer was legit. Everything went smoothly (communication, getting into the club, being on the guestlist) until we actually got inside. He told us that he would meet us by the bar, but kept us waiting for an hour. He kept saying things like \""""I'm coming up, be there in a sec, my manager won't let me in.\""""\n\nI'm sorry but, please don't make promises if you can't pull through. You're wasting everyone's time. The whole process was very unprofessional. \n\nOne star for the complimentary drink ticket and spacious dance floor.",0
188,"So...I tried it again....still not amazing. It's not terrible food, just not great. \n\nThis past Sunday I went to the Coach House to watch the niners game. My friends and I drove up there and parked in the dirt parking lot which is connected to the Coach parking lot. My girlfriend and her friend went over the Taco shop and got some tacos and a burrito to go. We then all went into the Coach and enjoyed the game. A few hours later we went to get into our car and it was gone. Apparently America's Taco Shop had all the cars towed. The tacos here are not worth the $75 towing charge. I was a patron at this establishment and will NEVER go back. I am glad to see that other people on here had the same issue and are voicing their anger as well. \n\nAmerica's Taco Company has made a fatal mistake. They should have put flyers on the cars warning people of the issue, not just had them towed. It could have been a great way for them to advertise their new location. Put a flyer on the cars that offers a free taco or something. Not everyone knows about this new place. Instead they decided to piss people off. They need to be careful who they piss off. The Coach House brings them a lot of business which will now be greatly diminished due to this. I used to tell people to just walk behind the bar and grab a taco. I will no longer be doing this. \n\nI do NOT recommend going to this place. \n\nGood Luck America's Taco Shop!",0
189,"Umm.  What are these \""""hippies\"""" smoking?\n\nI only ask because:\na) this isn't a 60s-ish place.  Just because you calling your appetizers \""""munchies\"""" (I get it!  Like I'm stoned!) and you have a psychadelic menu cover doth not make a hippie place.    This was like the bastard lovechild of TGI Friday's and a 5 and Diner.\nb) This is some of the heaviest pizza I've ever had.  And not in a good way (like traditional Chicago pie).  You'd better like crust because you get a ton of it.  We did a cheese and a BBQ chicken. \nc) Tomato bisque soup is not bisquey.  My wife thought it tasted like tomato sauce.  When she sent it back, the server guessed right \""""Did you think it tasted like red sauce?\""""  Apparently we weren't the first.  That ain't a good sign, friends.\nd) It isn't cheap.  You want good, cheap hippie food?  Go to Two Hippies Beach Stand @ 5th and Camelback.\ne) Where's the peace on Earth?  It is loud.  We got sat in the back (near the kitchen) which was better.. but up front?   Find me an eating experience where loud helps your experience.  I never notice the noise levels in restaurants.  This was madness.\n\nOn the plus side, there are a lot of beers.  They are expensive but it looks like a great deal at happy hour (which is 2-6 M-F).  \n\nNorthsiders, don't let the convenience trick yourselves into thinking this is good pizza.  You're better than this!",0
190,"Came here as a party of 4 on Christmas Eve - we had a reservation, but the place was jammed packed so I was unsure of the wait, despite having a reservation. We checked in and were taken immediately to a table. Our server was excellent, we never had an empty class. The food was wonderful, not a long wait for it to come out and just an overall great experience. 5 stars for excellent customer service and tasty food!",1
191,"I met a bunch of friends here for dinner and while the company was great, chain or otherwise, the food was blah. First, we had to practically beg them to take a reservation for ten, which they sort of honored. At least there were a few free tables they were able to push together when we arrived.\n\nOur waitress was the only shining star - she did a good job of taking care of 9 people with 7 separate checks and she kept the drinks refilled. She was also helpful in getting a couple of the TV's switched over to the Panthers game (they lost).\n\nWe had a few appetizers for the table. The pretzel \""""bones\"""" were good, served with a couple of different sauces, as were the onion rings with their dipping sauces. If you like cheese fries, try the Fire Stix which were the best part of the meal.\n\nHaving read the reviews, I knew to stay away from the brisket. I went with a \""""lunch\"""" sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast. It was dry and not much more than warm. After we asked, the waitress brought out the bbq sauces, which improved the bland taste. The \""""fire roasted corn\"""" was good - a corn and red pepper medley that was tasty. The mashed potatoes with gravy were good as well, especially when I mixed it with the corn.;-) Both sides were too small and my friend sitting next to me got an even smaller undersized scoop of potatoes with his salmon.\n\nWe didn't have dessert. They added 18% gratuity to the check, which was understandable for the size of our group.\n\nWould I go back? No, I don't think so.",0

193,"Pretty happy with my first meal of the year in 2015. The family and I decided to hit up the new Town Square BBQ joint called Pot Liquor. I was thrilled when there wasn't a huge crowd for the holiday. It smelled delicious upon entry, and my expectations were pretty high. \nThere was a beautiful chandelier made from musical instruments that was a perfect decor for the atmosphere they were going for. Jazzy, blues, Bbq, bar yet family style type of place. The staff was friendly, and seemed to already have regular customers as they recognized numerous guests. \nMy family ordered three appetizers; pork rinds, deviled eggs, and burnt ends. The deviled eggs came with a chicken skin crisp crumble over the top and added a spectacular crunch. The pork rinds were basic but good. And the burnt ends were the first thing gone on the table. We were also presented a sauce sampler with four different styles of sauce to pair with your meat. The first, a sweet classic barbeque sauce. The second was similar to the first, but more spicy than sweet. I would have preferred more spice actually. The third was a cider vinegar they suggest you try with pork. I enjoyed it, the vinegar was not too overwhelming. And then my personal favorite, the white sauce. They describe this as, mayo, horseradish, and seasonings. Don't pass up on the random white sauce, its freakin' great! \nFor our entree we went with a Lord Have Mercy platter. The waitress insisted that with all this meat, between the four of us, we would most likely have leftovers. (Note: myself, my bf, our kids ages 17 & 12) The entree included:  1/2 smoked chicken, 6 baby back ribs, 6 dry rubbed spareribs, Carolina pulled pork, 4 Louisiana hot links and three sides. Let's just say, we were stuffed, yet our waitress was indeed impressed. Everything had a real smoked flavor. No shortcuts used with this BBQ. \nI also got an order of the breakfast brisket hash, because for $20 it came with unlimited Bloody Mary's, so that was a deal in itself! This is usually a weekend brunch special, but they were offering it because of the holiday. The bloody was great, I had 3 of them, and was feeling it towards the end. \nDon't ask me how we ate dessert, but we did. I felt like a family of food critics trying everything on the menu, the kids did great. We had the deep fried banana split (huge and awesome) and the strawberry shortcake sandwiches. Just get those, don't even ask, just do it. \nDuring our meal, the general manager Francis stopped by our table to ensure satisfaction. Although he was a Cowboys fan, we set aside our football differences and he gave us a coupon for 10% off, that we were able to use that day. The waitress even let us keep the coupon, which is cool because we totally will be returning to this place.",1

195,"I'm no Indian food expert but you can stamp my Indian food non-expert seal of approval for Mount Everest. It is an All You Can Eat Indian buffet with all sorts of Indian dishes for just $10.99.  Believe me when this very reasonable price of $10.99 is worth way more than the price you pay. Each time I've been here for lunch it's been packed with people spilling out while waiting for tables to free up.  There's even not a lot of parking.  Most of the time these are good signs of how delicious a place is and this was the case here. Is it authentic Indian? I wouldn't know but a few of my vo-workers from India like them too, though I haven't seen others from India dine here at the same time as me.\n\nI never asked what a dish was or what's inside so all I can say is that I enjoyed them all, the green stuff, the orange stuff, the yellow and brown stuff, the stuffed bread stuff, and the fried battered stuff, all very delicious. They were labeled but I don't remember what each was because I usually sample them all. There was a red chicken, not to be mistaken for char sui, and another meat dish. Ask for the Garlic Naan, the freshest right out of the oven?? the better.  They do have non-buffet options.\n\nIt use to be a Burger King so imagine that kind of space on the inside and they have a TV playing films from India. Customer service is usually fast and friendly so the only reason that I think there's a long wait is because they are very good and those there first are enjoying the goods.",1

When I got the sandwich (number 11) it only had TWO Slices of meat and a tons of carrots. This place has gone to the dumps the only thing health about this place is your jaw gets a workout from chewing the hard French bread! I'd rather go to subway and I hate subway.

206,"Given the proximity to other very similar restaurants on this block, pick the other restaurants over this one.  Owned by the kids of Kabul (across the street), Maza is just a mediocre version of Kabul and only $1-3 cheaper.  The service was terrible (though I went only a month or two after it opened, so that may have improved), they charge for a very small amount of bread, which is a bummer when you have a larger group of people, and the food is pretty average.  If you are in the mood for this kind of food, go across the street to Kabul where the food is reliably very delicious.",0
207,"What is a winesky? \n\nI'm so very glad that you asked. A winesky is a cocktail containing the happy marriage between Coach House's finest cabernet and whisky from the deepest well in all of  Scottsdale. Conceived from the mind of my favorite genius bartender, Drew, a winesky is an all out assault on your senses, and if you have one too many of them, you will surely be ass-over-tea-kettle in no time flat.\n\nCoach house is the best bar in Scottsdale. Hands down. (DJs was a close second) I generally come here with Rabbi Andrew Michael Doohan III. If it is a proper night, we will stroll in sideways at 12:00 am on the dot, and our standard order is two shots of whisky and a pitcher of Bud Light. Often, if Drew is working, he will line our order up as soon as the Rabbi and I walk in the door. He knows us a little too well, perhaps. \n\n$13 for the first round. Well shots(including wineskys) are generally $3.50. Full pitchers are $6 or $6.50(domestic, of course).\n\nI love the other bartenders too, although some of them overcharge on occasion, and they don't necessarily get my jokes.....\n\nChristmas lights from November-February. Free Barbecue every Giants home game during Spring Training, and almost every Sunday for the rest of the year.",1
208,"I go to this store occasionally to buy some spices which I cannot get in other places. The price here is one of the highest in Las Vegas with low-average quality goods.

Personally I wont suggest this store If you are looking for quality items at cheap or moderate price because they don't offer either.",0

She always remembers my name and takes time to make sure I understand all the different beds and packages they offer.",1
210,"For a single incident, I would just swallow it.  After these few incidents, I will not use any cab in Charlotte especially from the airport.\nA month ago, I called a cab to the airport early in the morning.  I made it very clear that I need the cab at my house at 6 am as I have a flt to fly out.  I asked if that was posssible, the operator said yes.  It was around midnight when I called.\nAt 6 am, I looked over the window, there was no cab.  6:05 no cab.  I got nervous as I was catching a flt to go to work.  I called yellow cab again, then she said there was no cab available.  I screamed as I would miss my flight to work.  She said she was trying but she had never notified me earlier.  I couldn't wait as the clock ticks. I had no other choice but to wake up my neighbor to give me a ride.  Thank God, with the kindness of my neighbor and my professionalism, I ran and ran and ran inside the airport and finally got to the gate be the last one before they closed the door.\n3 weeks ago, I came home at the airport to take a cab since my house was within 3-4 miles.  It was my first time using a cab.  I didn't know how much here but I had in San Francisco for less than $15 (with airline discount, they charge $12).  So I thought I better to use a cab instead of calling friends around.  I need to go to my house to get my car key then to the hotel right by the airport to get my car.  I explained very clearly to the cab driver who said nothing about the charge.  He didn't turn on the meter as I thought charge shown on meter.  As I got to my house, he said he would charge me double.  I asked how much and why double and what was supposed to be?  He started to yell at me.  Finally, I was charged $28 for a 6 miles ride.  I didn't know if that was acceptable.  I said  to myself I learned, if he overcharged me, I treated that as donation and God blesses.  I was too busy.\nLast night, I took a cab again from CLT airport just to go home that was really 4 miles.  The driver was acting like a wild animal, very unfriendly, talking everything I had no idea what he was talking.  He kept saying I had no idea how long people were waiting.  I asked what people?  Other passengers?  They were behind me and shouldn't be longer than me.  Or the drivers?  I even asked him to take me back to the airport if he didn't want to have the business.  He was driving crazy and I hoped there was a police car closed by.  Unfortunately when we want to see a cop, they were not there but when we didn't want to see them, there was always one.\nFinally, I was safe home.  I still could not understand what was going wrong with these cab drivers.  If someone can help to explain to me.\nBTW, if these cab drivers hate their work, find another one.  I was still figuring out what was their problem.  Perhaps, a few miles were too short the trip?  They were looking for someone who needs to go 100 miles or to another city?  For long ride, people will rent a car for $20-$30 a day and gas.  People need a cab if that is more economic than renting a car for a day.  Anyway, at least I understand why they are still driving an angry cab cos they don't know how to do maths.",0
211,"I am a resident/local of Las Vegas.  Family and friends come from all over to visit me.  The last time (4/26/14) I tried to bring folks here- we were guest listed-waited in line for an(930) hour to be put in another line by a promoter promising it would be faster- I kindly ask the gentleman group in front of me how long they have been waiting, he said for 2 hours.\nWhen I finally got attention from the front door guy, he was so very RUDE to me that the gentleman group before me said forget this and left.  You would think the jerk was smart enough to know that patrons of an establishment such as this are the reason he gets a paycheck or a raise.  So I took my hot girlfriends to Surrender with NO problem and had a BLAST!\nPrior to this time, I waited in line for again-over an hour.  Got in and it was almost empty at 1145 on a Saturday.  The reason to wait for over an hour instead of being inside spending on drinks is completely ridiculous to do as a business!  I get that they want people walking by seeing people in a line so they can assume this is the spot to be.\nNOT!!!

213,"If you like long lines, and disappointment, this is the place for you.\n\nAs a minor fan of the show I decided it would be pretty cool to stop by and check the place out. The show is pretty interesting, (even if it is mostly faked and scripted) and being a Vegas local, I thought it would be a cool pay to kill a couple hours.\n\nI rolled up around 2pm and saw a line of tourists which wrapped around the store. The store front itself looks just like the one on the show and has no mention of Pawn Stars. Fortunately, the line moved quick and I got in with 20 minutes. \n\nThe shop itself was very small and somewhat unkept. Random things were piled behind the counters. Looks like they don't care to keep it clean when they aren't filing any episodes. Like a few other people mentioned, there really isn't much for sale. In fact, the interior is like a typical pawn shop, few weapons, jewelery, instruments and the like. If I did not go in knowing that this was the Pawn Stars shop, I probably would have thought it was just another generic pawn shop. \n\nThey didn't have much in the ways of cool an exotic collectibles or rare trinkets. They did have a pretty big section for souvenirs. Though I would hate to admit it, it seems more like a tourist trap. Get in, take a few pictures, move along,",0
214,"Yesterday was our first day using Desert Bloom Mobile Vet Service. After reading the reviews on Yelp and the testimonials on their website I figured I would give them a try since we were looking for a vet in Gilbert. \n\nHow unique to be able to have a vet come to the house...I've heard of concierge medicine but not for animals. \n\nI was thrilled they were able to squeeze me in, since 1 of my 3 dogs had an \""""emergency\"""" situation. Dr. Molina and her staff were wonderful from the moment they walked in the door. Very professional and my dog wasn't nervous because he was in his own environment. They were very thorough and provided a great service. \n\nWe were so happy with Dr. Molina that we will be having them come back to do a check up on our other two dogs and do teeth cleanings for all three of the boys:)\n\nI would highly recommend Desert Bloom Mobile Vet Service!",1

216,"Couldn't have experience worse customer service. Any martial art or self-defense system should have humility and a focus on people and passion for learning & teaching at heart.

I simply told the woman, that I am there to learn, not to coach & she then stated that they don't want people \""""stealing their methods\"""" as if I was going to teach the baseball, football and high-school athletes I worked with Krav Maga at a performance training facility focused on speed, power and agility.\n\nTwo more co-workers went in, including my girlfriend and it was the same song but different verse. Disappointed that there are \""""teachers\"""" out there that are so self conscious that they think not opening their doors to everyone willing to learn will somehow preserve and grow their business.\n\nSide note* their pricing is also ridiculous.

217,"As we had done in previous years following a Steelers game, we came to this place as it was conveniently located from our hotel, the Sheraton Station Square. The eight of us sat in a booth that had a few dishes remaining from the previous customers. Around 15 minutes passed without anyone greeting us for service or removing the dishes. Finally a young girl came to take our order. She apologized and cleaned off our table.\n\nWe ordered and then waited at least 30 minutes. A girl from our group went to question what was going on. Eventually the manager came out, apologized and said the food would be out in 3 minutes. At least 10 minutes passed. We questioned him again this time verbally expressing our irritation. He mentioned he fired 4 workers and took the blame. Regardless, we were all disgruntled.\n\nThen several minutes later the waitress came out and said she did not have any avocado and another ingredient and a few of our dishes could not be made. This was something they could have told us before we ordered and had to wait 40 or so minutes. One of the dishes that was supposed to have bacon came with baco bits instead. \n\nThe manager agreed to not bill us for the few items we received and with that we got up and left.\n\nWhile I do give credit to the manager and particularly to the young girl who was apologetic and did her best despite the circumstances, I find this kind of service unacceptable. This place is clearly mismanaged and this level of service has convinced me to never ever come to this bar again.\n\nIn order for this or any establishment to retain customers, it is important that they are fully prepared to service customers and if they are not then they at least communicate that to us early on so that our time is not wasted.",0
218,"OK, so this was my 1st visit even though I've lived in the East Valley for 20+ years.  I just never had an incentive to go.  \n\nAlright.  I understand the complaints of others that prices are somewhat higher than most.  But in my opinion that's most frequently a trade off of quality (while supporting a definite mom & pop local institution) vs. large-scale mass production.  For me, I almost always choose the quality.  Life is just too short to demand a value menu for the usual dreck that comes with it.\n\nHaving done the research on their website and Yelp, I kinda knew what I wanted, and I knew about where to order (cash register) and available items on the condiment bar.  Being by myself with $20 bucks to spend (Living Social -- ah, there's my incentive!), I start with a corn \""""cheez crisp\"""", and proceed to order a fish taco, a shrimp tostada, and a beef (carne asada) burro plus a Mexican beer (Bohemia, if you must know!)\n\nThe corn cheez crisp is more like a corn quesadilla, but it's made with a good quality white Mexican cheese (Chihuahua? maybe Menonita?)  Tasty, especially when dipped in their \""""hottest\"""" red salsa.  2 tortillas folded in half, easily polished off by myself, but better to share as to not take up unnecessary capacity for a tasty, yet mostly superfluous appetizer.\n\nThe tostada comes out next, with a very nice mix of frijoles (not whole beans) plus 4-5 shrimp, lettuce, onion, and sour cream drizzle (not a lump).  Very tasty.  The shrimp are griddled medium-rare.  I liked it quite a bit.\n\nNext, the fish taco and burro were up (your name is broadcast to let you know it's ready).  The fish taco is clearly up with the best I've ever eaten (including Mr. Taco in Rocky Pt, and yes, decidedly better than Rubio's).  The fish is very fresh, crispy, yet tender, and everything supports it.  Superior!\n\nI could stop there, but I really wanted to try the burro while it was fresh.  Man, I'm glad I did.  The carne was expertly seasoned and char-grilled while combined with some mashed avocado, frijoles (not whole beans) and pico.  In a way, I was sorry that I saved it for last.  But hooray!  I have 1/2 leftover for tomorrow -- no, couldn't stop with just 1 or 2 bites.\n\nAs for decor and ambiance, I'm a low-emotion computer dude, so that stuff really doesn't affect me (ha ha!  maybe that's why I'm eating by myself!).  But I can say that I really liked the outdoor sand & tables, the enclosed patio, and the insides.   To my way of thinking, it was an attractive beach party in downtown Chandler.  (Very family friendly, not rowdy at all, mostly gringos and not bikers ).\n\nService was good, food was very good, and pricing acceptable.  I'm sorry I glossed over them the last 20 years!",1

The rest of the staff was just as terrific. The food was the best BBQ I have ever had in a restaurant. Our entrees were the spareribs, baby back ribs and the brisket sandwich. Huge portions! All of the ribs were very meaty, excellently spiced, and delicious. Our sides included the mac and cheese (excellent), the corn muffins (addictive), and the fries. I loved the kale and cashew salad!  We tried the pork bellies and grits as an appetizer. Amazing! Very creative dessert menu! The best was that our server Les took us back through the kitchen to see the smoker. Got to meet the owner- very fun and appreciated!  Our server has an extensive restaurant background and it showed. We will definitely be consistent customers.",1

Upon entering the building we were greeted by the hostess, she told us it would be about a 10 minute wait, and if we wanted, we could go in the lounge for drinks & they would come get us when our table was ready.  We proceeded to the lounge and after a couple minutes the bartender came and took our order.  She asked us if we would like chips & salsa while we waited and we told her that would be great, well she NEVER BROUGHT THEM.  Several minutes later she finally came back to check on us, and I asked her if the hostess would come and get us back here and she assured us they would, she then let us know that we could just eat in the lounge so we didn't have to wait on a table, we decided that would be great since we were very hungry, and she said \""""I will get you some menus\""""...since it was taking forever for her to grab a couple menus I decided to go to the front and see how long it was until we got our table since we had already been waiting over 20 minutes.  When I asked, they said \""""we called you at 6:51 and you didn't answer\""""...I politely told them that we were in the lounge and were assured that someone would come get us when our table was ready, the hostess apologized and said she will work on getting us a table right away.  I went back to the lounge and sat back down, three other patrons came in, were seated, given chips and salsa right away, and drinks were being poured all the while we sat with NO SERVICE!  The bartender finally came back after 10 minutes of ignoring us and asked \""""so, do you want to eat in here?\"""", we said \""""we told you 10 minutes ago that we wanted to eat in here and you went to get menus and never came back, so no, we have decided to leave since we are getting terrible service\"""", she looked at us, gave a nasty dirty look and walked off.\nNeedless to say, we will NEVER return to this place.  How it has been in business for over 34 years is beyond me.

The food  left us desiring as well. Monotone tub of gnocchi. Pasta with meat sauce, fries and the calamari were good. Bruschetta was freshly made but just didn't have anything to it.

They seem to only be focused on stocking the shelves and going home to their lives. \n\nWhile the prices are fantastic, it is always difficult to find what you are looking for, because they keep changing where everything is located. \n\nAlso when it finally comes time to check out, you should be prepared to wait for at least 10-15 minutes, even if you only have one item.\n\nOverall, it could be a lot better.

241,"What can I say about Arlequino's? I'm a Montreal ex-pat living in Ottawa, but I always return home for my birthday to celebrate with friends from Montreal. From a distance, and through some searching I came upon this lovely sounding restaurant and booked it for my group of 16. Unfortunately this turned out to be a mistake of epic proportions. Let's follow the night in order of events.\n\nDrink orders:\nOne of my friends suggested we split a bottle of wine, a suggestion I liked, but neither of us are really wine connoisseurs. We asked the waitress for some suggestions, letting her know that we both preferred sweeter white wines, but she didn't know anything about the wine menu, \""""I don't really drink wine\"""" was her response. We asked her if anyone there knew, and she just shrugged. Not particularly helpful.\n\nAppetizers:\nOn reading some reviews a friend and I decided to try the calamari, they serve it here in long strips and it was fried up nicely, but there was very little flavouring to it without any dipping sauce. The sauce they served it with seemed to be some sort of mayo-based sauce but I didn't really know what it was, and it didn't taste very good. Another of my friends ordered the fried bocconcini, it sounded nice but for $7 it came with 2 pieces, which is a little disappointing. The ceasar salad I ordered was tasty if a bit too salty.\n\nPizza:\nWhile I won't comment second hand on everyone else's pizza experience, I will talk about the one I tried. I ordered the Pescara, which sounded very nice as: tomato sauce, cheese, pancetta and hot peppers. First this is not the wood burning pizza you would expect. As reviewer Dave I. suggests this is not authentic wood burning pizza. The top had burnt crusts yet the cheese was completely evenly cooked and well spaced out and the bottom was soggy, and not crispy at all. The worst of it was the over-abundant use of hot peppers on this particular variation; the rest of the ingredients couldn't be tasted with the amount of hot peppers they used, it was just completely unbalanced. I would have tasted the same flavours had I just eaten some soggy dough and a jar of hot peppers.\n\nDessert:\nHere's where my biggest issue of the night started. When I called to book they had asked if I wanted a birthday cake. I thought \""""why not?\"""" and chose a cake. Now it's certainly my fault at this point for not asking the cost of this added service, but for they price they charged they could have mentioned it. This restaurant claimed to have made the cake in house and charged $5 per person for the cake (a total of $75). Now I know this is how some higher end restaurants work, and while I wouldn't call Arlequino's higher end, it's their right to choose this business model. My issue of contention is not the actual cost of the cake but the reaction of the owner of the restaurant when I spoke to him about this issue. I calmly and politely told him that if they were going to charge such an exorbitant amount for a tiny cake, the least they could do is tell people the cost up front without having to be asked. Had I known, I would have brought my own cake. His response was: \""""We'd have charged you $3 per person if you brought your own. What can I tell you? It's business.\"""" For me this was an inadequate response to a customer concern. I'm not saying I expected him to reimburse me for the cake; I didn't expect any sort of gratuity, but the man didn't even have the decency to apologize or attempt to appease me in any sort of way. This is no way to manage any sort of service industry business, let alone a restaurant. His response was equally cold and careless to one of my friends who tried to speak to him about the same issue. \n\nThat final experience of the night led me to understand Arlequino's for what it is. This is an upscale, supposedly hip pizzeria. The decor and ambience are fantastic, but their downfall is that they are far more invested in the look than the quality of food or their customers' satisfaction. I certainly imagine that the owner will begin to care more about his customers when they stop coming to eat at this restaurant.",0
242,I've used other lawyers for my accidents before and I can definitely say that CPK takes off the edge of the accident the minute I talk to them.  They think of everything and they make sure I get checked up with a chiropractor.  I've always been happy with their service each time.  My husband has taken speed tickets to them a few times and so does some of his friends.  I love that I don't have to deal with the stress.,1

244,"Green peppercorn shrimp and calamari has got to be the house joke. Three tiny shrimp, not even measuring an inch in diameter, along with rings of Calamari so minuscule they resembled small rubber bands.

246,"Open six weeks. Pros are:  25 local brews and IPAs on tap and full bar. Cons are: since it says \"""" neighborhood grill\"""", I was hoping for a new neighborhood bar with GOOD FOOD. Wrong! Why can't we have a local place that serves good fresh food that's tasty!? Does the staff even taste what they are serving? Maybe 15 items on menu. The bartender boasted about the roasted turkey so I tried the turkey tacos. Menu says it is roasted turkey with cranberry sauce and shaved sweet potatoe. When my dish arrived, it was two tiny tacos on a huge plate. That's it. No garnish, no dipping sauce... The tortillas were grilled, the turkey was no big deal, and the sweet potatoe fries were burnt and greasy sprinkled all over the top. Greasy burnt flavor with each bite. Restaurants should know and love what they are serving. I took two bites and sent it back. I've read other reviews and see that I'm not the only that agrees with the lack of food quality and flavor. Come on Spokes! Listen to your potential fans and step it up a notch! If anyone's wondering were to go with awesome home cooked food and dive bar setting.. TryPranksters! Hint hint spokes.",0
247,"When we asked some local Mexican friends where to go for authentic Mexican food and, in particular, mole, they unanimously recommended Pepe's.  Howard Seftel's AZ Republic review also recommended the chicken enchiladas with mole.\n\nWe went for lunch on a Sunday and fortunately did not witness any \""""deals\"""" going down.  The restaurant's in a stand-alone building with ample parking.  It's spacious inside with high-backed wooden booths and a long bar.\n\nWe ordered:\n- Enchiladas de Pollo con Mole:  3 flour tortillas wrapped around shredded chicken breast, covered with black mole and cheese, served with refried beans and rice\n - Tacos Rancheros:  mildly spicy slow-braised pork in choice of soft or crispy taco\n\nThe verdict:\n- The mole sauce was a delicious combination of spices and chocolate - we wished there could've been more.  I actually prefer dark meat so next time I'll order the Mole Poblano, where they give you choice of chicken leg or breast.  \n- Described as a house specialty, the pork was tender and infused with spices.  According to a review posted on the wall, chopped chorizo is also mixed in. \n\nDishes on average run between $8 to $10.\n\nWe're eager to go back to try the green corn tamales, taco monterrey (machado (sun-dried beef) w/ scrambled eggs) and of course, more mole!",1

Great people watching.\n\nWe sprang for some sparkling wine with our tapas, which was pricey but complimented our snacks. We enjoyed the marinated olives (pretty much what you would expect) and the burrata, which was excellent. I didn't want it to end. Lovely texture and flavor.\n\nThe waitress was a little snobby and didn't seem to stoked on our restaurant.com certificate but I don't really understand the attitude since the certificate stipulates that 18% gratuity will be added to the bill automatically.

Bill was $72 without tip and gratuity and before our restaurant.com certificate.\n\nAnd, just a small rant that isn't Fleur's fault: \n\nThere was a small girl hanging on the short railing along the patio...inches away from our food. Staring at us, breathing on our food...and the parents said NOTHING! For about five minutes this goes on! Seriously, control your kid. Keep them away from people who are dining.

Everyone says the portions are huge... Not the case in my meal. My hash browns were VERY DRY and tasted as if they have been sitting in the skillet all morning. The hollandaise sauce for my eggs Benedict was bland and so thick I thought I was eating cold, condensed soup from a can. I ate one Benedict, two bites of hash browns and asked for the bill. When the waitress saw that I barely ate my food, she didn't even ask me how it was. I got my to go box and threw my meal away in the garbage out front.

250,"Farnworth is a HORRIBLE management company. I finally moved largely to get out from under them. They wouldn't plant grass in front of the house I was renting or fix the gate or a ton of other things, and whenever the city fined them for violations, they'd turn around and fine me for it. I was usually able to avoid the fines (since they were illegal and out of the lease), but it always meant writing legal-style letters back and forth, visiting the tenant advocates office in Phoenix, etc. etc. So it was a tremendous waste of my time, and they were beyond rude every time I contacted them.\n\nAnd then, when it was finally time to move, I deep-cleaned the apartment to a ridiculous extent. I had ex-military guys helping me, and we cleaned it to beyond military standards. And Farnsworth still kept my security deposit, supposedly because I hadn't landscaped the back yard, even though it was clearly in the lease and in tenant law that it wasn't my responsibility. I tried to sue them to return my deposit but their lawyers somehow got the case dismissed and I haven't had time to start the process again. But the point is, STAY AWAY FROM FARNSWORTH AT ALL COST! You don't need the aggravation.",0
251,"Cashed in on the Expedia save $300 deal and got a flight from LAX to Vegas and 1-night at the Wynn (+$100 resort credit for food/bev) for $1.63. Yep, you read that correctly...1 dollar, 63 cents.\n\nThe hotel itself wasnt too crowded for holiday season. Check-in was smooth and painless. I was able to check-in at 9AM, even though the listed time is 3PM. Very convenient!\n\nI stayed in a Deluxe Panoramic View room on the \""""59th\"""" floor. Really I think its the 49th since the elevator skips 10 floor numbers. Not sure whats going on there. The rooms are pretty nice and definitely have a luxurious feel.

Most reno's on the strip are adding those features.\n\nThe Terrace Pointe Cafe at the Wynn is pretty good. The Sangria was reasonably priced and delicious.The Mahi Mahi Tacos were awesome! Not too filling which was good since we were hitting the buffet later on.\n\nThe Wynn Buffet is one of the best on the strip. I still think the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort Spa Casino in Henderson beats the Wynn's buffet hands down (and its cheaper). Check it out.\n\nThe 24-hour cafe is way overpriced.

259,"Buyer beware.  Took advantage of the New Years special this evening, (buy one Delmonico steak between 9-10pm and get the second one for free).  Upon explaining to our waiter that we wanted to take advantage of their \""""advertised special\"""" in the AZ Central dining deals from AZ Republic that had been advertised since December 21st on this website,we were informed he was not aware of such special.  Upon which my date and I felt totally embarrassed as I didn't want to look like I was just trying to get something for nothing.  He checked with his manager and said \""""they would honor it\"""", a $28.99 value, but that it was the AZ central error.  From that point on our waiter was very short with us and made us feel like we're putting him out because he wasn't going to make as much in tips from us.  \n\nThis couldn't be further from the truth, as all items were alacarte and with wine it actually came out to more than if we had ordered steaks alone.  The steaks by the way were excellent, but the tone for the evening with the poor service didn't make up for the taste and presentation of the food.  By the way, we overheard the couple in the booth behind us request the same special, but by that time the restaurant was aware that people would be comming in for the special.\n\nFinally to make matters worse, when we got bill for the two of us it had an automatic gratuity of 20% added to the bill.  When I explained to the waiter that this must be a mistake he explained that it was \""""their policy\"""" to add on this automatic charge whenever they have to \""""give away food\"""".  When I explained that I didn't feel comfortable in paying such a high mandatory amount, he immediately said he would get the manager and stormed off in a huff.\n\nManager Eric S. came over and supported his waiter by basically backing him up and not listening to our valid complaints.  He actually stormed off also when we told him we wanted to have him adjust the gratuity to what was a more fair assessment of service at 10-15%.  He came back and gave a half hearted apology for \""""feeling threatened\"""" when I told him I would let others know of their lousy customer service. So there you have it, It appears that their is an attitude at the Arrowhead grill is greater than though, and how dare we to complain.  Needless to say we will not ever be back though the food was good,not worth the hassle and a terrible New Years Eve meal ruined by their ineffective ability to act professional and with grace and understanding.",0

Impossible to pass, or be passed, without bumping into anything. Which is highly prohibited. \n\nTo sum it all up, two words: OVER PRICED.

This place is REALLY NICE----lots of staff on the floor and they are friendly, you can stand and chat with them, they are sooo helpful  They have helmets for you.  You can also purchase a video of your driving.  They offer transportation to their venue.  I rented a car when I was in Vegas.  I will be back again -----for sure next time I am in Vegas.  The prices are worth it!!!! It is an Experience Just do it!!! Thank you Exotics racing! Amazing Staff---they made it fun.",1
276,I would never buy clothes here but I did try to bring 25 new jerseys here and they said they couldnt take them because they would just get stolen. I paid $100 each and they offered $0. They have one knock-off for $35 on the rack. Not my cup of tea.,0
277,WARNING!!!! Do NOT rent or use this company for your management needs. If you rent from them say goodbye to your entire deposit. I was renting a property managed by this company and not only did they took my entire deposit but they are actually charging me more on top of that. I left the house in great condition. I added landscape and took really good care of it. This are very bad people. They take advantage of common renters like you or me.,0
278,"Good location but they don't have much competition in the Vegas Valley so I think the prices are pumped up a bit more than if they had a major competitor. This lack of competition also makes them not care about marketing. Every time I call for pricing and availability the people give you a feeling you are bothering them if you aren't a big player and building a casino. No reflection on the yard guys,,,,, they are helpful and friendly....also the effect shows in lack of a web site with prices and inventory that would eliminate me bothering the counter help and let me estimate my own jobs.....but they are the big player in town and I'm just a little guy....I would give them a 5 star review  if they would get a web site with prices and material. I don't care if the counter guys were cranky, I'm not looking for drinkin' buddies..",0
279,"Great atmosphere to enjoy a Sunday brunch! Wait was not bad they will text you when table is ready. Portion vs price ratio was good. We had fresh orange juice and coffee, banana nut flapjacks and the Mr. Had eggs Benedict with delicious hash browns! Will definitely be back again.",1
280,"Came here to get quarters for the parking meter, but felt guilty asking for change so we decided to purchase something. The man behind the counter was SO nice, and when I started asking questions about what everything was, he very patiently explained it all to me. Zam Zam water is holy water, didja know that? You can buy it here if you want! \n\nThey also have quite possibly the BEST baklava I have ever had: hazelnut, drizzled in chocolate, perfectly made. LOVED it. I am going to see if they can ship it to me, I have never had baklava that delicious and now that I have I don't think I can live without it. \n\nYUMMMMM!",1
281,"We finally tried the talked about Brunch at the Grand Concourse. Going in with high expectations, we left very underwhelmed. Not only are the food stations scattered around the dining room, but the food options themselves are lacking. \n\nThe 'hot station' has what I would call your typical breakfast buffet (eggs, bacon, sausage, etc.). There's a carving station with prime-rib, ham and turkey - the high point of the meal.\n\nSalad option were mushy, and the Bananas Foster was a quickly thrown together imitation, though the donut station was unique.\n\nMy made-to-order Bloody Mary was good, though.\n\n3 cocktails and two brunches for $75 -- I was expecting much, much more.",0
282,"Best pizza on the planet!  Wouldn't hesitate recommending this place.\n\nWe went for dinner even though we had heard there would be a LONG wait.  Only waited about 20 minutes but was worth the wait.  Best pizza, great service.\n\nWent back for lunch the next day and the manager greeted us by name.  Makes one feel valued;-)",1
283,"Do NOT go here for brunch on Sunday.  It was an uncoordinated disaster.  They messed up our reservation and really had a bad attitude about their mistake.  We asked the bartender for a beer list and he pointed at the chalkboard without speaking and walked away.  Our waitress told us she just woke up and didn't have it together yet.  She was right, she was unprepared to come to work and it showed.  The brunch food was adequate at best.\n\nThe beer selection was great, so that's why it's 2 stars and not 1.  I would consider going back for dinner when they might have their A team working.",0
284,"Gave it another try & unfortunately I won't be back. \n\nOrdered the Avocado Club with Chicken. No bacon or ranch. Came out as a Avocado Club with Meat. Don't eat red meat. Had a feeling cashier wasn't listening very well when I ordered. This was confirmed when he handed me the receipt & asked me TWICE what my change was. Wow. \n\nFor $20.70 we got an Avocado Club with a fountain drink, a mushroom swiss burger with smash fries & a bottled root beer. A lil pricey now that I think about it. Nothing special to these 'creations' other than the meat being 'smashed'. No special ingredients or sauces. I can make this at home for a lot cheaper. \n\nStaff is still awkward. Cleaning with products as people are eating. Also employees eating in dinning room in uniform. No. No. No. \n\nAhhh good luck to y'all.",0
285,"I took a pair of shoes to this place.  It was a simple repair, they just needed the straps glued back in.  I was shocked when I went in and there were display cases of watches and only old shoes in sight.  It looked like a fence for something.  I showed him my shoes and he told me the only thing he could do was staple the straps on the outside.  The shoes are Steve Madden Juke and it would have change the entire look.  He informed me that was the look now.  Um no, I'll try somewhere else and left.  I took them to another shop and the owner glued them and fixed them for me for $15.

Something is amiss...~) and all the merchandise looks like bland, generic stuff you can get at the dollar store or a yard sale for cheaper. This place used to be my thrift store go-to, but at these prices and the change in the type of merch they place on the floor, it's only \""""meh\"""" now.

288,"I first knew this property as the bank where you could park after hours to avoid the parking nightmare at Texaz grill.  Now they have their own parking problem and provide valet during busy hours.

Our group of ten was seated at a long table on the \""""patio\"""".  This space can be open to the air or heated or cooled as necessary.  The main interior can be wide open or closed off from the patio.  The patio area also has a second bar that can serve when they are busy.\n\nI had the Vigazz burger.  The burger was really good but I would hesitate to call it great.  The sweet potato fries I chose were perfectly cooked.  The Bloody Mary was OK and the iced tea was pretty weak.  I also had a chance to try the guacamole, I liked it but I thought it could be seasoned some more.   Most of us had portions that we either had to abandon or take home. \n\nThe service was great.  The bathroom seemed a little weird, They were clean enough, the sink was a modern sloped design but they had old style folding towel dispensers.  I would certainly go back here again.",1

291,"Dear Yelp, it's official: I AM 21.:D\n\nFor my 21st birthday, I spent the night at a room here. I must say, quite a fun place to spend a 21st birthday at!\n\nRoom: HUGE. To begin with, it was already in the older tower and yet it was still quite impressive. Two comfortable beds, a couch, a chair, a table/mini-office space and a fridge....it was almost like a miniature apartment. The view was also quite amazing, looking right over the pool and straight at the Strip. Oh, and it had a fridge, a plus seeing I needed to have refreshments for the get-together I was having.\nService: Can't really say, we were just partying it up in there. \nLocation: Not on The Strip, but close enough, with free shuttle service to Harrahs and Ballys. \nPool: It was amazing with a bold, capital A. Crowded, but not overwhelmingly so. Beautiful people all around, and not overrun with the douchebags you see so much of at somewhere like, say, the Palms or Mandalay Bay pool areas. One cheesy, but cool touch was the waterfall that came out of a clam. \nMiscellaneous: As great as the room was, I was charged a security deposit of $50 that I had no way of knowing about beforehand. At least it wasn't a blasted resort fee, but still.\n\nThe Final Verdict:\n\nPros:\nMore than enough space.\nFridge in the room.\nLovely view.\nEpic pool.\nFree shuttle to the Strip.\nNice enough bathroom. \nOffered two free passes to the Voodoo Lounge.\nLots of things to do on the property.\nGot the room for a pretty sweet price as well ($53.00).\n\nCons:\nSneaky security deposit. It's refunded when you check out but still. \n\nSuggestions: Please let people know about the security deposit in advance. So next time someone wants to have their birthday there they won't be $50 short on drinking and partying funds. \n\nWould I stay here again? I'd stay here again just for that pool.",1
292,"I will never set foot in this store ever again after today.  About three weeks ago I brought my bike to them after a friend suggested the store to fix a warped chain that was extremely annoying.  Upon inspection from the guys, the gears were also wearing very poorly because of the warped chain, so they suggested to replace those too.  I figured why not, might as well get the whole assembly fixed up nice.  They needed to order one part, which would take about a week.  The following Thursday I get a phone call that the part was in and I immediately brought my bike to the shop for them to fix and I left it with them.  Before I left, I asked about how long they thought it would take to fix it.  I was told they would try to get to it on Friday, and if not I'd have it early next week.\n\nGreat!  I'm all excited, it's just gonna suck to have to walk everywhere for a few days, but it'll be worth it.  So 4th of July weekend comes and goes, didn't get my bike on Friday, (Monday was the 4th) Tuesday, or Wednesday.  So on Thursday, I call and they tell me that they've been very busy and backed up and shorthanded and they didn't come in over the holiday weekend to work.  He can't give me an exact update other than there are only 3 bikes ahead of mine.  No call Thursday.  On Friday I call again.  It's now a week after they told me I should expect my bike.  They inform me that they should be getting to it that day.  Low and behold, late afternoon I get a phone call that it's ready.  At 5 after work, I go and pick it up.  I pay them and I ride home without a problem.  \n\nYesterday, I rode to work without a problem.  When I went home last night, the gears started skipping.  I wasn't having this problem before they fixed the bike though, so I was very confused.  This morning, I'm on my way to work, just pulling out of my street onto Neglley and the gears skipped in the middle of the road.  I also got hit!!  Scared the hell out of me.  A normal 10 minute bike ride took close to 20 minutes because I couldn't get proper power out of my bike.\n\nToday at 11, when the shop opened, I was their first customer.  I brought the bike in and the tech took a look at the chain and said one of the links was busted.  The chain is 4 days old.  So he fixed it free of charge by just replacing the broken link.  Either way, I don't like the fact that a chain broke so easily.  I paid over $120 for them to keep my bike for a week and for me to have to go back a few days later because something they replaced had already broke.\n\nLike I said at the top, I'll never go back...",0

All of my friends were adamant about other places and I was rooting for the nice bartender and the possibility of a song.\n\nWhen we arrived the place was packed! Yet she still knew I was the one who called (very Children of the Corn). I immediately (at 8:15) put 2 songs in. I said you can just pick one if it fits your line-up. Hoping they'd call me and then one of the 4 people I strung along would add a song in.\n\nThis did not happen. \n\nWhile we each had 3-4 drinks (and 14 songs played), yes, I counted them. Not one persons name was EVER called. It was like a 2-disc CD was playing and they already knew who was next. \n\nIf you are new and you are going here to sing. Wait to be disappointed. It's so weird. Not like a cool dive bar weird, but like a scripted twilight zone that you will never be a part of weird. \n\nThis bar doesn't need you.

REALLY HARD!  But all the ear-splittingly-loud Bon Jovi covers and manically juggled cheap booze in the world can't mask the oppresively depressing nature of the bar's denizens: blue collar mooks, on perpetual Spring Break from a third-tier community college, desperate to bag whatever beat-up white trash trim they can scare up.  Bachelerotte parties celebrating some unfortunate muffin-topped truck-stop waitress's thrird marriage.  Bowling alley attendants and their factory-worker wives, gaping maws open wide and turned up like baby birds to catch the cheap drizzle of sticky booze being poured down like proletariat manna by the bartenders, who tend to get up on the bar and tease the patrons with \""""free shots\"""" poured directly from unmarked bottles.

OVER and OVER and OVER, in a grim, desperate attempt at merrymaking.  This place is DETERMINED TO MANUFACTURE FUN OUT OF NOISE, as if sound waves can conquer misery and squalor.

We were confirmed for the guest list, but we were promptly held up by the ID checkers, who claimed that we looked nothing like our photo IDs.

Needless to say, my friend and I were upset. We attempted to talk to someone in charge, but they all looked away uncomfortably and said that whatever the bouncer says, goes - unless we happened to be carrying our passports. Neither of us have EVER had this happen to us before, so of course we were not carrying our passports with us.

305,"The one thing that cannot be disputed about Lim's -- a well-established restaurant in the West Valley -- is that the service is very friendly.  \n\nOkay:  that was the generous part of this review.  Buckle your seatbelt:  this isn't going to be a smooth ride.\n\nOnce again, my theorem about YELP has been confirmed:  the more stars a restaurant has, the more you should avoid it.  I'm convinced that every prisoner released from Sheriff Joe's tent city is promised a $20 bill for their first night's meal in freedom, PROVIDED they write a review on YELP.  How else can one explain the 4 and 5 stars for this place?  Certainly, it couldn't be for the fluorescent lit diner atmosphere... and it certainly couldn't be for the food... could it?!?\n\nThe Hot n Sour soup was okay.  My partner thought it too sour.  Hello!  The \""""sour\"""" isn't in the name to make it sound pretty.  I didn't think it too sour at all and they certainly don't skimp on ingredients:  the soup is loaded.  From there, however, it started going downhill faster than a snowball down the side of a steep ski run.\n\nThe egg rolls, too, weren't bad... a bit greasy, but filled almost exclusively with cabbage, which I like.  But the two dishes specifically mentioned in reviews here -- the Devil Beef and the Mu Shu Pork -- were as disappointing as a visit to the U.S. Senate.  Unfortunately, the quality of the food matched the Senate's performance, too.  Even before I could open my mouth, my other half said what I was thinking when they brought the beef out:  \""""My God!  It looks like someone's already eaten it!\""""  Mushy, grey, and in spite of the jalapenos in it, bland.  Sort of like Senator John McCain, except it wasn't demanding we go to war in Syria.  And while it is advertised in the menu, Chinese food with... jalapenos?!?  Chinese-Mexican fusion?!?!  \n\nThe Mu Shu Pork was something I'd never seen before in the many years I've eaten Chinese:  pre-rolled Mu Shu.  Usually, they bring you the wrapping and the filling is on the side and you make it yourself.  Not here:  they do it for you.  That by itself might have been acceptable to all but the Mu Shu Pork fanatic.  But what wasn't acceptable was the salt level in the food.  Unless you have a high tolerance for salty food, prepare to have lots of water nearby and watch your blood pressure go into the 150s over 110!\n\nService was fast, but almost like something out of a bad comedy about Chinese restaurants:  everything was brought at once, regardless of how close you were to finishing the previous course.  The only thing they DIDN'T do was observe you from a distance and wait for you to finish eating.\n\nIt pains me to give a bad review to a restaurant, which is obviously trying to please its customers.  In this case, however,  I'm afraid the review is fully justified.  I don't know who the people are on here, who think this is quality food.  I can only say to that one person, for example, who said he/she wishes this place was closer so he/she didn't have to drive all the way here:  KEEP DRIVING!  \n\nI rarely leave food on my plate and, when I do, I always ask for a doggie bag to take the leftovers home.

Got seated in about 20 minutes, which was pretty good considering how crowded they were and the fact that it was Black Friday. Our food came out pretty quickly and everything was good, though I will say that the location in San Diego was better. While the portions were really large for most places, they were much smaller than the SD location, though that's not a bad thing since there was no place to take leftovers for us and it feels a bit weird to eat a burger with a knife and fork because it's literally impossible to pick it up. Service was a bit slow, but not annoyingly so. I wouldn't be afraid to hit it up again the next time I'm in Vegas.",1

309,"I was excited to come here, especially since it was in the City Center at the Aria Hotel. Our friend Cassie had a friend that was promoting this club that night and so he got all the girls in for free and the guys had to pay $10, which is definitely a deal. \n\nWhen we got in, we had our pictures taken and then proceeded to the bar to get drinks. They were pricey! $14 for a fuzzy navel and $12 for a Heineken!! (I thought that was over the top, especially for this club, but what could you do? I would say drink a lot before and then get a drink or 2 here) The place was nicely decorated, and there were VIP/Bottle Service seats all around. My group stayed behind the bar in one of the corners (we had a group of 17) so we needed space. \n\nThe music was ALL trance-like. The DJ would trick us with playing out a good song for like 3-5 seconds and then mess it up and play more trance. It was cool at first, but then it got old and we wanted more of a variety. Some of the girls feet were hurting so we sat down and then got told we couldn't sit down because it was reserved for bottle service. I thought that was stupid because NO one was sitting there, and it wasn't like we were making a mess. I could understand if the table was reserved, but it wasn't and there were tons of other tables around. Then I took my heels off and was told i had to have shoes on. So basically everyone pretty much stood around.\n\nOverall, drinks were pricey, place was small and too strict on everything, music could be better, and seemed like it was more for the older crowd.",0

It was kind of tucked back in the hotel compared to some of the other places we walked past. \n\nOnce I got past the fact I felt like I was eating in a hallway of a shopping mall and paying $25 a plate for that luxury, I had fun. They were busy and we waited for the table we got. All of us ordered the spaghetti with filet Mignon meatballs. The two meatballs were a decent size. My dad said he wished they had put more sauce on the pasta, which I think I could have agreed. \n\nThe drinks comes in cans or bottle so don't expect a regular refill situation here. I ordered unsweetened iced tea and got the largest bottle on the table. The food came out quick. It all felt kind of rushed. The minute your fork was down they were taking your plate away. I enjoyed it, but I would not eat there again even though I gave them four stars. I think there are too many other places to pick from that don't give the frantic feel while you eat. The owner did come out and take our order and was very nice. They were all very nice to us.",0
311,"Many airports these days are attempting to become more upscale; there are sculptures and musicians and art and fancy food. In theory this is great! If I'm going to pay more for buying food in an airport, I might as well be paying for something good, right? Problem is, when it goes wrong, I just feel cheated. They should know better!\n\nTake Humble Pie. Theoretically a gourmet pizza joint in the Phoenix airport, the pizza they gave me was one of the worst I've had in YEARS. The crust was soggy, the toppings spartan, the sauce sickly-sweet and the greasiness unbearable. When I first picked up a slice, all the toppings promptly fell off. I tried to put the toppings back on, but the greasiness of the pizza left me to eat it two-handed: first a bite of the crust, then a bite of the toppings.\n\nReally, even if this place billed itself as a super-cheap pizza joint I'd feel cheated.",0
312,"Pretty good little Mexican food place. The portions are large, the service is fairly quick and the prices are fair.  I had the carne asada tacos and they were good. I saw someone order the carne asada fries and those looked good as well and massive in size. I'll be back.",1
313,"It takes a lot to impress me when it comes to hotels in Vegas. I've been a frequent guest of this town for the past 25 years, and even a resident. \n\nWhen the Bellagio opened up about 10-15 years ago, I thought that it was nice. The Venetian was gorgeous. But, nothing popped up that just changed the game for me....until I saw the Cosmo!\n\nIt is by far, the most gorgeous property that I've ever laid eyes on.\n\nThe casino floor is nice! The dealers at each table are friendly, know how to run a game, and show their personalities.\n\nThe restaurants are to die for. Try Holsteins, and grab some fries. Cooked in duck fat! Or an alcoholic shake!\n\nThe Marquee club is pretty nice too! They pull in some big name talent, so you know you will have a great night.\n\nOh....and the Chandelier! It's a bar inside a massive chandelier! \nYeah....you heard right.\n\nIf you want to take a dip in the pool, you'll find it has some of the best views of Las Vegas. It overlooks the strip! Probably one of the best hotel pools in town!\n\nNo Vegas trip is complete without a trip to the Cosmo! Even if you are staying elsewhere, it's worth the time and money to check out the features of the place. \n\nI can't wait for my next trip! Oh yeah...later today! Score.",1
314,"Look, I know what (not) to expect from what is actually a Motel 6. The rooms themselves are so-so for the price range, but the service is TERRIBLE.\n\nI booked my stay online, and it was a WASTE OF TIME. The first receptionist (albeit a sweetheart) was absolutely clueless that such a process even existed. Ignoring the small deposit, with the summary of the remaining balance listed in the online confirmation I had her read, she had no record of any reservation made. Despite being charged a small portion of the night's charges already, my remaining balance was ignored, and I was charged the full amount.\n\n\""""You don't need to make reservations; we're pretty much NEVER full\"""", she said. This is important.\n\nMy room was a bit lacking in basic bathroom supplies, so when I returned to the lobby late that night I was blown off by the second receptionist. \""""We don't keep any of that here\"""", she said sternly, moving on to the next task*. EVERY hotel and motel I have ever been to (read my reviews, I go to a lot) keeps items in or near the lobby. This is unacceptable, even for this chain.\n\nOh, and by \""""next task\"""", I mean telling two gentlemen there were no rooms available whatsoever, despite the fact there were still openings online and the previous staff member acknowledged the facility was no where near capacity. \n\nSo basically, there is complete ignorance of the online booking function, an absolute disregard for basic hospitality, and at worst, the unethical practice of straight up lying to potential customers to deny service. Never coming back.",0
315,"BY FAR THE WORST BUFFET I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE. IF THERE IS A GOOD REVIEW, IT WAS MADE BY A PERSON WHO WOULD EAT $HIT IF IT WAS HANDED TO THEM.\n\nIf you like crab legs then maybe worth it, and you have to know how to pick from the pot. \nDinner is not worth it. Have not tried breakfast and can't imagine lunch is any better than dinner. \nFor the money try Monte Carlo, harrahs, Rio, luxor. The best buffet is bellagio by far but it is more expensive.",0
316,"This was a spur of the moment choice for dinner Saturday night..they were kinda busy so the sat us at the bar..Bartender super cute personality and suggested the blue raspberry sake which was pretty good..We waited maybe 10 minutes before being seated..Decided to split the special which was soup/salad/appetizer/entree (shrimp, lobster, filet mignon, and chicken) OMG it was AMAZING!! The salad was really good w/the ginger dressing..tempura veggies were greatness..the entree (because my date is allergic to seafood, I got the lobster and shrimp) And it was beyond delicious..The chicken and steak were pretty good for the bite that I received lol..All and all a great experience!",1
317,"So the boba here is good, depending on who makes it. The food is hit or miss depending on what time of day you get it. I usually get Pad Thai here and sometimes it's fantastic, sometimes you wonder what the hell they put in it. Needless to say, I got food poisoning this last time around so I think I'll just stick to the boba. Other than that, the staff is pretty cool. It'll do in a pinch.",0
318,"I needed a massage badly since I have accumulated major tension along my entire back and shoulder areas. I wanted to keep it simple since this would be my first time at Ovarium. I've been used to amazing massages in NYC and this would be my first massage in Montreal. The ambiance was really serene and the people who worked there were very helpful. The place was clean and quiet. I met with Monica, where she took me to my private room, tastefully decorated with calming background music. We took 5 min to go over any health issues and she asked me if I have any specific areas that needed specific attention. The massage was so soothing with good pressure. She was very professional and never spoke during the session, which is what I like. There is a small lounge where you can gather yourself after the massage to recompose- you know, grogginess post massage, and have tea or something to drink. I liked it so much I plan to return next week. Hopefully it will be a great experience as the first time.",1
319,"Decided to celebrate our 11th anniversary here, and we were not disappointed! The setting was romantic without being too stuffy, the service top notch, and the food outstanding. I had the sea scallops with a side of potatoes au gratin, and my wife had the tuna. Both dishes were terrific, and the server's wine pairing top notch. Will definitely be back, although probably at the more-convenient South Park location.",1
320,"I too was at the work training with Ayesha (see very first review) and like her I wanted something different than the usual fast food places nearby.  \n\nI'm an incredibly picky person when it comes to authentic Mexican food.  Growing up in San Diego, I grew up with some of the best tasting food around.  When I moved here I was unimpressed over and over again with the places I kept trying around the west valley and even the east valley.  At one point, I even swore off trying any new Mexican style restaurant altogether.  No more gross, greasy, no flavor Mexican food for me!  The Sonoran style food here just doesn't jive with me and my taste for flavorful Baja style food.  Yep, that's right...there's a difference.  Baja style is tastier with a lot more flavor per bite.  I have found that Sonoran is more bland and greasier.\n\nI was pretty skeptical when we walked into Jalapenos (Tio Freddy's).  But then I picked up their menu and saw they had Carne Asada Fries...a San Diego favorite!  Forget everything else on the menu, that is what I ordered.  It was delicious!  Not only was the food flavorful but Tio Freddy and his wife were amazing.  Even though it is a place where you order at the counter, they brought me my food, offered me sauce from the sauce bar, and came by more than once to check on how I was enjoying my food!  \n\nIt is a small place in a strip mall and I have never noticed it before, and I know others haven't.  If you want to try some great Mexican food at a really inexpensive price...try it out!",1
321,"Rock climbing was one of those things that I always thought was cool but didn't really intend to try out. But again, Groupon has given me the opportunity to check this place out. In turn, I'm really starting to like this (expensive) sport even if I am awful at it right now.\n\nThe Groupon was good for two people and it gives you access to a beginner's class once a week for 1 month. The classes are offered on Saturdays (that's the one I chose) and another day during the week (sorry, I forgot!). Along with the classes, they also give you one month of unlimited access with gear so you can come in a practice your skills. The one item not included but would be super useful is the hand chalk.  \n\nI'm not going to lie but when you walk in, it smells like stinky feet. But you get over this relatively quickly. The walls are covered in colorful rocks of different sizes. Parts of the ceiling are as well. I've never seen anything like it! It's quite overwhelming at first. You'll see really advanced folks traversing or climbing away, making themselves look oh so graceful. They have tape all over the walls, indicating the path you should take for a certain level. \n\nSecond and third floors are much smaller than the first. These floors are set up for bouldering, whereas the first floor you can actually get into a harness and utilize the ropes for climbing. I've always gone in the early evenings/late nights and the second and third floors are pretty packed. Perhaps it's better to go in the mornings. \n\nI'm still a newbie at this. Learning all of the terms and techniques are boggling my brain! But with Matt the class instructor, I have confidence that I'll get better soon! Matt is super patient and is thorough with his explanations which I am super appreciative of! \n\nDisclaimer to all those that have not done this: You will be sore. No joke. I look like a robot when I walk right now. You will get blisters on your hands. Battle wounds on your legs. But trust me, it's all worth it!",1
322,"Not my favorite by far.  I've eaten inside once and had delivery through a local service. \n\nMy friend and I first had a late Saturday lunch weeks back when weather still couldn't decide if it was was winter or spring.  For an appetizer we ordered the table side guacamole... the large portion.\n\nOur server arrived at our table with a cart containing all the ingredients (even a convenient tip jar prominently in front) and two, yes, two small avocados.  When I asked if this was the large portion, she merely nodded as if she didn't understand or didn't know.  $9.95 for this in which we were finished in moments each having about 5 scoops.\n\nYou would expect guacamole to be served with chips.  While we were presented with an initial serving and salsa, we were out of chips in no time having none for our remaining salsa.  We did finally get some more but no salsa making them kinda pointless after just moments.  When we did ask for more while waiting for our meal, they kindly obliged not bothering to note only the first two orders were complimentary tacking around $3 to the check without note.  I did complain to the manager noting we never got but one initial serving of salsa and had to use the first serving of chips for our meager guacamole appetizer.  He did offer to remove the charge taking our word as to the situation.\n\nI only wish there was an El Chico or Don Pablo's in the area as I've never been disappointed with those experiences.",0
323,"I have never eaten at a Quizno's before, so I cannot compare to that, but I give this restaurant a 5 out of 5 for a fast food style place because:\n\nStaff was freindly and wanted to make sure I had an ideal experience.\n\nThe facility was clean.\n\nThe food was quite Yummy in the Tummy, and priced appropriatley.  \n\nThe service was fast.",1
324,"Dissatisfied. I heard such great things about this place and low and behold, the food was bland. The egg salad sandwich was eggs and mayo, with no taste at all. The tomato basil soup was horrible, and the \""""garlic\"""" hummus had less flavor than my glass of water. I would not recommend.",0
325,"MEDIOCRE FOOD AND NOT MUCH ELSE\nIf we didn't have a $25 coupon, I would have probably said something. We went to the Outside Inn because it was close and it's related to Martini's, an establishment that we have had a favorable experience with.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty standard for the \""""Sports Bar with a Theme\"""" that pervades Las Vegas. That's not a bad thing at all. It's decorated with Fish and with Televisions. We were there on a Monday night and the MNF game was on so it was probably louder than it normally is, because it was loud (although not crowded, just reasonably attended.)\n\nThe menu looked decent, but the food was not very good. We got the ARTICHOKE SPINACH DIP which was actually good. It was the same kind of Artichoke Spinach dip that you find in most restaurants, but it did have some large artichoke hearts in it that were really nice. The chips they served with it were nothing special and the blue chips were quite bland.\n\nThe ONION RINGS were neutral. The portion was large and the breading was good and not too greasy. But the onions they used were very large which meant that the fluid inside the rings was very drippy. At first my girlfriend thought the liquid was grease and wouldn't eat them until I showed her it was just running from the large onions. The taste was fine but the way they were leaking they were not very enticing.\n\nMy girlfriend had a SALAD WITH SHRIMP and had some kind of tortilla chips on it. It was fine, but nothing special, that's for sure. Again, the portion was generous and the taste was fine, but that was it, it was just fine. We wouldn't order it again.\n\nFinally, I had the SALMON ON CEDAR PLANK. BLECH! I REALLY didn't like what the cedar did to the salmon. I like things cooked over wood coals (like mesquite and the like), but this did not sit well with my tastebuds at all. It was a mixture of smoke and chemical that I just couldn't eat so I didn't eat it. My girlfriend didn't eat it either, although that's because she has never liked fish on cedar. The baked potato was good so between all the appetizers and nibbling off my girlfriend's dish, I was full.\n\nWe are members of www.Restaurant.com and had purchased a $25 gift certificate (it was an \""""80% off\"""" deal on Restaurant.com and we bought the $25 which regularly sells for $10 for a sale price of $2). We had to buy $35 of food to get the $25 off which is why we had to order so much food. Had our total bill not been $10.99 (but $35.99) I would have discussed things with management about having the salmont taken off of the bill. But as it was there was enough to eat and we tipped the decent service on the original bill. \n\nOh, and one last peeve: when we showed them the Restaurant.com certificate we were told there were several restrictions including that we could not order their signature Fish and Chips. First of all, that is totally bad form. It is VERY easy for them to make those stipulations clear on Restaurant.com and it's underhanded to sell a gift certificate knowing that there's caveats but not making it clear until it is redeemed. Secondly, if we had had the Fish and Chips we probably wouldn't have been so disappointed and might have had an experience where we'd come back. But Karma has a way of biting one in the ass, and that's probably what occurred here. I just hope their Karma doesn't run over my Dogma, 'cause I'd have a real hard time explaining that one to my son.\n\nIn spite of this place being almost right around the corner from our home, we will probably not go back there again. We'd much rather go to Martini's which is closer, similarly laid out but much more upscale, and not much more expensive (except on their high end entrees.)",0
326,"The Bank nightclub in the Bellagio Hotel and Casino is one of the first and most respected clubs in the Las Vegas nightlife scene, and remains a favorite for tourists, VIPs, event celebrators and industry professionals. \n\nA night at The Bank can be described as a sensory overload, filling your ears with beats from music from famous DJs that you won't be able to resist dancing to, and the decor is accented with black and gold.

327,These people are very friendly and accommodating. The sushi is amazing. We get a lot of to go orders for a large group and they are always helpful and accurate on all our orders. This is definitely one of my favorite spots.,1
328,"For starters, the bar was awesome.  Very chic with great service and equally tasty drinks.  The snacks are very appropriate to get your palate ready.\n\nThen there was dinner with awesome music.  Rock during dinner was quite unique and not too loud as others have boasted.  The bread selection was divine and don't miss out on the Bavarian Pretzels - to die for.  Appies:  Steak Tartare, Butter Lettuce Avocado Salad and Big Eye Tuna (there were more I just lost consciousness after those).\n\nMeat - most of us had the American Waygu.  Amazing meat and cooked to perfection.  The sauces we ordered were a very nice addition to the meat.  Might want to just order a few as the flavors tend to get lost in the party.\n\nLastly, we had just about every dessert.  The Fuji Apple and the Strawberry shortcake were my favorites.  Hats off to the Chocolate Souffle as well - cooked to order and was spot on.  The service by our waiter along with Marino could not be matched.  I have dined at all of the Puck properties and this rates in the top 3 - maybe top 2.  Bring your wallet or expense account because perfection does have a pricetag.  If you are going to eat a fine meat meal once a year - this is the place regardless of the price.",1
329,"How could I ever thank you enough? All About Catering is far and away the BEST caterer I have ever seen. The compliments on the food and the staff are still pouring in, I could not be more impressed. The first time I tasted their food I knew they were amazing at what they do, then at the actual event they went above and beyond my expectations. Also every time I called or emailed them I got a response immediately which was very helpful. Not only are the staff friendly and professional the food is 5 stars!",1
330,"This place is so over rated.  It started off pretty crappy for the fact that I was charged $15/per day resort fee, which I was not aware of.  I know it's not much, but if you are staying there for almost a week, it's pretty costly.  \nThey didn't have a King size bed either...  Then they promised us a room with a great view- which was not very impressive.  \nOrder anything through room servie- expect to wait--- let's say FOREVER.\nBut I guess that's what I get for staying at MGM instead of somewhere like Bellagios...  The crowd at the hotel is a very odd mix as well... But I guess you get what you pay for...\n\nI wouldn't go back here and I would not recommend this place...",0
331,"What can I say!!  I have been there once and haven't been back.  After shelling out over $170 I better be damn satisfied.  But I was not!  I have mentioned my frugality in other reviews and when I shell out a lot of money it better be worth it otherwise I really am critical of the place.\n\nFirst, when I ordered spring water they brought out bottles of Fiji and charged me ten dollars per bottle.  Don't get me wrong I love Fiji water, but a ten damn dollars for a 2 dollar bottle of Fiji.  I work in the hospitality industry and I am shocked by their mark up.  \n\nSecond, when I order a $50 dollar steak it better be fantastic.  But I had better steaks from Chili's or any other similar knock off restaurant.  \n\nThird, the sides were bland I had a Caesar side salad and dis-liked it.  Although that was my fault because I forgot to realize that a authentic Caesar side salad will have anchovies.  The other side that came with the steak was fingerling potatoes which were not fully cooked and unsalted.  I have mentioned my fancy for potatoes in other reviews (especially french fries) so I was very disappointed when I tasted them.  I can prepare them so many different ways that they would knock your socks off and I have never attended any culinary institute.  So when professionally trained chefs can't do better than a Food Network trained cook there is something wrong with that.  But them the breaks.\n\nI will admit the service was great, but that can't make up for $170 sub par meal.  So if you are downtown and want a great steak skip Kincaid's and go to Durant's where they have servers wandering around always refilling your glass with Evian water for FREE and the food is insanely delicious.  That's what I do!!!",0
332,My wife and I love to come here. I'm giving this place a 4 star only because the last two times the service wasn't as good. As for the food I have zero complaints and their salmon is by far my favorite in the valley!,1
333,"Just ate here for the first time, and I gotta say, I'm disappointed with all the hype I've heard. First, the romaine in my salad was brown on the ends so it obviously wasn't fresh. Second, my soup and bread bowl came out colder than room temperature and I had to send it back, which I hate doing being a server myself. Third, we told our server, skinny girl with long black hair and purple on top that our parking meter was about to run out so we needed our check. She walked past us again a few minutes later with no check, said nothing, and then another couple of minutes later we see her seating a party of twenty and taking all of their drink orders! Get out of here!! I had to leave the table and go pull the car out while my boyfriend waited for our check another 10 minutes. UNREAL! We still left almost 20%, but I hope she realizes she missed out on the usual 30-40% we normally leave both being servers ourselves. Lastly, a little too pricy for what you get. Don't think we'll be back.",0
334,"Stopped in here a few months back.  Walking into the store it is very bright with florescent lights that made me feel like I was in an episode of twilight zone.  Not that I need to feel like I am at a 5 star resort but the lighting in here is jarring.\n\nThe staff was a little to eager.  One woman followed me around and kept trying to offer helpful suggestions \""""all you have to do is ask\""""....Uh thanks but I think I got this all figured out.  Tried to make as little eye contact on checkout and the cashier kept saying creapy shit like \""""well I know you'll be back\"""".  \n\nDo people walk into adult stores and ask for help and recommendations?

It was a big mess of a job that was done to my dress and was told by the lady it doesn't look bad this far away as she is 5 ft away from me. Save yourself money and stress and take it somewhere else.",0
336,"I had high hopes for this place since it's within my pants radius (that is, the distance I'm comfortable traveling from my apartment without feeling like I really need to put effort into getting dressed.)  I think it just opened within the last couple weeks, so I stopped in on Wednesday after I got back from an out of town trip & didn't feel like making dinner.  I just got a basic chicken burrito, no beans, add guac.  \n\nMy issues:\n-- The tortilla.  This is supposed to be their big selling point, but it's nothing like a real tortilla.  Yes, they press and cook it fresh in front of you.  The one I received was chewy almost to the point of being gummy.  I was not impressed.   \n-- The flavors.  I filled my burrito with marinated chicken, pico, hot salsa, lettuce and guacamole.  None of it had any distinct flavor, nor did the salsa have any kick.  \n\nOn top of that, there were several employees just standing around while I waited.  When one finally decided to help me, he had to ask what meat I wanted three times since he wasn't paying attention the first two.  My tortilla ripped while they were trying to roll my burrito so they transferred 3/4 of the contents into a new tortilla.  The rest were thrown away with the old tortilla so a quarter of my burrito was lost.  I know I'm being nit-picky here, but nothing seemed to go smoothly.\n\nIn general, I just was not impressed.  I'll keep driving the extra mile to Chipotle.",0
337,"I had heard a lot about Flancer's from the \""""Mouth by Southwest\"""" blog and was interested to try it.  I had heard of multiple tap takeovers and other events so I was excited to see what beers they had on tap.  All that stuff must have been at the other Flancer's location, because this location didn't look like it even had taps or a bar.  My husband ordered an imperial IPA from New Belgium that he thought was pretty good (in a bottle) and I ordered the prickly pear spiked lemonade.  There was not much prickly pear flavor, but you could tell the lemonade itself was fresh squeezed.  \n\nThe sandwiches were the real highlight of our visit.  I got a sandwich with pork, arugula, tomato relish and onions.  It was amazing!  The bread was incredibly soft, but it still had a chewy outer coating so the sandwich didn't fall apart.  My husband got the Philly and he really liked it.  He is very hard to please when it comes to Philly sandwiches.  He was a huge fan of the bread.  I really liked the green chili mac and cheese too.  The jalape\u00f1o mashed potatoes were insanely hot, but if you're into that, they are right up your alley.  I would love to try more of Flancer's sandwiches!",1

341,"Wow.  Just... wow.\n\nLocated in an old 19th century farm house in semi-rural Conestoga, Rumbletum might be the nicest looking, coziest cafe / gift shop I've ever set foot in anywhere on the planet.  I went there for a boardgame event with 25 other geeks... most of these geeks are used to playing games in less-than-beautiful surroundings, and really don't care about a venue's appearance.  Still, many of them were simply blown away by Rumbletum.\n\nThe owners, Quinn and Heidi, are friendly and personable, the sort that want to see you happy.  This is a refreshing change from the jaded, stand-offish service I'm becoming accustomed to in many Toronto shops.  \n\nIt is mostly Heidi's shop -- Quinn contributes boardgame goodness at deeply discounted prices -- and her background as a graphic artist really shines through, from the meticulously scripted chalkboard menus to the quaint and quirky bathroom product display... in an actual bathroom.\n\nIt's difficult for me to really classify Rumbletum in terms of its gift offerings, but home decor and art really seem to be the focus, with all manner of eclectic giftware to be found in nooks and crannies throughout the house.  This really is a shopping experience, where you can completely lose track of both time and purpose as you poke about and marvel at all the little goodies there are to find.\n\nAs for the cafe side of things, damned if they don't make an assortment of ridiculously tasty grilled sandwiches (the veggie is divine!  $7ish as I recall), some killer chocolate chip cookies (85cents!), and a rather nice cup of java (with lots of choices that range from about $2-$4).  \n\nI didn't sample their other baked goods, but they looked rather epic -- the cakes in particular were begging to make me fat again.  Finally, they offer up loose leaf teas, a seasonal soup, milk shakes, smoothies, and ice cream to round out a focused, comforting menu that ties nicely to the space itself.  It's kind of like eating in your slightly oddball aunt's old house -- if your aunt was a graphic artist wanting to sell you amusingly offensive silk-screened toilet paper.\n\nIn any case, I'll sum up Rumbletum thusly:\n\n1)  Gorgeous.\n2)  Tasty sandwiches and a good cup of joe.\n3)  Easy to spend two hours poking about a really cool boutique.\n4)  Local flavour and cool people.\n5)  Boardgames for sale.  Criminally cheap.\n\n5 stars.  I was blown away.",1
342,"This place is a joke. The bread was cold and they only gave us one cup of butter for 4 people to share. We had to ask 3 times for extra butter. The \""""medium rare\"""" prime rib was mostly medium in the middle and was too tough to eat. The garlic mashed potatoes were not even hot when they came out and already had a stale film on the exterior. The service was appalling. I had to beg for refills and the check. I will never come back here.",0
343,Jason is very friendly and genuinely helpful when answering all the questions I have on insurance. \n\nI don't typically enjoy talking with insurance people because they usually are trying to over sell me on something and not really listening to my needs. Jason was great to talk with at length because he was non pushy and didn't dodge around topics I needed answers on.\n\nI continue to rely on Jason and you should to.,1
344,"I rarely go to a new place without \""""yelping\"""" it but Bandera was closed for lunch.  So we rolled the dice to find a really great lunch. Service was excellent, atmosphere was casual and relaxed.  Half price wine on Tuesday.  Food was great.  We split Ahi Tuna tacos then a blue cheese burger.  LOVE jicama tortillas and the sweet potato tots with a hint of salty cheese on them... worth the trip!",1
345,"We decided to stop in during a recent trip to Vegas after seeing the dinner in the show Hungry Investors. I must admit, the food was amazing and just as the show highlighted the service was slow. This lil dinner could easily be 5 stars if they had better service. I had the prime Benedict and the wide had the traditional, both were absolutely amazing. Even with the chaotic service I still have to admit this was a great stop.",1
346,"We went here, and had not only terrible food, but terrible service.  It was their \""""Grand Opening\"""" week-end.  The only steak they had left was NY Strip, so that is what we ordered.  We also ordered Calamari that had a great description, but when she took the salads away, and brought our steaks, she mentioned that the calamari would be out in a minute.  I said since we have waited over 20 minutes; don't bother, it was supposed to be an appetizer.  \n\nCut into our steaks, that were black on the outside and purple in the middle.  At this point I am beyond frustrated, and told her we would like to pay for our drinks and salad, and we will go.  She brought the bill, took $10 off and the calamari was still on the bill as well.\n\nI asked for a manager, and after 10 minutes no one came to the table.  I went to the register and asked if the gal could please allow me to just pay for the drinks and salad.  She said \""""I guess so.\""""  I saw the waitress after we had finally squared away on the bill, and told her that my tip to her was to work someplace else if she wanted to make money.  \n\nBesides being slow, and seemingly uncaring, I felt that the management has a bit of growth to make this successful.  How do you run out of steaks on your grand opening, especially knowing the Rodeo and Homecoming were also this week-end???  \n\nHasn't been a good restaurant in there since Sangini's (sp?)  was closed!!",0
347,"Went here for my birthday this past weekend and had a great time!\nIt was industry night plus there was a tattoo convention in town. \nNeedless to say the crowd was super hot!\n\nThe decor is chic, very Vegas, but unlike any other Vegas nightclub I have been in. \nThe VIP girls are hot and friendly, and there is no line for the bathroom.  That is as good as it gets when it comes to night clubs!\n\nThe huge downer, drinks are seriously like $20 for a sky & cranberry.\nWe had a couple of bottles so we were not really effects by the price. however I doubt I would ever go here for just drinks after finding that out. \n\nI know its Vegas, but seriously that is just plain crazy, and everyone who pays that is just plan crazy!",1
348,"Brasserie K. What to say? Let's start with it would have been acceptable at less than 2 thirds the price, maybe half. So you can tell where this is going.\n\nLet's start with the Chef: Charles-Antoine Cr\u00eate. He represents pretty much all my pet-peeves about my Qu\u00e9becois culture. He's unable to master the language and talks like what as a kid we called \""""Farmers\"""" (Turned out we were wrong as most are better educated than the urban folks) by using the basest Joual vulgarities. There's a difference between the word FOOD and the word MEAL, but this is lost on him. Plus his table etiquette is ridiculously missing from a man who everyone seems to consider a great chef. There's a way to holding a spoon my friends. Then there's his condescending behaviour with even his family and friends when he's on TV shows such as l'\u00c9picerie on Radio-Canada.\n\nThe Restaurant: Hip and modern in tight quarters but it works. However when I'm paying over 100$ for an average meal I could easily dish out in my tinny apartment kitchen, I expect to sit on more than 10$ patio chairs from R\u00e9no-D\u00e9pot. \n\nThe Service: The service was fantastic, can't complain. Our waitress, very beautiful and shapely (but that's just me) could have forgone her fake French accent and since we weren't from the \""""In Crowd\"""" we did get treated to some look-downs.\n\nBut I can look over a vulgar chef, stupid patio chairs and snobby service... if the food was mind-blowing, but it ain't, let's get this straight, we are talking very ordinary pub grub here. I love gastro-pub, just not this one.\n\nFirst off I really wanted those parmesan fondues. This was a flashback to the glorious 80s... I was hoping from something tweaked or upgraded, but no, just ordinary parmesan fondues, basically fresh made cheese sticks you can get at any restaurant these days. Although, the tomato sauce accompaniment was really good.\n\nThis was followed by the only awesome part of the meal, the Foie Gras plate. This way to pricy portion of Foie Gras was delicious but let's faces it. Foie Gras is hard to fuck up. Salt, pan sear it and just don't overcook it, that's it. So it hardly requires much know-how.\n\nAs the main I ordered the bavette, a gastro-pub staple if you will. This was the weirdest looking bavette I've ever had and tasted like regular sirloin, not the hardier piece of meat it's supposed to be. The pat of homemade butter was horrible and the fries - while really amazing - filled up three quarters of my plate. Fries cost NOTHING to produce; I'm confused as to the price of my plate for this very reason.\n\nThe desert, a profiterole another throwback to the 80s was indeed very delicious, worth it and saved this experience from total damnation. \n\nAll in all, the food wasn't horrible; it was good, but seriously overpriced for what I received while sitting on PVC patio furniture. Pricey enough for me to not return. For the same price and for gastro-pub that is supremely better, just head on over to Taverne Square Dominion on Metcalf. They also have one of the best, if not the best bar in town.",0
349,Cool bar with respect to televisions and space and... That's the end of the positives. The food is sub par... Chicken and burgers tasted like they were frozen (processed and very fatty) and the cole slaw so soggy it wasn't edible. Even the salad was bad with lots of rusty lettuce. No reason for any of this... As soon as a real restaurant at talking stick opens this place is done. Oh and the service is terrible... Took 45 minutes for 2 frozen entrees. You have been warned.,0
350,"I love their smoothies, but unfortunately they have no customer service skills. I went in with my sister after our workout and they were taking forever to make our drinks and then my sis thought her drink was ready and it wasn't...it was \""""the managers\"""" drink. They need someone with good management skills to run that place.",0
351,I took the tour here with some friends and we were blown away with the fun and great spirits to taste. We learned a lot about the history of AZ spirits and culture. I totally recommend this to any group of friends to do.,1
352,be very very careful there playing - craps yesterday and a hooker showed up and started trying to be friendly and rubbing against me.  i told her no thanks and when she persisted so much the entire table told her to go...i went to a pit boss ms. urban (i think that was her name - dark haired and stocky) and she told me only to watch my chips and called security but they were taking  a while - really?  since when i security slow in a casino.  on top of all that 10 minutes later the hooker was still there and another casino pit boss showed up and i only had to mention that i really didn't want this woman near me and he walked over to her and told her to leave.  this after 15 minutes of the rest of the crew not doing a damn thing.  \n\ni would be very very careful about going back there.  i was actually concerned about safety as was the rest of the table as 50% of us just cashed out and left.  \n\nit put a bad taste in all our mouths.  sickening.,0
353,"I found this place on Yelp and decided to try it based on the reviews. I took my boyfriend and a couple of friends for breakfast. Amazing service, amazing food!!!! I got the truffled egg sandwich without the bread and my boyfriend got the shrimp and grits. Both dishes were mind blowing. \n\nThis is in a not so nice area of downtown and is a fantastic little gem. I'm hoping to go back tomorrow for breakfast before we fly home. Their lunch menu looks great too!! \n\nA couple of tips: they don't split checks when they're busy and they only seat complete parties.",1
354,"The first fell on a Friday and I couldn't make it to their office till Monday to drop the rent check...they said I had to pay a late fee.  Totally ridiculous, we pay are rent on time every month and only are renting a home because ours sold so quickly and needed time to find a new home (which we have now), so we will be moving.  I hopefully will be able to get in touch with the owner of the property and let them know what a terrible property management company this is.  I would recommend sleeping in your car before renting from them.",0
355,"\""""See her before she blows!, ow wait she already does!\"""" \n\nI went to this hotel because it was the cheapest hotel close enough to the strip at a reasonable price, granted we didn't do alot of investigating before we went here, so that was pretty much our fault. So in the end it boiled down to price and enough available rooms. We checked in after having reserved our room on the drive towards Vegas, upon getting there we were automatically turned off by this hotels overall presence. The parking was confusing and there was no one to guide us through the maze in which we found ourselves driving. Finally we parked in this industrial mall style parking structure and checked in. We were forced t wait as our rooms were being cleaned and 20 mins later we were given our keys and told what elevator to take, apparently our party was split 4 of us were forced into a smoking room (more like smoking floor, it was truly horrific) that was just about soaked in smoke, it was as if the maid had forgot to use air sprays either that or the smoke was so strong the spray didn't even stand a chance. Our other party was on another floor only accessible through its own separate elevator. That alone was a huge inconvenience, we ended up going back and forth several times until we had had enough. We complained and eventually, 1 and a half days into our 3 day weekend, our both party's were placed on the same smoking floor. Apparently non smoking rooms are requested more, as it is a hotel geared more towards those with kids. As if that was not bad enough the view from the room was horrific, all you see is the sad gray roof down below of and the parking garage in the distance. The hallways had missing segments of the ceiling, which showed off the buildings rusting water pipes. Which only deterred us from drinking any of the tap water or from showering in excess. \n\nAs for the amenities, seeing as how I was 20 when I went on this trip I was not allowed to enjoy the gambling experience while in Vegas, therefore I can not really comment on this. However my friends that did end up gambling at the hotel said it was \""""whatevers\"""", the drinks were alittle on the light side and the games just didn't seem \""""lucky\"""". On the opposite end of the casino level lies the \""""The Buffet\"""", now no Vegas hotel would be complete without a Buffet and the Circus Circus is no different however don't go into \""""The Buffet\"""" expecting a 5 star gourmet dining experience, in fact don't even expect a 2 star dining experience. Overall the food choices were varied from American cuisine to Italian to even Mexican, however the quality was about as great as any \""""Home Town Buffet\"""" and if you've ever been to one you know what I mean. The food lacked flavor and was designed for a bland American palate, my friends had to cover their food in salsa and salt just to make it worth eating. If you do decide to eat here go during breakfast as it seems to be when they serve their better prepared options. Yet how difficult is it to scramble an egg and heat up some pre-made sausage, not very I'd assume. \n\nIn the end the Circus Circus is a good hotel to see if your traveling with Children. Its also great if you want to see an old classic before the dynamite is called in. However do not fear when that day does come there are still plenty of great hotels I'd suggest for parents, \""""Mandalay Bay\"""", \""""Excalibur\"""" or \""""Treasure Island\"""" all 3 themed hotels offer afew more options then \""""Circus\"""" and aren't as \""""aged\"""". As for booking plan in advance and seek out promotional offers on-line (found 3 when I got back home, which could have saved us about 112.00 [each room].....darn!) Also always request non smoking rooms close to each other or gathering your party might end up a daily rusense. The buffets okay in the morning and around brunch time but avoid the dinner menu, its your chance to sample what you missed if you would have stayed at the \""""Hard Rock\"""" (GREAT FOOD, awesome adult atmosphere). In the end I CAN NOT recommend this decrepit old building. The whole stay felt very depressing and the staff came off unfriendly and uncaring really. Getting an extra 30 mins to leave our room was a HUGE issue, they wanted to charge for an additional day (on both rooms). If your staying here I'd recommend booking someplace else, this hotel is on its way out the door. Ow and its not even THAT close to the strip, about something like 1-2 miles away. Walking from Circus to Mandalay bay was grueling and in the end we were forced to get a taxi.",0
356,"I made a reservation for my best friend's bachelorette party!\n\nWe had a group of nine girls, and the management made us feel special from the beginning.\nWe were greeted by the manager and lead to the chef's table with a gorgeous view of the strip.

My overall message to future gun and ammo buyers is to shop around. \nHowever, if you have out of state friends or out of country friends, that  want to enjoy target practice, they could have some fun with the shooting experience at this attraction.

358,"This place is the worst. \nOf course, it's beautiful and has a great selection of books...so long as you don't mind living under the most tyrannical librarian regime ever to live. \nEvery time I walk into this library, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells wondering what rule I might break next.

Who the hell are these librarians to tell people how they need to sit or wear their shoes? \nAnd the children's librarians are not friendly or nice with the kids, but generally seem annoyed that anyone is even there.

362,"This is a great place. \n\nThey run amazing deals like GroupOn $5 for a movie ticket and soda (I don't recommend anyone drinks soda with HFCS), but I digress. They also have charity days where you can bring in a canned food item for free admission. \n\nNow, down to the nitty gritty. Nice theatre, much better than most brew and views I've been to. The seats could be more comfortable, they recline but then they bounce right back. The other seating is just like your computer office desk at home. The food is hit or miss. They failed to declare that the grilled cheese is actually more like american plastic cheese sandwich. The other food was good, but the service is rather fail. Ordered the 4 appetizer combo, and they came out with three items. Yet again no apologies, what is with service these days? \n\nThe screens are great and just like a regular movie theatre, it just sucks when they fail to dim the lights until half way through the movie. It makes the 3D glasses reflect like crazy. Overall it's worth a go, a bit pricy (for the food/drinks) but enjoyable none the less. I just bought 10 movie passes on GroupOn. Oh Yeah.",1

371,"\""""The New\"""" How Lee is a great example of just how much the food scene in Pittsburgh has developed and grown over the past decade.

The noodles were pleasantly chewy and luxuriously bathed in the sesame-rich sauce studded with bits of ground pork. The eggplant had a tinge of sweetness nicely countered by the sharp garlic and swirls of chili oil. The prawns were dry-fried with several cups of dried chilis. The fresh sweetness of the shrimp balanced perfectly with the saltiness and spice of its seasonings.\n\nThe service was friendly and prompt, and our server checked on us several times to make sure we were pleased with our meal and to see if we needed anything further.\n\nThe New How Lee is a wonderful addition to the Squirrel Hill food scene and I'd be more than happy to dine there again.",1

377,"Matt and I dined here for our Christmas Eve dinner. Since this was the first time I didn't make the trip home to San Francisco for Christmas, I had absolutely no idea what to do with my Christmas Eve. Matt and I need plans! Therefore, after doing some investigative work on the internet as to what Arizonians can do in Phoenix on Christmas Eve, I came across PCG and their special menu for the holiday. Their prime rib and sea bass specials looked mouthwatering so I made reservations. In the end, this place did not disappoint!! I will unquestionably be back. \n\nI started out with a strong and tart pomegranate margarita that wasn't too sweet. I don't like it when margaritas are sugary so this one was perfect, and a great way to get my Christmas festivities started. \n\nFor my main course I opted to try the sea bass special. It came with almond crusted asparagus and some garlicky (and insanely buttery) rosemary mashed potatoes. How would I describe the entire meal? In one word, perfection! That sea bass was so fresh and delicious it practically swam right up to my plate. You can't really go wrong with asparagus but this wasn't just your regular vegetable. They coated the asparagus with a crunchy layer of almonds and it was soooooo tasty. And yeah, the mashed potatoes tasted like they had about 5 cubes of butter in them... but that's the best way to make em!\n\nI wish I had known about this place sooner because it really is such a delightful restaurant. The atmosphere isn't too lively but it isn't too dull. Tons of families, friends and large groups filled the interior so PCG really suits any age demographic. I loved the decorations that they had up for Christmas, and I highly recommend dining here for any holiday. They really do an all around excellent job at providing an awesome dining experience. \n\nWhen I was there I also noticed that they have a really nice bar with an even nicer happy hour... so once I get the chance, I'm going to head right back here and try it out! Everyone in AZ needs to know about this place. It's one of those solid classic restaurants you can go to for pretty much any occasion. 5 stars to PCG!",1
378,Ok. For all of you who is wondering if EDC in LAS VEGAS is better then when it was held in Los Angeles. In my opinion: HELL YES. It was well worth it.

Its not easy to manage an event this massive. Anyways. Here are the pros and cons to this years event:\n\nPROS: \n\nA lot of space for dancing. Love it. Las Vegas speedway is a huge place. Everything is pretty much open. You don't feel like you are shoulder to shoulder having a hard time trying to get through crowds just to get to the other side. Since it's an +18 event everyone's legal and no more under age kids to kill my high. YAY! awesome DJ lineup. Swedish house mafia killed it. Entrance and parking was a breeze for us. Because We made sure not to arrive when the event started. best thing I love about the event. Was that it was in Vegas. what better place to end the party with another party back at the hotel suite off the strip?? My point exactly. \n\nCONS:\n\nIs the dirt floor. Filled with rocks. Very hard to dance on. But you would only had to worry about this at the main stage. everything else was pretty much concrete.\nRestrooms. Their were plenty of Port-a-potties. But not a single bathroom open to the public to wash your hands at. The weather was a little warm. But not as hot as you would think it would be since it was Vegas. It was actually pretty nice as the night grew later. Oh and the bleachers were cut off from being use. So you don't really get that looking down at the crowd massive experience like you would when it was held at the Colosseum. But we can do without it. The walk to and from the car. But that's with every massive. \n\nBut Overall. Best EDC I've experienced so far. Definitely will be a next year. \n\nNote: Any place is only as good as the company you are with and I was with some awesome people. Therefore I had an awesome time.,1
379,"I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such \""""games\"""", you can't even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets.",0
380,"Screw this place.  I had a groupon for mani, pedi, and mini facial and I called to schedule it today (June 15) and she told me they are booked on weekends until August 6.  My groupon expires August 4 and she just said 'well, we're all booked, we can call if there's a cancellation.\""""  The next weekday appointment they had wasn't until July 8.  Ridiculous!",0
381,"One word describes this event; Pathetic. First problem is this bus station has no AC and the fan that they set up cools about an inch of the joint. Secondly, the place is cramped as hell and there is really only room for one-way traffic, but of course it goes both directions. The people selling stuff aren't friendly at all (some were texting, others were eating chips) and the samples that were laid out were wilting in the heat and I wouldn't recommend anybody risk their health with those gnarly samples. The produce was a joke, but that is what i expected in Las Vegas, not really a farming headquarters. $5 a scone, $6 for a loaf a bread you can fiind at Trader Joes, some juice place reusing the same blender for everyone's drinks. The only thing I tried was the Arizona tamale place which was way in the corner devoid of people and this was another ripff. I don't care if your tamale is organic, it shouldn't be 5 bucks, unless your hawking them at the Bellagio, not in the homeless shlter downtown. Organic tamales are nasty anyway, made by an old white couple. The only tamales I need to be purchasing are from the Mexican folks. The chicken and green chile was tasteless and just a few weeks ago, I had an incredible $2 green chile/cheese tamale in Santa Fe. The fun part is peeling the husk off, but these people do it for you - bad karma. It's a hot, sweaty mess overpriced inside that bus terminal and whoever reviews it otherwise must be nuts. Oh and all kinds of garbage, bums and discarded clothing really liven up the outside of the terminal. Loserville.",0
382,"I get up on the weekends and the first thing out of my mouth is \""""Can we go to Kashman's?\"""" The only reason I am giving it four starts versus 5 is that it is mostly outside seating. Now, for 1/2 of the year here, that is perfect, but for the summers, its just too hot! \n\nThere's a lot of food that comes with your order. The omletts are delicious, though! My husband comes out just for the coffee. While I always get the breakfast, he has ventured out and tried a few of the sandwiches, which he liked as well, but said he liked the breakfast more. \n\nBest thing about it is that pooch lovers get to bring their furry best friends along. I bring my poodle every time and he shares a breakfast. I don't feel guilty about leaving him at home. \n\nGreat, friendly staff, too!",1
383,"Amazing. Seriously, went there with 14 girl friends for a bachelorette party and were expecting a cheesy dance show. Cheesy, a bit, but hot, young, awesome guys, FOR SURE. We all agreed it was one of the best things we did all weekend. Well worth the money. My only complaint are the drinks, but whatever. The show itself was awesome. With a group of girls in Vegas for a bachelorette part, GO TO THIS SHOW!",1
384,"i use to think that there is no other place other than tea station. despite their horrible service, i still continued to buy my tea there. One day, i just couldnt stand it anymore, they had new people working and twice they made my drink wrong. when i have to pay $6 for my boba, it better be my money's worth. i have been ordering the wintermelon milk tea for 2 years and they now tell me that the drink does not exist. they poured milk into the wintermelon green tea that they mistakenly made for me. Of course it did not taste they way it was suppose to. i complained and they did not want to replace my drink until i got a bit furious with them. they ended up just making me a milk tea, which was delicious but i did not enjoy it, just for the fact that i initially wanted my wintermelon milk tea and what they put me through, just for a simple drink.",0
385,"I was at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort for a conference and I had paid for a booth in the Hohokam Ballroom for three days. During my stay my boothmate and I began receiving huge red itchy welts which were bug bites from insects in the ballroom. I went to the concierge who took me into the business center to speak with the manager Kyle King, who apologized and said he would immediately come down to the ballroom to assess the situation. Unfortunately nobody ever came to deal with the insect problem and we continued to receive bites and ended up with around a dozen bites each from our feet up to our knees. The bites were so itchy that they kept us both up at night for a week even while constantly applying medication. I later spoke with a nurse who said that they appeared to be flea bites and that the hotel needed to take action with the problem since flea bites can become infected from the feces fleas leave while on our skin and if they are scratched can lead to scarring.\n\nAfter the event, I called the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort and asked to speak to a manager about this issue. Nobody would connect me to a manager and asked why I needed to speak to a manager in the first place. I explained what had happened during my stay on the property and was told they would find the manager Kyle King I had spoken with and connect me to him. I was put on hold for more than ten minutes and then was told I was going to be connected to the Director of Security, who told me he would get Kyle King's contact information and call me back with that information so I could e-mail photographs of the bug bites I received from my stay on the property. The Director of Security called me back and said his boss wouldn't allow him to give me a managers contact information.\n\nAfter this I e-mailed the resort and was told that since I didn't pay to stay in a hotel room and only paid to stay in the Hohokam Ballroom that they couldn't do anything about it even though this happened on their property and they did nothing about it. And speaking of rooms, I later was informed that some individuals that stayed in hotel rooms on the property during the same time had issues with ants swarming in their rooms which ended up getting into their luggage.\n\nOverall I think it is ridiculous that the hotel wouldn't do anything about the bugs and also that nobody would let me speak to a manager when I had a complaint. I expected a clean and safe environment to be in at the resort, but the resort has bug problems in several different areas which need to be attended to for the safety and health of the guests.",0
386,"I went May 24th. to May 28th. All I can say is \""""This Will Be My Place To Go When I Do Vegas\"""" Period!

387,"Jane Kinney did my wedding flowers. I did not care about the flowers at my wedding as much as other details, so I went very minimalistic. Jane did not do anything super creative for my wedding, but she executed what I asked her to do and I thought it was beautiful. She made great suggestions to me, a person who doesn't know a tulip from a lilac. She also helped with season-appropriate flowers and was very professional to work with. She was disappointed when she arrived and could not help us set up because the tables were not set up. I enjoyed working with Jane and found her prices to be extremely reasonable. She was also able to incorporate pieces of the extra fabric from my dress to wrap my bouquet. It was beautiful. \n\nIf you pay in cash or check, she throws in something free like an extra toss bouquet or something of the sort.",1

390,Since I can not review the online store I will post my review here. I used RTR to rent a gown for a formal wedding. I received 2 gowns in less than favorable condition. The size 6 gown had the lining ripped so terribly that I could not even try the gown on with out fear of completely destroying the gown. The size 4 gown was also had what appeared to be a misshaped torso area which gave me a terrible stomach pooch. These dresses were obviously worn by ladies that were to large for these items and they are destroyed. I am now flying to Chicago with out a gown for a formal event and will be purchasing a gown to wear 1 time in Chicago. I feel as if the way this gowns are cared for is atrocious and RTR either has some Quality Control Issues or a blatant disregard for their customers. Also ladies please buy measuring tapes so that you do not destroy a garment that others may wear.,0
391,"LOVED this place!  Had everything from fruits to hummus, to mac & cheese station to the Sushi station.  The desserts are just the cherry on the cake too.  Service was excellent.  It is pricey but I brought a group of girls here before a long night out partying and I'd starved them all day.  It was worth it.  It was nice having smaller portion foods and the variety.  We'll definitely come back again",1
392,"Horrible place.  I threw a party for work in Vegas and had to get some brochures printed here.  I will never use this place again.  They over charged, provided poor quality printing services and wouldn't refund us for their bad work.  \n\nThese people changed out the expensive paper I asked for with cheap paper and tried to tell me that no one could tell the difference anyway.  Well, I paid for the expensive paper and I could tell the difference and so could our clients.\n\nI'll go anywhere but here in the future.",0
393,My wife and I both had the HK tasting menu which at first I thought might be a little over priced but I was wrong!

Was in the mood for Chinese and was actually on the way to another spot when I saw this one on South blvd. and I am SO glad we did!! got the beef w/mixed veggies, side of lo mien, and egg drop soup, and it came with an egg roll! BF got wings, fried rice, just as yummy. total was only $16 and change. would highly recommend. They were open at 10 on a Thursday, empty in side, but the attendant was SUPER sweet.",1
395,Came here with my friend who was having problems with his laptop and they give a free 15 minute diagnosis.  The guys there were great and spent plenty of time making sure everything was okay on his computer and after testing it and finding nothing wrong.  He suggested the problem was probably internet related with my friends home service.  Turns out he was right and it cost us nothing which is way to generous in my opinion.  I had to come on here and Yelp about it.  The place isn't fancy and is in front of the bowling alley on the NE corner of 35ave & Union inside the strip mall.  Check it out if you have a chance and skip the Geek Squad!,1
396,"I usually love bk, this one is sub-par. I'm pretty sure they don't change their oil enough. I also received a much smaller double cheeseburger than I expected. The thing was kids sized. Bad value overall. They also shorted us on the cold-fries.",0
397,"Welcome to your classic Scottsdale dive bar. Upon entry, bar to the right, tables to your left. Towards the back you'll find arcade games, darts, TVs and a pool table too. The biggest selling point is the patio in the back that features several places to sit and opens up into the huge alley which doubles as a parking lot; triples as a restroom for some patrons. \n\nDrinks are cheap and the bartenders are always in good spirits. You'll meet some interesting folk here on any given night, so don't be afraid to crack open some conversation along with your beer. I can't think of a dive bar that I've frequented more in Scottsdale than Roadrunner.",1

399,My wife and I had been patients with this business since 2011-2013. I always had problems with there staff. They always tried  to bill for procedures they knew my insurance wouldn't cover over and over again. I would end up paying the co-insurance considerably higher from what they originally quoted me. \n\n    Ultimately the decision for my wife and I to leave came when she was scheduled for a filling. After the procedure as she was driving home my wife noticed a huge gash on her chin. This part of her chin was numb during the procedure so my wife never felt the dentist literally take a gash out of her face. \n\n    They never said a word to my wife after she left. I hate seeing bad reviews as most of the time it's from people that seem to be rejected food critics but with this business I have to get the word out that they lied to us and were downright unprofessional.,0
400,"After checking out a laser show, rainstorm, the fountains and almost all the stores at Miracle Mile, it's time for tea.\n\nWe needed change and it had started raining outside.  I like Coffee Bean's Japanese Cherry and was amused to discover you can follow them on Twitter and Facebook.  What could a coffee shop possibly have to say?  I was curious to find them and check it out but disappointed that my tea was made wrong.  The water was poured boiled hot which scorched the tea bag making my tea bitter. I drank some of it anyway because it was getting really cold in Vegas and we had to leave the shops soon for our next adventure.",0
401,"Hmmm...Im not sure what all the rave reviews are about...\nMy husband & I went to Vegas after he returned from a 9 month deployment.  Before our trip, I went online and searched for all the must-do & bargain deals that Vegas offered.  Luv-It Frozen Custard was recommended.  I'd have to say that even before our trip began, I was more looking forward to going to this place than going anywhere else because I LOVE frozen treats.  We couldn't go during the first two days but on the third, when my husband found out that there was a Star Trek convention at the Hilton Hotel, I waved goodbye to him and eagerly made my way to this place.  In my mind, I was going to get Cold Stones portion of the most savory custard and I wasn't going to have to share any of it with my husband...\nWell, when I rounded the corner to this place, I knew I might be in for a let down...just the ambiance of the surrounding neighborhood.  I actually missed the store and had to turn around.  \nWhen I finally got to the parking area, I was surprised because I thought it was a shop that I would be able to walk in to, see the various custards, and pick the one that I wanted.  Instead, I was faced with just a guy hanging his head out the window, asking me what I would like.  \nI ended up getting chocolate chip.  I was unimpressed.  I thought it would come in a cone but he gave me a scoop of it in a styrofoam cup.   The portions were so tiny!  The size...not what I imagined.  The taste...also not what I imagined.  It was like eating soft ice cream.  The price...EQUALLY unimpressive.  How can you call a scoop of ice cream for about $5(?) cheap?  \nI tell you, this place IS NOT a hidden gem.  It may be hidden but it's no gem.  You'll be better off getting your frozen treat from somewhere else like Jean Philippe Patisserie at Bellagio.  You're spending about the same amount of money for more gelato, and you'll get to enjoy it at the Bellagio!  (((I love Bellagio...)))\nAfter the convention, my husband asked me if I wanted to go to Luv-It's now, not knowing that I went without him...I said NO! \nI'm telling you, save your money!  It's just not worth it!",0
402,OMG yummy. My husband and I love Indian food but have been hard pressed to find a good one in our area. Or search is over! Fusion has a wonderful selection of curries and beautiful fresh naan.

I did, unfortunately, have one bad experience with the woman they have working there Mon, Tues, Wed. mornings, she was not pleasent or welcoming in any sort of way, and honestly made me feel like I was rather inconveniencing her by being there. I was SO shocked by the whole experience since I've been going in pretty regularly for a couple months now and had never had anything negative to say, until then. I remember thinking, \""""Geez, I sure hope that's NOT Barb, and if it is, perhaps she's best suited for strictly baking...in the back...as far away from customers as possible!\"""" LOL\n\nSo, I do definitely recommend Barb's for cake and cookie lovers alike, you will DEFINITELY score big points with friends, family and co-workers!!

415,"First off, I LOVE Pita Jungle food and experience.  This location continues to slide in quality and service, however, to the point it's now on the \""""no-go\"""" list. :(\n\nWe went in about 3 months ago, and the service was dismissive and curt.  The food was lacking in the normally consistent high quality.  But, we took it as a bad day, and went back yesterday.  Again, we love the food. :)\n\nHowever, this day confirms the place is off the mark entirely.  We ordered the appetizer platter...food was good, however, the pita's were clearly microwaved, and therefore, got hard as a rock before you could finish it.  Fresh is no longer the rule here, apparently. :(\n\nWe both had gyros, which were also lacking.  The meat was super salty - and BF agreed, which says a lot, since he favors food that is well-seasoned and isn't as salt-sensitive as I am.  My pita was also going stale by the time I was at the end of the wrap.\n\nLastly, the server totally mischarged my credit card.  She undercharged us $15 on a $30 lunch, and because I am honest to a fault, I brought it to her attention.  No apology, no great thanks, either.  She went off to recharge the card, muttering something about how she wanted to see what she did wrong.  I told her to just charge the card the remaining amount.  Instead, she brought me back a new slip for the actual total.  I asked her for the cancellation on the original slip, and she said it wasn't required.  Not sure why I have this niggling feeling I was double-charged.  \n\nRegardless, overall, a lousy experience,  We'll stick with the PJ at Fashion Square.",0

Even if you get \""""a little\"""" bit of spicy, which I stupidly let the waiter talk me into getting, it will be HOT.  This is apparently not the case for Street Noodle #2, which is fried shrimp, on top of egg noodles which are considerably drier, and less spicy.  \n\nEven with the unbearable burn in my mouth, I was able to enjoy the fried chicken.  The noodles, I couldn't finish:( \n\nRestaurant is dim and spacey, with a 50cent BYOB per head charge.",1
418,"When I have been there I am one of just a couple of non-Asian people there, so that is a good sign. I really like the kimchee tofu soup (soondubu) and the bulgogi. They also give you the little side dishes, which I really like. They soup comes out steaming hot in a stone bowl. One tip - don't take the tofu soup home to eat the next day. The tofu absorbs all the liquid and you will have a big hunk of spicy tofu.",1
419,"The Renaissance festival is a must visit at least once for the experience. It's fun to see everyone dressed up and in character. \nThe food was priced high as expected with any festival food. Parking is free but there traffic going there. Since the highway there is only two lanes, one of those is dedicated to entrance to the festival. Be sure to purchase tickets at your local Fry's grocery to save the extra bucks.",1
420,"Set off on a sunny Monday evening with an itison voucher in hand to give this place a whirl and we werent disappointed. On a arrival we were greeted by a very friendly waitress and the place itself was bright and modern. The menu for the voucher was similair to the main menu only excluding the mini mains, so I cannot comment on those. \n\nWe opted for:\n\nCold meze\n\nhumus, Shaksuka, Dolma, olives\n\nHot Meze\n\nCalamari, Sucuk, Spinach Borek\n\nNerellom Ascalese Arpeggio Sicilian wine\n\nEverything was really nice and the wine was reasonably priced. The stand out dishes that made us discuss a repeat visit were the calamari, humus, Shaksuka and Sucuk. Even the pita breads were really good. Wish I had taken some photos as everything was reallly nicely presented. \n\nCould not fault a dish from the hummous to the pitta breads, which normlly for me in meze/tapas etc theres something that is a bit weird or seems have come from a tin. Never a fan of eating anywhere around George Street as I seem to have had a lot of medicore and occassionally expensive meals, but this place is great.",1
421,"The Royal Yacht is a great place for most ages -- except perhaps the very young or the very old.\n\nWe visited a few weeks back on a sunny March Saturday as a family.  The audio tour for children is a must if you have any with you younger than 13 or so.  I was concerned that Dad & I would want to tour at a slower pace than our daughters (12 & 6) but for the most part there was plenty to keep them occupied as we examined photos, documents, artifacts, etc.\n\nMy favourite part of the tour is the many photos of the family.  As an American, I don't have strongly held emotional ties for or against the monarchy, but simply enjoyed the mementos of family.\n\n\nThe staff is outstanding -- friendly, knowledgeable without interfering in the enjoyment of the tour.\n\nIf you have time, The Royal Yacht Britannia is a great addition to your Edinburgh itinerary.",1
422,"It's a shame that this place doesn't have better food. Chinese/Mexican concept is great because I'm a fan of both, but the execution just didn't work. The Dan Dan Mian didn't have much flavor other than an overwhelming taste of salt. The Gan Pung Ji chicken was dry, and the Lucky Sui Mai tasted like frozen dim sum that was simply heated. The only positive memory I have was that their guacamole was good. The ambience of the restaurant and its location inside the Cosmopolitan really has a lot of potential. If only the food didn't suck.",0
423,"Overall was very disappointed as on a previous stay we were at the Mirage and paid far less for a much nicer room.\n\nChecked in and were given a room on the 3rd floor, south side of the building. Room was clean but just had a dirty vibe. Window view was of a loading dock and there were water stains on the window coverings. Stopped at front desk later in the evening and was told to call after 11a for a new room. In the morning we were moved to the East side of the building, 11th floor. Room had a better view and wasn't as shabby. TVs were not flat screen in either and there is no wireless. Cell signal inside (ATT) was crappy too.\n\nCasino floor looked to have been updated - staff was friendly.\n\nThe inclined elevators are truly a marvel. Wish they had a see-thru one.\n\nPool area was clean and there are a lot of paid areas if you want a bit more privacy. DJ was spinning tunes starting at about 11a on Saturday.\n\nI'd stay here again for $39/nt but if you're paying hundreds like we did, spend a few more and stay elsewhere.",0
424,"We go to Arties all the time and have never had any issues and love it more now that they have a post office in the back, so we don't have to drive to the post office. It is a little cramped, but the staff has always been great in helping me find things. I also love the fact that I can take my dog. She loves to go in there but I won't take her during very busy times.",1
425,So sad to see another business go under. I went yesterday to get my car washed and after filling with gas and waiting for the attendant to start the wash I went to find out what the holdup was. I was then told the car wash was closed as they had been bought out by the bank. No signs anywhere to show car wash was closed. So sad.,0
426,"The Venetian is absolutely beautiful. The property is so huge you could get lost inside for days! The architectural and interior schemes of the casino-hotel are one-of-a-kind.\nFrom high end restaurants (Mario Batali & Wolfgang Puck as such) to the food court, anyone on a budget can eat at the Venetian.\n\nI have stayed at the Luxury Suites here, and it's one of the nicest rooms on the strip. How nice is the bathroom inside the luxury suite? As my good friend's girlfriend quoted, \"""" Phil, oh my gosh I could live inside this bathroom\"""".\n\nOnly gripe I have with this establishment is I am down like $2500 at the blackjack tables.

428,"So I thought reading their menu, seeing it in Chinese language and in the \nChinese District... it could be a real find -- I love dives with surprisingly good food.\n\n I was soooooo disappointed.\n\nThe egg drop soup was vegetable soup and just warm.  A minute after my soup\nwas served, my main course came out.  It had two items--pea pods and pork.  Not very BBQ flavor, rather a funny flavor.  No other veges such as water chestnuts or bamboo shoots.  The minimal sauce was very bland.  The rice was not fresh.",0
429,"I am basically a regular here.  Not only have I had may hair and make up done by them mnay times but they treated my girls to mani-pedi for their bday!

431,"This is one of my favorite Pizza places in town. Pizza is delicious and so are the chicken wings. I like the fact it feels like a family owned pizzeria not one of those commercial chain places. It's pretty cool when the actual Seattle Dan takes your order,  makes your order and delivers your order. Had nothing but great service everytime I order. I have and will continue to recommend Seattle Dan's for those looking for awesome Pizza.",1
432,"Mmmmmmm Mmmmm Mmm........ so good! I was skeptical about mach meats, but was pleasantly surprised by how delicious they were prepared. We ordered a couple of apps & 2 bowls to try. The apps were good, but my drunken mushroom \""""chicken\"""" was executed beautifully! The best part? The \""""TSoynami Clunky Monkey\"""" was a dessert that I couldn't stop moaning after every bite! Was that TMI?? Just imagine... Soy Ice Cream mixed with chunks of bananas, pecans, and chocolate drizzled throughout. Even if you eat too much and think you don't have room... don't miss this chance - make room!! You won't be sorry. \nOverall? Excellent! \nI am a fan and can't wait to try more on the menu!",1
433,This place was hands down the best bar I went to in the UK. The beer selection was great and the bartender was very knowledgeable. Ended up giving us the equivalent of a flight in samples before we choose our beers. The craft brews were exactly that - carefully crafted. Great flavour. I tend to like darker brews - porters and stouts - but even their light varieties had great taste. Just wish I had more time to come back and sample their seasonals!,1
434,"St John's is not your average church.  With a prime location right in the centre of town, at the West corner of Princes Street, it is at once a traditional centre of worship with an active Scottish Episcopal congregation, and also a hub for activism and progressive enterprise in Edinburgh.  \n\nHome to the Peace and Justice Centre and the ethical One World shop and also a Christian bookshop, which are all tucked around the side of the building, the church is also the primary venue for the Festival of Peace and Spirituality in August, which attracts speakers from all around the world for inter-faith dialogue.  There are also numerous concerts and talks held there throughout the year, and an occasional arts and crafts market that springs up on the terrace at the back.\n\nAll in all, St John's has plenty of interesting things to offer Christians and non-Christians alike.",1
435,"This is probably one of the best hotels I have stayed at ever, and I have been in some crazy hotels, from the Gritti Palace in Venice to the Plaza Athenee in Paris.  None however were as warm and welcoming as the Scots running this prime Edinburgh hotel. It might be a short schlep out of the centre of town, but pound-for-pound, compared to the likes of the Missoni it is one helluvalot better.\n\nI ended up here the marathon weekend over the summer, and was only able to book 1 night.  Having arrived, I told them I needed another night, and within a couple of hours they squirreled me out enjoying afternoon tea in one of their beautifully decorated reception rooms to inform me that there was another night available if I so desired.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped through the front door the staff made me feel as if I was a long lost friend returning home.  Their courtesy and warmth was impeccable, and delivered with traditional Scottish gusto. No doubt to \""""remind me of my English-ness\"""" they put me in the Churchill suite, and I wasn't disappointed in the den they had assigned me, which was super cosy and intimate.\n\nThe grounds are surrounded by a large golf course and there are plenty of good vantage points for Arthur's seat and beyond.  It's a quite and idyllic spot to be in, and all the more amazing considering that the bounds of central Edinburgh and not that far away, with everything it has to offer.  Edinburgh taxi drivers are certainly friendly!\n\nIf you are looking for a well-served, romantic weekend away, with excellent hospitaility, amazing restaurant (michelin-starred if I remember correctly) and great afternoon tea, then look no further than the Prestonfield House Hotel.",1
436,"I am a fan of amazing noodles and fun fusion dishes, so when a friend of mine told me about this place being his favorite joint and invited me to go, I jumped on it like white on rice. Noodles Ranch is located in the Bashas complex on Thomas and Scottsdale Rd. next to LoLo's! Twofer! I am so glad I can come to one place to get my foodie on hardcore. \n\nUpon walking up, nothing much to see, there are basic booths and tables with a casual Eastern theme going on. We sat in a booth and the owner said hello upon recognizing my friend from his innumerable visits there. I looked at the menu and gawked at the prices that are easy on the wallet... I then asked my buddy what he recommends. I like everything Vietnamese, so it's a tough call for me to choose. I was in the mood for a veggie dish of some sort. He said the Goi Ga was fantastic-- a cool, zesty chicken salad: shredded white meat with cabbage, carrot, mint, chopped peanut and chili lime dressing. I couldn't even look at anything else. Done. Ordered. My buddy ordered the Bun Thet Nuong: Grilled garlic pork and vermicelli along with veggies. They both arrived quickly. I could eat this salad every day. There is nothing wrong with it, it is c'est magnifique! Perfect combination of peanut and light citrus with fresh greens and plenty of chicken. The Bun was juicy and tender and rich in flavor. I wish I could order five dishes at one time here, but that seemed excessive.  \n\nI am excited to continue coming here for the prices, flavors and service! I hope it continues to flourish!",1
437,Well..I have to say I actually love this place but I was sad this evening when I went there for dinner but only to find it closed?!?  I found a sign on the door that says closed until a new permit is granted.  Not sure what happened.,0
438,"I've only been here once, but loved it!  \n\nIt definitely has the urban vibe. I had a hamburger with the hula sauce on the side - delish!  It was cooked perfectly with great flavor and served on yummy bun. Wish I could have eaten the whole thing, but it came with amazing sweet potato fries and I filled up on those.  Probably the best I've ever had!\n\nSeems like a great place for happy hour so I'll definitely be coming back for that.",1
439,"Driving in the area and hungry, I decided to give this place a try for lunch.  I looked at the menu on the wall and decided to order:\n\nCarne Asada Burrito, $5.59\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix?select=MfPA1uFY07lEvACv-o5CfQ#MfPA1uFY07lEvACv-o5CfQ\n\nBeans/Rice/Cheese Burrito, $2.98\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix?select=d-ovX_PN6CDCe7CUqOjLkg#d-ovX_PN6CDCe7CUqOjLkg\n\nThe service here was brutally slow.  The lady working the cash register could not multitask....it was agonizing.\n\nWhile waiting for my food, I went to the Salsa Bar to load up on Salsa.  Since I like spicy Salsa, I went for what appeared to be the spiciest one...turned out to be watered down, mild Gringo Juice...*bleh*.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramiros-mexican-food-phoenix?select=VxCnEw9so_M2z8KJR1-vBw#VxCnEw9so_M2z8KJR1-vBw\n\nThe food came out after a long wait.  Customers were confused because the cashier was calling out the wrong orders and people were returning saying it wasn't what they ordered.  By this time, there were 8 or 9 of us waiting...it was a hot mess in there.\n\nI went for the Carne Asada Burrito first.  I took one bite and didn't like it...it was way too salty.  The Burrito was all Meat & a little Guac/Salsa combo...no Rice or Beans...that's a common recipe in some of these Taco shops.  Since there wasn't any other ingredients to soften the salty flavor, it was just bad.\n\nNext, I went for the Beans/Rice/Cheese (BRC) Burrito.  I took one bite and that one was bland.  I don't know if my taste buds were shot from the salty Carne Asada Burrito, but it wasn't good either.\n\nThe Salsa wasn't *meh* too and couldn't save it for me.  Towards the end of my meal, I noticed a guy speaking in Spanish to the cashier lady...she goes to the back and comes out with a couple of cups of \""""spicier\"""" Salsa that was hidden in the back...dammit!  Secret menu I guess....\n\nThere are too many other good places in town, I won't be back here.\n\nReturn Factor - 0%",0
440,"It's different.  Maybe not my cup of tea, but you have to try this place once.\n\nPrices are great.  Neighborhood shaky but my Ethiopian friend is a regular here and says it's fairly close to homemade!\n\nThe after dinner coffee is authentically prepared and I can only say WOW!",1
441,"I had heard this establishment was coming to the Trader Joe's and Changing Hand's shopping center so I was excited to see it had opened when I went to do my monthly TJ shopping this weekend and decided to give it a try.\n\nFirst, great decor and friendly staff. I sat right at the bar and was glad to see a number of local beers on tap. I ordered a Hopshock IPA and it was served on a wonderfully frosty beer glass, perfect for the summer! In addition, I went for the classic, the Margherita piiza ($9) and added the Proscuitto for $3 more.\n\nI like that you can see them backing the pizza from the dining area and it is a wood fired oven. Interesting that they add the basil fresh chopped on top versus baking it with the cheese and sauce and it did add a nice fresh, herb taste to the overall pizza.\n\nI've never been to the old location and have nothing to compare it to and for me, this establishment is a nice addition  to the overall area. I can certainly see myself going back again for lunch on a weekend and for me, extremely convenient location as it is near so many other great places in this shopping center.",1
442,"What an experience!  This was my first time coming here and I have nothing but good things to say! My bf and I have been wanting to check this place out, since we drove by several times.  So glad we did.  We told the owner we were newbies and he gave us the lowdown.  They got  us set up with the Wii u system and a game. Everything was great and so much fun.\n\nThere were all kinds of people there. A few dance dance revolution masters showing off their skills, call of duty fanatics,  and us - quite the mixed bag! I can't wait to come back,  and that says a lot because I'm not even a gamer. This is a new business,  so come check this place out and spread the word!",1

The drinks were inexpensive and actually had alchohal in the drinks imange that.",1
444,"Pure madness...at 2 pm on a Thursday? Accessible parking was full. There was only one motorized cart. It took me five minutes just to motor into the store, no thanks to the hordes departing who could not see my flag, cart, or colorfully clad body. \n\nBefore coming to the store, I called to get the membership price, and was told there is a $25 option. Um, nope. Try $55...can you say bait and switch?\n\nLong, long lines to check out, just like the day before Thanksgiving or the zombie invasion. \n\nI ran screaming, straight to Sam's Club, where the shoppers are polite and the aisles are well labeled.

445,"First, I want to say from my experience, Chompie's food is very good. Not excellent, but very good.  The service, on the other hand was very poor.  Chompie's is a bit on the expensive side. If there service was good, I might accept that but with poor service, I can't give it higher than 2 stars. \n\nI went to the bakery during lunchtime on Sept. 13th. It was busy so I waited in line like everyone else. As I moved along in line I was asked for my order which included a few bagels, some cookies and a takeout sandwich.  So I'm pulled out of line by one lady who want to ring up my order at this cash register at the stat of the line, not at the end of the line where you usually pay.  I start to take out my wallet and she tells me credit card only, if I want to pay with cash,  I have to get back in line and wait for the OTHER cash register.  O.K. I give her my credit card to pay, but I'm thinking that was annoying. \n\nShe tells me my takeout order will be ready soon. It was a simple bagel sandwich.  So I wait, and wait, and wait. 15 minutes later I ask the lady for the status of this, and it turns out the lady never sent the order to the kitchen so of course its not going to be done.  5 more minutes and its finally done.\n\nThey need to get a bit more organized and provide better service, or I can tell you I will never be back.  There are too many other good places around to deal with one that couldn't care less about my business.",0
446,"This review is for the cheese sandwiches only. I've been dying to try this place, and I'm sure their cheeses are great. However I find them to be a tad bit overpriced, so instead I tried one of their cheese sandwiches.  \n\nCheddar, Gouda, pickles, mustard on sourdough... It can't be bad. But it wasn't great either. The bread was very dry and the insides were sparse and low on flavor.  For a tiny $7 cheese sandwich, I expected more. It wasn't bad; it just wasn't worth $7.",0
447,Went here with my friends after a DRUNK at Tao nightclub. I have to say for Pho made at 330am it was fantastic! The fresh rolls were also quite delicious.

Stick with the beer.",0
449,"I want to start by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE Olive Garden.  It's truly one of my all-time favorites and usually my go-to Italian place when I want something yummy and not want to worry about quality.\n\nThat's why I was SOOOOOO disheartened by this particular location.  The waitress was awesome!!  Best part of the night.  BUT, the food was crap.  Seriously, I almost sent my meal back because it was so freaking bad.  I got the fetuccini alfredo.  The pasta was severely over cooked.  They noodles fell apart as I was trying to wind them around the fork to eat them.  And the sauce was poorly seasoned (like no flavor whatsoever) as well as chunky.  Have you ever had chunky alfredo sauce?  I was thinking, what the heck did they use in this, cottage cheese??  Ewwww!  That's all I have to say about that.  My dining partner said his noodles were also mushy (I thought, maybe, it was just the fetuccini, but nope).\n\nSave your money and eat somewhere else or go to a different Madison location because THIS one was so totally not worth it.",0

451,"Graveyard of Champions (Picture #69 is the menu for Summer '14 -until the end of August?) is the first cocktail I ordered today, wonderfully fresh and fitting for summer. I partially agree with Sandra R. in that the cucumber ice cube is a bit too much, the cocktail was much better when I let my drink sit and some of the cucumber mixed with the drink. Cocktails are meant to be drank slow, sipped and enjoyed. Something my generation does not understand, unfortunately. But the cube was damn large, maybe two or three smaller cubes would be better? Done talking about ice cubes now.\n\nThe second drink was their twist on an old fashioned cocktail. I say twist because I believe he added an olive instead of a cherry and used soda water versus plain. Beautiful. I appreciate a bartender/bar equipped with a muddler despite how simple. \n\nIn all the decor was good. Eye pleasing without taking away from conversation. I went midday, the windows in the front brought in sufficient but not too much daylight. All the metals & classic seating fit together very well. I myself not so impressed with the Buddha chandelier. Whatever.\n\nGreat friendly, knowledgeable bartenders, caring enough to offer waters to people drinking (including myself), bars in this town need to do this more. Great lively atmosphere, no smoking inside (I smoke, don't mind this), some gaming & in addition to the craft cocktails there is also a few craft beers on the menu. They accept credit cards & have clean bathrooms. \n\nI dinged them for the limited/street parking but this definitely won't be my last time here.",1
452,"Went T.V shopping here and had a great experience. Lady that helped us was very helpful. Answered all questions we had to help us make the best decision and did not feel pressured at all by her. Ended up with a 60 in flat screen and are very happy with it. Applied for a line of credit with them. Nice options as well to pay your bill with them, online over the phone(is a fee) or directly in any store which is awesome! I'm all about convenience.  They do also do deliveries for you or you can take home the same day as well. Rule of thumb: if you can make it fit in your car/truck you can take it the same day or else you will have to do delivery.\n\nWill def be back for more home supplies. Sears to me is more of a home place cannot tell you much about the clothes and all that, but for appliances and such i highly recommend.",1

454,"NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY!  This place could have had regular weekly customer, but instead, they blew it. I take my child to a therapist for medical issues next door there. Unfortunately, she is an older toddler who is not potty trained and needs changed frequently.  There is no bathroom at the small therapist office.   I thought I would check out the restaurant and use their restroom.  Upon walking in, I was accosted when I asked to use the restroom.  This is something I am not accustomed to.  Very rude.  They said I had to buy something in order to change my small child  in their restroom.  OK, fine, I buy the expensive lunch.  Then I proceed to wait quite awhile to get it, then I notice it has been sitting for some time and the counter person just never picked it up.  I take it home and eat the lasagna and salad. The salad is very good, the lasagna is average.  Kind of disappointing for the price. The place was so busy, I had higher hopes. I complain to my husband about this and he says it is probably because Sonio's is in a bad part of town with street people around.\n\nNow this week, i desperately need a bathroom again. I plan on buying something,  per their rule.  There is a bad storm outside or else I might try to change her in the parking lot.  As I walk in I am asked about getting a table and say i need to use the restroom first.  This time I am rudely told that the restroom is closed because when they have deliveries, the restroom is closed.  Say what????????????????????  What restaurant is so bent on not letting people use the restroom, especially when they have a kid?   This is so rude and insensitive.  There are no other restaurants except across a busy intersection.  I dont understand why the employees dont show a bit of friendliness or understanding.  Doesnt anyone have kids?\n\nI wont go there again.  They dont seem to care about their customers at all.  My customer service experience was completely negative.",0
455,"I showed up as a walk-in for just one morning in February.  The lady was very nice and helped me with the mat and towel I hadn't brought.  Everyone seemed a bit reserved but still welcoming.   We were packed a bit tight but, from the comments I overheard, that doesn't seem to often be the case.\nI think hot yoga is a crazy concept / form of punishment but, as far as the people and facilities at Sumit's, it was very nice.\n\nThey had a changing room and I think they also had a shower - would be convenient to go straight into work if you were a regular.\nMy phone mapping app didn't quite get me there.

458,I have only been here on New Year's Eve.  The bar and owner are simply amazing!  The energy and friendliness you will find in this bar makes you feel like you are hanging out with your best friends in their super cool basement.

Then I noticed all the ither customers were getting the all you can eat menu.   When I askes the waitress for the all you can eat menu she ignored me.  So I thought she didn't hear me and asked her again.  It was very obvious that she didn't want me to order off that menu.   They were only for certain customers.   So we left and I hear the waitress say she was rude.  Really!!!  If you haven't noticed we are in the 20th century.   Were that traylor trash hillbillies bull isn't excepted anymore.

461,Came in late on a Wednesday night about 30 min before closing. This was not my first choice as I was hoping to try some authentic French montreal food. Unfortunately most closed by 10 pm. \n\nIt was late and I didn't want a big meal. Server suggested ribs or a salad but these were fairly large portions so I went with the appetizer portion of chicken tenders and an iced tea. The ice tea came in a very small glass probably less than 6 oz. it also tasted like what you get from a Lipton or nestea canned drink which is horrible. At $3 it was not a good value. So I didn't have high expectations for my chicken tenders. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!  The tenders were not dry and came with plenty of fries to complement. It was definitely an above average dish. \n\nKudos on the chicken tenders but thumbs down on the ice tea. Thanks for staying open. Server was also friendly and courteous.,1
462,"The Las Vegas version of Serendipity 3 is like a movie sequel, one that disappoints rather than continues your love for the original.\n\nOnce upon a time, John Cusack fell in love with Kate Beckinsdale in movie make-believe at a little whimsical chocolate shop in uptown Manhattan and sent Serendipity 3 into a dizzying spiral of Hollywood fame and public craze.  \n\nWhen I lived in Manhattan 4 years ago, along with hundreds of tourists on a Saturday morning, I waited to experience the fantasy of movie magic and the famed Frozen Hot Chocolate in this fairytale of a chocolate shop/eatery.  It was fun for the experience.  The chocolate was outstanding and the food was all right.\n\nIt is four years later in Vegas, nine years since the movie and long past the 15 minutes given to Serendipity 3.  A location of this charming original opens up right in front of Caesars Palace to cater to undiscriminating tourists in their hung-over states.  The overblown decor becomes cheesy, not whimsical.  The glamorous fair food comes with mediocre quality.\n\nAt best, you can say you've been to Serendipity 3.  I suggest getting the desserts at the take-out stand rather than waiting for a seat at the restaurant.  You'll have a better time seeing the movie again.",0
463,"This buffet is absolutely delicious!!  I advise everyone to go try this buffet out at least a few times.  The thing that I don't agree with is the price.  Although, the buffet was delicious, I don't feel that it was worth he price.  If it was about 7 bucks less, I would have absolutely no complaints about this buffet!",1
464,"Raw, vegan food sounds scary to the uninitiated.  Nothing is cooked, no animal products are used=what the hell am I going to eat? But, do not be afraid, the raw-foodist vegans will not hurt you. You may even really, really like their food.\n\nThe menu at Go Raw resembles most american restaurants.  They have sandwiches, salads, smoothies, \""""burgers,\"""" etc.  The ingredients, however, are a bit different.  For example, the \""""living bread\"""" used for the burgers and pizzas is not really bread, and it's alive (but dehydrated -- it's not crawling around your plate).  Go Raw also does not use animal products whatsoever, so, their \""""sour dream\"""" ain't your grandma's sour cream (meaning no cows involved).\n\nMy go-to favorites are the Purple Burrito, purple cabbage wrapped around veggies, guacamole and and salsa. Soo tasty and healthy.  I also love the Mexicali Sampler which allows you to taste several entrees such as the Enchiladas, Mexi Toast, Flax Crax, and Mexi Wrap.   If you're looking for safe bets, try the pizzas, sandwiches, or \""""burgers.\""""  \n\nI may sound like a total wacko, but, whenever I eat at Go Raw, I feel totally energized for the rest of my day.  I love bloody, bloody meat but I get why the raw foodists swear by this stuff.\n\nMy only criticisms are that the food is crazy salty and the food takes forreeevvverr to get.  I realize the saltiness is probably to make up for the fact that nothing is cooked, but, damn, I drink a lot of water after eating here.  Regardless, Go Raw is great for someone looking for healthy food that is actually delicious as well.  \n\nP.S. - If you're a first timer, try the Westside location, it's, in my opinion, better than the Windmill location.",1
465,"I was told about Ramen Sora by some friends that this ramen was better than Momta's.  I am a BIG fan of Monta so I had to see for myself.   I went to check it out with three coworkers.\n\nI had the spicy miso ramen with green onions and a mini curry bowl.  Two of my co- workers also went with the spicy miso.  One tried the Nori miso.\n\nOverall I would say that the spicy miso was right there with Monta's.  In retrospect, I should have ordered a normal miso to make a better comparison.  Overall I would say that Ramen Sora is right there with Monta.",1
466,"Very disappointing.  I have been there a few times before and it was adequate, but its been about 6 months.  I really want to like this place because we live in Henderson about 10 minutes away and would like not to have to go all the way to Chinatown.\n\nSo we arrived about 12:30, and it was about half full.  The long and short of it is that they only had a couple of carts going around with minimal variety.  Most of the dishes were luke-warm to room temperature (we had to ask to have a couple of them \""""nuked\"""".)  \n\nThe carts never had anything new, and there were no servers circulating with \""""Specials\"""".\n\nWe have been to almost all restaurants serving dim sum in Vegas, with KJ's at the Rio so far the best, and today's experience the worst in 3 years in the Valley.  We lived in San Francisco for 30 years so we were perhaps a bit spoiled.  Our expectations were low going in, but our hopes were very high.  As I started out, \""""very disappointing\"""" and would not recommend.\n\nFor us, never again, at least under present management.",0
467,"This was an enjoyable experience.  Tasted good and was priced decently.\n\nI had a bbq lamb sandwich.  Which is something I had never heard of.  It was essentially a pulled pork sandwich, but with lamb.  The sauce was good.  The bun was soft without being mushy.  The meat was tender.  The fries were really delicious; they had that sort of crumbly coating on them.  With the soda I think it was 7 or 8 bucks.\n\nEveryone else in the party had gyros which they all seemed to like.\n\nRestaurant was clean and the staff was friendly.",1
468,"Ugh. I feel like I just paid $7 (admission fee with coupon) to watch a bunch of infomercials. You walk in and it's just a bunch of booths selling spas and blinds and phones and non-working health devices. I saw nothing \""""cultural\"""" or \""""religious\"""". The food was way overpriced for what it was. If you have no means of getting out of the city, then this might be the place for you; I have experienced festivals waay better than this one. \n\nEven though parking is free and everyone wants a close parking spot (who doesn't?), you're better off parking in the Bass Pro Shop parking lot and walking either through the store or around the Bass Pro Shop and to the front of the Silverton. You'll save yourself a lot of time and hassle and the police directing traffic. If you take that main turn to the Silverton, you're going to be stuck for a while with everyone else going to the Festival. Keep going straight and around the corner and you'll see a place where you can turn left to the Bass Pro Shop parking area.\n\nOh, and don't forget to bring CASH. Don't get stuck pulling out money at the ATMs they set up front.",0
469,"I am giving a generous 2 stars only because I had a good experience last year.   \n\nFirst, I am not a bike novice, but to these douche bags, everyone else is.  I may not have the highest end bikes, but I do own a $3500 a trek carbon road bike and a $4k specialized stumpjumper.  I have been riding bikes for 35 years, so I do know the difference between a juicy and a hayes.  \n\nSo for my experience this year, I rented the same bike I rented a year ago, but my experience was night and day.  Last year, everything was great, from service to the bike itself.  But this year, I called ahead and asked for  availability.  Kyle took my info, but never called me back.  Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I stopped in after getting into phx, and was pleased to get the bike, but unfortunately, they did a 5 minute check over of the bike.  On the trail, the worse of the worse experience.  Front brake dragged and rear was weak, a dangerous combination, at best.\n\nI took it back, and while they did fix it, they seem to assume I must have done damage to the bike.  Anyway, upon returning the bike, they were real knobs about a scratch on the seat post and then the guy told me it was his personal bike.  I told him if you rent out a mountain bike, for mountain biking, you might expect a scratch or two.  \n\nHe didn't like that.   I explained that he shouldn't rent his bike out then.",0
470,Wings are great! Gf and I got the medium and garlic parm to split. Both were amazing. Got ranch for the side and it was really good too. Not too thick and not watered down. Drinks were huge and their ice tea is really good. I got lemon and it even looked good. A big slice and it was juicy. (I'm picky) We also got the bacon jalape\u00f1o popper and they were super good. Been driving by this place for 5 years and never stopped in to eat...stupid. We'll be back!,1
471,No frills store but a great place to find a wide variety of toys and treats for your dog at really discounted prices. I wish they carried a larger selection of premium dog foods (what they have is fairly limited) but if you're looking for toys and dog snacks then this is the place to go.,1
472,"Very nice people who did an amazing job on two of our computers.  One was the transfer of files from an old computer to a newly purchased one.

473,"Extremely disappointed and very angry dog owner today! I took my dog here recently for his 3rd and Final visit. My first 2 visits were great, but the last one lost my faith for good on their unprofessional and uncaring service.\n\nI have a Frenchie with a very sensitive stomach. In the multiple page application they have you fill out I mention that, as well as advised them that the cause of his stomach ailments is rawhide treats. In fact I put on his application that he is ALLERGIC to rawhides and mentioned not to give it to him because he gets bad diarrhea. So when I took him the last time, my dog apparently threw a \""""temper tantrum\"""" which usually means he squeals  really loud when you crate him. I advised the owner of this and she assured me they get that all the time and they can handle it. Well let me tell you how they \""""handled\"""" it. Yup, to quiet him up, they gave him a rawhide treat which he swallowed whole. When the handler that day told me that I was extremely upset. And rightfully so because tonight my poor guy is suffering from awful diarrhea. He is not as active and constantly having to go. \n\nWhat compounded matters more is the gal at the desk was looking over my paperwork to see where I mentioned rawhide and she couldn't find out. I advised her that the paperwork she was reading wasn't mine, and then she laughed it off when she realized her mistake and thought it read wrong because the documents described a cat's history. I was already so angry that they did not read my paperwork, but she was so unskilled to realize the difference between a cat and a dog. I had to point out her error, opposed to her not figuring out that my dog was not abandoned by a cat like the paperwork said. Ugh!!!! When I first visited I was also advised that I shouldn't worry about treats because rawhide is not one of them. Well guess what, it is. \n\nIf you take your dog here, make sure they read your documents. Go over everything with them and mention your dogs issues, otherwise you'll end up like me staying up to take care and clean up after your sick puppy.",0

It was almost humorous. I think he grunted to take our order. It is understandable if his english was bad - but he was speaking english to the other waiter when he was away from our table. It was strange.\n\nOn top of all of that the food was bad. No taste - bland - blah!\n\nThis place will be gone in no time - when your service and food is bad - there is no hope!",0

476,"I was in the area so I went in for a shave after hearing some good things about this place. Supposedly it's a hidden gem in Vegas. I was less than pleased with the shave. No pre-shave oil, lukewarm towel, barber doesn't pull the skin tight which leads to numerous cuts, when he touched up parts of my face he didn't re-lather which means razor burn is going to happen...after all of that I get out of the chair to see half of my neck still had hair on it and my side burns were about an inch off from each other. If you're looking for a cheap place near downtown this may be your place, if you're looking for a great shave look elsewhere. I'll gladly pay $25-50 off the strip somewhere to get an enjoyable shave next time.",0

This happens fairly often. Also, sometimes my TV shows get cut off at the end so I've gotten in the habit of extending the recording 5 mins past just to be sure. There have been times also where my shows just did not properly record. Searching for TV shows is a nuisance (having to type each show title) and going through window after window in order to set multiple show recordings or delete the show from the list. \n\nWhen I lived in San Diego I much preferred AT&T but unfortunately they do not service Las Vegas. The features they had of being able to reset your box via your computer, record options at 2 presses of a button, and just have a system that is more user friendly was just more convenient and less annoying. It was also much much more inexpensive.",0

Or maybe it was when we got to the room and realized that it was looking pretty rough and not the nice-to-luxe accommodations I was expecting for the price. But I really think they moved into never to return territory by the way they handled these issues. Which was not at all. I felt like I fell for the old bait-and-switch. We'll promise you a beautiful resort, but delivery whatever is available and quit your whining.\n\nAt no time did I feel that the staff here cared one whit about our stay. We requested that maintenance come and repair the most glaring issue (the shower faucet that became a projectile and attacked you when the water was turned on), but they never came during our 3-day visit.  No apologies and no offers to move us to a decent room, nada. There were more cosmetic issues, but in some ways I didn't want to look too closely and ponder how the room arrived in its current state of disrepair.\n\nI chose the Mirage for its central location on The Strip and reasonably positive reviews. But after spending time walking through, eating and shopping at about ten other properties, I've realized that The Mirage just isn't for me. They also just instituted a $15/day resort fee, so it really adds insult to injury if you don't like the property. They are going for a Polynesian/Asian theme, but since the property is 20 years old and has been partially renovated, it is not cohesive at all. \n\nI spent the minimum amount of time at the hotel and focused on finding a better property for my next visit.

483,"Allow me to begin with a word of advice to anyone considering a luxury, First Class, vacation experience: When you first arrive at your hotel, if things begin going badly from the start, find an alternate destination- IMMEDIATELY!  I have rarely had things recover from a bad start, and this trip was no different.  Our room was not ready until 4pm, and only then because I said I was leaving (they got me back for pushing- read on)\n\nI am a Repeat Customer to Skylofts.  I have always hated the MGM casino but loved Skylofts enough to put up with walking through the MGM Casino.  Now, unfortunately, MGM has taken over from whoever owned or ran Skylofts before. ( I actually asked at one point- \""""Let me guess, MGM took over this place, right?\"""")(\""""Yes- how did you know?\"""") #DontLoveSkyloftsAnyMore.  It has become the rotting cherry on top of the pile of awful that is the MGM Grand Hotel.\n\nDecor and Suite size, of course, always great.  I recommend staying in one of these suites (preferably in Winter) to experience the showers just once- you can drown standing up! While landing your helicopter as well! I mean it's big.)\n\nButlers and Bell Staff, mostly great.  Butlers not as plentiful or generous as previous visits.\n\""""Concierges\"""" HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!  Some of the female concierges get what I like to call, \""""The Four Seasons Thing\"""" (I can't go to Four Seasons any more, they outlawed smoking there- not that I smoke in Vegas or anything, 'cause that would be wrong), but most of them, particularly one doltish, heavyset fellow who looked like he picked his shirt back up off of the dirty clothes pile that morning (keep the jacket on, buddy), were infuriatingly inept, and did NOT get the \""""Four Seasons\"""" thing.\n\nWEAK AIR CONDITIONING IN AUGUST!!!!!!!!  And for two days, nobody would do anything about it, made lame excuses, and acted like I was being unnecessarily difficult.  (\""""Your room has windows and that makes it hard to keep cool in Summer\"""")  Finally, after two sleepless nights, I let them know we had enough and would be leaving, and I received a visit from a nice man named Mark, who was some sort of Manager.  He moved us to another room, and things improved.  At least we had air.  And they gave us a nice credit toward room charges.  Why couldn't they have taken action sooner?  I can't get those two nights back, but that is not their problem.  The hilarious finish to that issue was that I had to go back to our old room the next morning to retrive my hot spot wi-fi thingy, and there were three workmen there with tarps and tools spread all over, and the air conditioning was blasting copious amounts of cold air all over them.  Note to self, if you need air conditioning, invite the building painters and HVAC guys up for a drink.\n\nOther Highlights:\n\nGetting to share our \""""exclusive\"""" elevator (The \""""exclusive\"""" elevator to Skylofts serves a number of other floors) with drunken golfers and the other the other lovely party guests of the Meegum, was unpleasant, to say the least.  They all stare as you put your key in the slot and push the large \""""Skylofts\"""" button, VERY uncomfortable, nowadays.  \n\n$9 beers.  Beer tastes so much better when you pay 10x the normal price for it, don't you think?

It may be a sign that those willing and able to foot the $2,500 bill have moved to more suitable digs.  In the case of the Skylofts, that is undoubtedly what has taken place. Guess I'll have to give Steve Wynn and Sheldon Adelson a shot- but I dislike the red suites (Wynn) and the smell of the Ventian (too perfume-y!)  Ahhh- Bellagio- You Win!

And while I was initially very iffy about the quality of meat, I was very, very surprised.  I focused on the bulgogi, pork loin, and some other kind of pork that looked like thick cut bacon.  They were all delicious.  I wish they had onion or peppers to grill too, but not having it was no big deal to me.  The rice, niku-man, egg rolls, and sweet and sour chicken were great too.  Instead of going to one of my three favorite ramen places next time I go home to Vegas, I'll be coming here.  I don't think I'll ever pay the dinner price, at least not while I'm in school, but I think the weekday lunch price is very reasonable.",1

Even the bread basket is awesome - chili asiago cheese, walnut raisin, blue cornbread... Yummy. We had some chocolate pudding that was delicious, creamy milk chocolatey.

491,"So once every few years I think to myself \""""hey maybe I should go to a cheap Chinese buffet\"""" and then more often than not I regret my decision. This time was no different. Despite the reviews on Yelp this place got Best of Las Vegas (at least if my memory serves me right) so we decided to try it. It was at a premium price, for this place, around $16 for the weekend seafood buffet. We went on Saturday night, no wait but extremely busy. Service was poor, I had to track someone down when I wanted a drink refill and in the middle of dinner they took my soy sauce away. I thought to fill it or exchange and bring it back, but no it was just gone.  They had less selection of Chinese food than I expected, maybe because there was more seafood. A lot of people were eating the snow crab, but that is just way too much work for me for so little reward, I am a king crab or nothing kind of girl unless it is already cracked open. They also had salt and pepper frog legs, which was different, although I didn't try it. The only thing that I liked was some sort of seafood medly on a shell with a baked on mayonnaise sauce. I recently saw a poster that bacon was the duct tape of food, and if that is so I think mayonnaise is like the glue - it helps quite a bit to repair food that would otherwise lack in flavor. They had a small sushi bar, and it was well meh - I guess I should be thankful there was any sushi, and there were a few different kinds - tako, salmon, tuna, eel, a number of norimaki rolls. The rolls were okay. Also, I tried the white fish but I wasn't sure what type of white fish it was, maybe Tilapia, but it really wasn't that good. They had salt and pepper squid, which again was okay.  So yes - overall I would say, some items were okay at best but I won't ever be coming back.",0
492,"I met a couple of friends here Sunday morning (by that I mean noon - don't judge me) for breakfast. I have been searching high and low for a place to finally catch on to the bacon bloody mary craze, and I heard this was the right spot. I expected a crowd, but there was plenty of parking and plenty of seating available. I became skeptical, and rightfully so. I was not at all impressed by the boring 1985 country-kitchen d\u00e9cor, which included grandma-powder-blue diner booths and a few rogue tables in unfortunate positions. The walls were \""""decorated\"""" with nothing more than dozens of identical empty ketchup cans and a couple of oddly placed flat screens. The food was disappointing, at best. I'm not sure how they managed to ruin simple potatoes, but I'm fairly sure it was intentional. They were hard round disks that appeared to have been soaked in some kind of onion-oily substance, and tasted nothing short of old. The bacon-bloody was equally as disappointing. It was mediocre in flavor and had relatively no kick = pointless. The only thing bacon-y about it was a skewered piece of chewy bacon climbing out the top - good for display, but perhaps they should consider cooking it first or maybe working the flavor into the drink. In fact, I didn't really see anything bacon-y about this place. It's a shame because there really is a lot of potential here -great location, open and spacious layout, a full bar (which is v. important in any breakfast joint), etc. \n\nI'm giving the stars for the decent, friendly service and the availability to get a table at any time. I typically judge my breakfast experiences by how helpful they are in relieving my hangovers. I was hoping for a fun, lively environment coupled with a little hair-o'-the-dog, in which my friends tell me about the good times I had the night before (because i can't remember). Sadly, Bacon didn't come through for me.",0
493,Beware of the kids computer area. I am at this library twice a week and the kids there are always cussing and acting inappropriate. The first time I heard them I told a lady in the homework room and she told me to go to youth desk and report it. She did nothing. Told them i saw an 11 year old watching straight up porn from youtube. The manager didn't even go through the history and said it was an accident and he couldn't remember what he clicked on. She told him that they needed to know so they could block it. That's it! This kid intended to watch it and maximized it for a whole 3 minutes. My 7 year old daughter just got an eye full and I am not happy with management's reaction.,0
494,"Firefly is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas and I love their food and sangria SOO MUCH. I haven't really tried anything from their menu that I dislike and I love it! Favorite dishes: stuffed dates, tuna tartare, baked tetilla, manchego mac 'n' cheese, lobster escargot, camerones a la diabla, croquetas, the filet sliders... basically everything.  But I have to give this location one star off because it's near the strip so it's SUPER CROWDED and as a result the service can be a little slow. Also there are a number of sketchy characters in the parking lot (one guy came up to my car to ask me for money, another one yelled at my husband and called him a heathen??!).\n\nBUT they are open later than the other locations which is good for me and my late night tendencies! And it's Firefly so still super yummy.",1
495,"Food is alright, but you better set aside half of your day if you want to eat here. After waiting for 45 minutes for a table, food took another hour and then it took 30 minutes after finishing our breakfast to get our check. We had to flag down the hostess for drink refills and to take out credit card at the end.\n\nThe pros were that they do offer gluten free pancakes and waffles. I tried a Waffle which was just okay.. But it was nice to have GF option either way. Also, the fresh squeezed Oj was really good. The hostess and waiter were very friendly.. But I don't see myself coming back.. The wait was just ridiculous.",0
496,"Had an incredible lunch here. Had the American and the Brittania Burgers.   Brittania Burger was by far the winner.  Incredible taste and combo of sweet/savory.  The Maui onion rings were on par too.  Loved the chipotle mayo and cheddar ranch.  Our server was absolutely top notch.  Though it took our food a little while to get to table, she checked in, made small talk, and helped the time pass so nicely, we barely noticed.  Highly recommend this.",1
497,I love the food and the great service BUT I made reservations for my work event (7 people) and the location on Tropicana was closed.  I wish they would have told me this when I called the Tropicana number and made the reservations???\nWe had to wait for a taxi to take us to the 2nd location.  Not a good way to impress the owner of your company,0

499,"I actually found this guy on Yelp.  I purchased some sandals last fall on sale, and unfortunately, I needed some extra holes punched in to them because they were hurting my feet.  I had tried to exchange them at the store, but because it had been so long, I was unable to do so.  I was encouraged by the store to find a local shoe store to just get holes punched into the straps to accomidate my situatation.\n\nSo, I find this guy on Yelp.  I called in advance to see if he would be able to help me.  He said he could, and that he was open until 3.  So, I race over there, and he punched the holes in my sandals while I waited!  wooohoo! I was so grateful!\n\nHe charged me 50 cents a whole, times 4 holes for a whole $2!  This is great! \n\nThe store itself is small, but organized and rather clean.  They sell all kinds of shoe stuff, and do all kinds of repairs not only just to shoes, but luggage, zippers, etc.  He says he's been in business for 16 years now, and to keep coming back.  Good experience for something so simple and mondane.",1
500,"This really was a treat that I didn't see coming. We were trying to go to Mesa Grill, but it was pucking facked. So you can tell, I was feeling something big and beefy which probably colored my menu selections a bit. Enough about me, more about Spago. Note they have 2 different menus depending on where you sit (cafe and dining room). We sat in the dining room. \n\nGroup of 3 of us arrived at about 7:30 on a Thursday, no wait at all (kind of atypical in Vegas!). We sat down, were served super promptly, and got  an amuse bouche of potato leek soup brought out right away. Awesome. They have a couple gin oddities on their bar, so I got a gin martini. Almost lost some points since the waiter asked if I wanted a lime in it (that would be a gimlet, not a martini). But whatevs. The martini was done very well...it had a remarkable floral scent to it quite a treat...try the cape rock organic gin. It was also $14, but that seems more the norm than the exception in Vegas.  \n\nI had the most elegantly presented heirloom tomato soup in the entire world.  The waiter brought a covered bowl to my table, lifted the top off, and there was a beautiful dense red soup with a pine branch drawn into the top of the soup using a olive oil/basil sauce. Stunning. And the soup was great too...the crouton served with it matched perfectly. Very very well done here.\n\nSince I was in a meaty/grilly mood (expecting to head to a Flay joint), I got the kobe flat iron steak. It was also exceptional. The steak was perfectly well done, nice and chewy (its a flatiron people, it should be chewy), but not tough at all. It was served with some broccolini which fit this dish perfectly. I'm only sorry I was too full for dessert.  \n\nThey brought out an assortment of bread in a basket before the appetizers, and I was having a tough time choosing between them since they all sounded great. After I made a tough choice for the bread I had selected, the waiter asked if I wanted something else. It was perfect - I was able to sample all of the breads that sounded great to me. He also came back 2-3 times during the meal to see if we wanted any more. Also, our water glasses never got below 1/3 full. Its weird, I've always wondered why the mid-high end restuarants typically don't have this kind of service, when you are clearly going to pay a fair chunck of change for dinner. Its awesome to see a place that really aims to please you in every way possible. Also, the wait staff was generally transparent during the meal even though they were doing a lot of work clearing our table, customizing cutlery, filling water, etc.\n\nThe dining area is perfectly decorated. Its a little trendy, but not blinking red light and technoey. The decor is so right because you can walk in there wearing anything (ahem...within reason) and not feel out of place. Its great for any age group - 20ish to 60ish. Its a little loud, but not disruptivley so. You are going to have to pay a bit for this place (app, dinner, and a single martini ran me $100 after tip), but I'd do it again on my own dime in a heartbeat.\n\nIts one of those rare 5 star places. Well done sir Puck.",1
501,"ANOTHER BIG TIME FAIL FROM MY YELP COMMUNITY!!\n\nCraving some serious breakfast after a long night of partying. I had already bookmarked this restaurant prior to my Las Vegas Trip based on the stellar reviews. We ventured away from the strip to this restaurant located in an industrial area inside a small strip mall don't flinch you might miss it. \n\nMy wife and I arrived at 1pm., placed our name on the wait list, Very friendly gentlemen greets us and tells us there is a 25min. wait. I says no problem. We were seated within the time frame, our waitress takes our order right away as we were starving. I usually stop at Starbucks to get a coffee when eating at most breakfast spots as the coffee tends to be weak but I overlooked my instincts lazily and decided to try theirs. Well unsurprisingly the Coffee was super weak. As soon as I added creamer it turned milky instantly. My Bad $2.50.\n\nFood/Prices- I opted for the DENVER OMELETTE with home fries and Toast Price was decent under $9. I asked the waitress if I can sub bacon for the ham that comes with the denver she said no problem.  Our order took a little while to come out. The presentation looked great big portion for sure; better than it tasted. My OMELETTE- TOTAL grease pit, they used tons of oil to cook it, plus the cheese stuffed inside was your poor quality cheese used at most LA style burger joints that increased the greasiness further. First couple bites were very mushy eggs were not cooked that well, upon further inspection I also noticed very little bacon in my omelette so I began to open it up and noticed they didnt even cook the bacon at all prior to stuffing it in my omelette. The potatoes were the only thing that came out good they were hot and crispy. I couldnt finish it even though I was starving i did enjoy the potatoes but was very dissapointed. \n\nMy wife ordered the French toast special, served with Eggs and Bacons under $9. Her eggs also cooked with tons of oil, bacon was good. The French toast that everyone raves about was weak yo. First of all it was served cold, next it had no flavor you couldnt add enough syrup to give it flavor. No moistness, no tastes of eggs or cinnamon ever touching the bread. Maybe they dipped the texas toast in milk and pan fried not sure. Was a total fail. \n\nWaitress came by asked us how our food was, I told her I was disappointed with the french toast coming out so cold. She opted to warm it up for us but by this time I was completely disillusioned with my meal. I decided to pay, leave and will not come back. \n\nPrices are Good; Portions are Big, Service Is Good, However, I prefer quality over quantity food was not on point. Sorry Yelpers this was a fail dont do it! Should have tried the breakfast spot at my hotel not worth the hassle of leaving the Strip.",0
502,"I was Looking for some tires obviously-22's that is. Planned on getting some tires on the weekend. Ended up getting stuck in Phoenix on a Friday night after 5pm.

They don't load the plate with a pound of cheese and a half a pound of garnish like some places (carlos O) does.\nNor do they just do 1 thing great and forget the rest- it's all great. And then you have other places that grill meat or do something fancy with fish/chicken or meat and slop half cooked rice and garbage beans on your plate. This is good home grown mexican food! Great family that has made an awesome business themselves. Many many others must agree or they wouldn't be so packed most of the time, great neighborhood place too, that's why you see them do so many take out orders.",1

506,"Got a groupon for $30 for 4. I asked the receptionist/front desk how much is the regular price and she said $10+/person. First, the place is not busy, not even 10 people inside that big place. Second I notice was the dust infront of the receptionist table/counter, she's not busy! Why can't she wipe her counter! I could write my name on it!... Yikes! The one star I'm giving is for the place, it's very classy, minus the dust. Restrooms are clean and can compare it to a hotel on the strip. The servers are very nice and attentive. Gave them a good tip! Food... Half star! Selection was not very good, I guess because they are only open for like a few a hours they only cook one time and that's it! Food is very dry, over cooked and very few selection. The only dessert are jello (my daughter made a comment that it's like a square gummy!) have a few fruits, a pudding, no cakes or cookies. They have that soft serve ice cream. I'm pretty sure this buffet will close in just a few weeks. We left like 1pm and they couldn't even fill up half the place. They are not open for dinner. That's why they charge so much it's not for the food but to pay for their rent. My suggestion go to Krazy Buffet (By Sahara and Cimarron) or Buffet@Asia (they have a couple of branches but the best one was at Spring Mountain and Sahara. You won't even have to pay $10 for lunch and the food is way better than over here (10x way better!) Save your money and just eat at Panda Express, you'll be very pleased! Never coming back here. It's a waste of money, gas and time.",0

Options get expensive though.  Enjoy!",1
508,"Ok, so you read the other reviews and maybe you think I am just being a lemming.  No, I think this very non-descript place has it going in the taste and authenticity departments.  Today at lunch was my 2nd visit as I was torn between my satisfaction at Ping Pong Thai down further on Sunset and this place.   \nSo today I had their chicken satay app, papaya salad Lao/Thai style and then the awesome green tea steamed buns!  Yes, they had them today!   \nThe satay app is rather hearty.  5 skewers of marinated grilled chicken served with the traditional peanut sauce and a small refreshing cucumber salad.\nIt was very good and I used the peanut sauce sparingly;  just enough for added flavor. \n\nTheir payaya salad blew away Ping Pong's version.   They grate the payaya just slightly larger so it has great texture and crunch.   Instead of tomato slivers they use halved baby roma tomatoes which explode with tomato-y flavor.  They cut the long beans just large enough so you know they are beans.  The dressing is very light, non-oily and you can order your heat accordingly.   Loved it!\n\nI ended with the steamed green buns.  They are little pillows of deliciousness!   HINT: Order the steamed buns when you order your food because they come to your table freshly steamed so the interior green tea filling needs time to cool a bit otherwise you might get molten filling tongue burn...Ouch!    The buns are about 2.5 inches in diameter and are soft and fluffy.   The filling is just slightly sweet and redolent of green tea aroma and taste.   These tasty treats are so deceptively good that you could easily eat 6 and never know it, so I limited myself to 2.  \n\nI say if you want to try some authentic Thai food in an unpretentious clean little place do come here.",1

510,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Cabana at the Pointe. In the Phoenix area, it is one of the safer, more affordable complexes on the market. Specifically, it hit on the key items I was looking for in an apartment complex:\n\nAffordability - Great prices for what you receive, especially considering the location. Right near the 51, and a short drive from anywhere in Scottsdale, or Downtown Phoenix.\n\nCleanliness - The grounds were always kept clean, the pool was sparkling and there was never any trash around whatsoever.\n\nMaintenance - They have a new online maintenance system that allows you to report any broken items in your apartment, and they will come fix them asap. The day after I submitted a request, it was tagged, fixed and a note was left in my apartment. Very convenient!\n\nSafety - Nighttime security and a very quiet, safe complex.\n\nOffice Staff - Helpful, friendly and informative. Shout out to Jillian for always having a smile on her face and a ready-to-help attitude.\n\nAmenities - Covered parking spaces, multiple laundry locations, multiple mailbox locations, clean pool and small workout facility. All great as advertised.\n\nIf you are reading through apartment reviews, take this one seriously and head over to Cabana at the Pointe for a visit. Everything checks out as advertised, and they're dedicated to making your stay a good one!",1
511,"Let's go to the movies! When all other theaters in town are sold out, come here and you'll have elbow room to spare. \n\nIt has been a while since my last visit...like most people with a new car, park far away from everyone to save the new and shiny as long as possible...just to find a ding in the side when I returned from the show. Anyway, took my chances and came back to see a newly released matinee. I tried Phillips Place and Epicentre before coming here and both shows and future showings were sold out. However, AMC wasn't and had plenty of seating to spare. Like others have noted, if you don't want a crowded theater with 22 screens you are bound to find a show and still keep your personal space.\n\nThe concession stand was great and speedy. The popcorn was delicious...although now you serve up your own butter. Obviously, I need to get to the movies more often. \n\nMy one issue is if you buy your tickets online and pay the extra fee, you shouldn't have to wait in the ticket line to get a physical ticket (really defeats the convenience). Hopefully theaters and Fandango can work that out. \n\nOverall, I'm very happy with AMC on South Boulevard.",1
512,"I go here for the cheap happy hour beers and the company. I usually sit at the bar. The seating has gotten better but when they put the backs on the chairs people would lean back and almost break them. The cushions fabric on the chairs make you sweat badly and the concrete bar table will burn your arms in the summer and they are in the shade. The food is good and cheap. The bar waitress are good but sometimes you get that \""""one\"""" who won't pay attention to you at all. I think she is more concerned about popping out those fake boobs at everyone. The parking isn't that great.",0
513,"I wish I could rate different aspects separately.  Hotel is old, but is in the process of an upgrade.  Our group of teachers got a discount that made it very affordable.  The rooms were small, but nice with flat screen TVs and very nicely refitted bathrooms.  The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in.  Some of the rooms were not completely refitted--my room was missing the mini-fridge and another person in our group didn't have a shower door installed.\nWhat's great about this hotel is the location.  Right on the point and what a view. You can walk to just about everything.  The staff was friendly and helpful too.  Another plus, a shuttle service that is free and takes you any place you want to go within a three mile radius.  I'd definitely go back again.",1

The smoky flavor from the grill makes the chicken extra flavorful.  It also had delicious Mexican rice & just enough melted cheese.\n\nTheir salsa was so good I finished every chip!  This place would be compared to a locally owned Baja Fresh, but so much better ingredients and true Mexican flare, right down to the mariachi music being piped in!

515,"To whom it may concern. Today my family and I visited your lake pleasant and Happy Valley Location. I'm sad to have to be reporting that our dining experience was far below satisfactory. Let me begin by telling you the manner in which your \""""Lead Brooke B\"""" presented herself in front of paying customers has left us with a sour feeling  in our stomachs and heavy hearts for the other 2 employees Sam and Jenn for having to report to such a person.\n\nOur experience began after ordering we observed  Brooke tell Jenn (while Jenn was cutting paper we're assuming for trays) that she should pretend she was getting payed while at work and go actually work. You could see on Jenn's face she was mortified and holding back the tears. I went and grabbed the manager on duty and I apologize I didn't get his name. I told him what I heard and he said Brooke's just having a bad day and apologized on her behalf.. Okay being the understanding person that I am I get being in a serving  industry you have good an bad days, just like any one we human. But to my dismay Brooke's lack of professionalism didn't end there.\n\nBrooke had asked Sam to hurry it up with the shakes that making shakes wasn't rocket science. Moments later Brooke asked Jenn to go outside to clean the tables. Jenn cleaned 2 but one family was still eating. I witnessed her taking the food they were done with and went back to the register as the line was getting pretty backed up...\n\nWhen Brooke noticed the out side dining area was still dirty, Brooke grabbed the manager and said I can't believe her (Jenn) if I could I swear I'd smack the shit out of her..\n\nThen walked to Jenn and pulled her mid sentence helping a customer and let's go outside and chat about what I mean when I ask for something to be done. At the very second I couldn't take it I stopped her and said. You are ruining our dining expirence. How dare you talk to your colleges like this.. Brooke started laughing and asked if I was serious.. I replied this is no laughing matter and you should stop smiling immediately. As a business owner my self I am appalled that she thinks this is funny. I told her my family  are paying customers and have the right to enjoy our meal but instead I have been taking notes on her behavior. She said she was sorry but that's how she is she was just kidding with them and everyone likes it or leaves it. I told her she should be apologizing to Sam and Jenn for acting that way and the rest of the diner for literally ruining all our meals. at this time an older couple behind us started clapping an thanked us for standing up for in there words those 2 poor girls.. I told Brooke that once we left I  will be contacting the franchise owner. She grabbed her badge and said here is my name and its a corporation not a franchise. My family and I left utterly disgusted.\n\nThe attitude and complete lack of respect for her colleges makes me sick to my stomach. We will never be returning to any other smash burger and negativity travels fast. One oh shit moment erases a life time of compliments. I will be sharing my story with anyone who will listen including social media, yelp and the BBB.\n\nFor the sake of those 2 wonderful employees sake I hope this message is heard and that Brooke is reprimanded accordingly.\n\nPlease feel free to reach me by email at Mrsbrittanytafoya@gmail\n\n\nThank you for you time,\n\nBrittany Tafoya\nCEO and Owner of ATR Preschool",0

All we ordered was two salads and some lentils. We had to leave even before it was served because we had prior plans, and were nearly late. The reason our meal was late was that the kitchen forgot our order and the waitress didn't check on why it took 45 minutes to make two salads.

521,"We stayed at the Luxor for 5 days, 4 nights in December. While reading other reviews I was a tad worried that our rooms would be awful.  Other then that I had no major worries. Check-in process was insane. There were so many people trying to check-in and out that you could not tell which line went where. Also there were many Luxor employees \""""hanging\"""" around the registration area that did nothing to let guest know where to go. Once we found the line it was not that bad of a wait because they opened up more check-in stations.\n\nWe were in the Pyramid and were told how to get to our room which was pretty easy. My only complaint was that it was on the other side of the casino but that is nothing major. I was pleasantly surprised when I entered our room to see modern and updated furniture as well as a brand new TV. My only concern with where the room was that we would hear a lot of noise from the casino below but we heard nothing our entire stay.\n\nAs for the casino it is just like all the others I have ever been too. My biggest complaint of all the casino is Vegas are that they allow smoking which is disgusting and make it unbearable to gamble in the evenings. During the day and early afternoon I was fine but once the early evening and late night hit I could not stand to be anywhere near a casino.\n\nFood was rather lacking in my opinion but they do offer an array of fast food and casual dining plus two Starbucks. It was not that big of a deal to us because we went to Mandalay Bay and New York, New York for dinner the entire trip and that was connected by walkways. I just wish they had a few more options for breakfast other then Mcdonalds, Starbucks, and the Pyramid Cafe.\n\nThere were about three shops in the Luxor so just go next door to Mandalay or down to City Center or Planet Hollywood to get your shopping fix. As for entertainment the Luxor has Criss Angel's Believe, Carrot Top, Fantasy, and Menopause the Musical. We saw Criss Angel and I was not impressed. Compared to the other hotels on the strip Luxor needs to think about getting some more or different shows. We did not try any of the bars or lounges at Luxor as we went elsewhere since most were closed on Monday and Tuesdays.\n\nCheck-out was a breeze since we put the daily resort fee on a credit card. We just used the express check-out located by the bank of elevators or the main desk to return our keys which avoided the long check-out line.\n\nOverall this was a great hotel and even better deal for six people. I would not hesitate to stay again.",1
522,"We were just in Las Vegas and, after dining in some very good restaurants in two hotels, we decided to go off the Strip.  I had read several reviews and thought this would be a very good find.  We were somewhat disappointed. There were six of us and we decided to order cocktails, rather than wine.  It appeared that the server was a bit disappointed!!  The menu was OK and the food was a little bit better than that.  Definitely, didn't compare to the other meals we had during our stay.  The service was below par...had to constantly flag someone down to fill our water glasses. There are many, many other fine restaurants to dine at...we will not be returning to this one.",0
523,"Wow, what a great foodie find!  Though it is located off the strip, this place is well worth it, especially if you are dining on a budget.  Prices are really decent and food here is very good.  I ordered their yellow curry with chicken. I was very pleased as they used white meat chicken as opposed to dark meat, which I dislike.  Portion was very generous and the overall taste was good.  A great deal especially since it was only $6.75 for my meal.   Some of the other members of my party ordered their duck soup and said it was delicious. Pad thai and pad see ewe are pretty tasty too.  \n\nMy hubby and I use to dine at Archie's off Flamingo as they have pretty good food too, but in comparison to this place, their prices are higher and portions not as generous.  \n\nTIP:  Skip the overpriced Thai/Asian Restaurants located inside the hotels on the strip.  Food is just ehh and not to mention, they hurt the pocket.  This place has pad thai for $6.75 while the Lemongrass located in the Aria Hotel has it for $16-20 a plate. (I am not exaggerating either!) Taste wise and price wise, Thai Style Noodle House is wayyy better.",1
524,"Came here on a 4 day 3 night package deal that was incredibly affordable with the mandatory Timeshare Presentation\n\nSix of us got a banging two-bedroom suite equipped with Jacuzzi, washer/dryer, projector, full-sized kitchen, king-sized beds, and a decent view - We were on the 14th floor facing an empty parking lot but still, we weren't in the hotel room for most of the trip.\n\nPros: \n-BEST deal ever.  Our room was inexpensive, spacious, and overall very comfortable\n-Large pool downstairs\n-Awesome Housekeeping - Asked for a bunch of stuff and they readily obliged (extra towels, blankets, etc.). \n-Short timeshare presentation (we didn't exactly have the finances for it so our sales lady, Wendi, let us leave to enjoy ourselves earlier, yay~)\n-Early Check-in and Extended check-out by an hour\n\nTips:\n-If you want a little extra, remember to GIVE a little extra! You're on vacation; I'm sure you can afford to give away some change money\n-Earlier Check-in available on a first-come first-serve basis\n-Free luggage storage available for early arrivals or late flights - a real added convenience!\n\nThank you for a pleasant and wonderful stay!",1
525,"The best meal we have ever had in Vegas.  Our waiter was so friendly, well versed on each dish, wine, events.  The food runners knew every dish, described them beautifully to refresh our memory and were just really nice.  We loved the layout of the restaurant so you get the Michelin rated food with a friendlier atmosphere and the most attentive service.\n\nWe did the $155 tasting menu and it was amazing.  Foie gras parfait was unique.  I have a new appreciation for heirloom tomatoes and the salad was a work of art.  The king crab was beautiful.  Langostine was perfectly cooked and left me wanting more.  The onion tart was outrageously good.  The salmon was my least favorite as it was a bit salty.  The quail stuffed with foie gras was beyond amazing and the cap steak was excellent.  Having two desserts seem quite decadent but we are on vacation and they were both perfection.  The  generous wine pairings were a perfect accompaniment to the tasting.\n\nI highly recommend L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon!",1
526,"Im giving this 1 stars because it is a very long time from the time I drop of my dog to picking up. 5 hours. also I took him before and they did an okay job not the best but i figured for the price I would give it another try. this time i took him i did not like the hair cut on my dog i asked for a lion cut, and they cut him completely down on the head and left all his hair on his right leg all the way up and his left leg was shaved down. Also his paws were completely messed up. I have included pictures. And also I got a full groom, which meant a bath included. Well my dogs ears were still dirty and it looked like they forgot to bathe him, and he smelled like he did before. And usually he smells good after a groom. Im like so mad about this. The price is good, but I don't think they will be going back after this last experience.",0
527,"I am pretty sure my friends and I stumbled into a coke party when we came here for a late bite after a house show back in the Neighborhood.\n\nThe lights were low, there were people dry humping each other wall-to-wall, and lots of frequent, quick trips in and out of the bathrooms by staff and guests alike.\n\nAll to a soundtrack of terrible techno.\n\nAll of this would've been worth a laugh if it weren't for the food.  We ordered a vegan pizza, a couple cheese slices, and an order of garlic knots.\n\nThe vegan pizza was a barely-cooked pie with hummus haphazardly smeared across it.  The worst part about it was the paprika - they had attempted to season the hummus, but for some reason, rather than sprinkling the spices across the entire pie, there were 5 distinct, huge mounds of paprika that spotted the pie like an outbreak of chickenpox.\n\nThe slices came out first, and were cold even before we reminded them that we ordered garlic knots - which took an unholy 20 mintues, after we reminded them.\n\nTo top it all off - the garlic knots, those of the epic cooking time, were completely cold and raw in the middle.\n\nEddie's pizza is like some bizarre circle of hell.",0

530,"OK, I am not seeing what others see here. For starters, it was like smoking a pack of cigarettes it was so smokey in there. Service and drinks were average but that place needs a good cleaning. Dust everywhere, bar is falling apart and looking a bit worn out. It is apparent MAMA is taking all the money and not reinvesting it in her home. This place was embarrassing as far as a piano bar goes to our out of town guest. Not up to par for Vegas standards. Very, Very dirty and sound system is lacking any real production value. This place reminds me of an old drag queen bar from the 70's. \nMy bet is it wont be around for long at its current decay.",0
531,"Geee-ross!  The other half and I got take-out for this place.   But first a little back-story....  My dad's whole family worked at a Chinese restaurant in Philly from before I was born until the late 1990's.  My mother says she craved Chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on Chinese in the womb. I bless her for having done so. I love Chinese and could eat it every day...willingly.  I've tried Chinese in every city and country I've ever lived or visited, as I always love to see what's out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations. I can usually find something good, no matter how nasty or base a buffet, or made-to-order.  And Lord knows I love take-out and a movie on the sofa.  Great nite, rite?\n\nA few weeks ago I convinced the better half to go pick up Gourmet House of Hong Kong, if I paid and he drove. Deal. Done.  I ordered on the phone - no problems. It's rite down the street from our house, so dinner was steaming hot and in the living room within 20 minutes.  We queued up the DVD and we're ready to go.\n\nThe fried rice was yummy and OK.  Not the best I've had but not the worst either.  The BBQ pork app was good and I liked the dipping sauce it came with. Everything else was skank.  I'd say avoid the noodles at all costs. They were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery, flavorless sauce.  Even with soy sauce added, they did nothing for me.  \n\nI'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on Yelp seemed pretty good.  The place is not that great looking from the outside, and never having been inside, I can't comment on that -- but I would never get take-out from here again.  At least we didn't get sick.  It was just bland-o-rama, which makes me sad.  I even threw-out the leftovers, which has only ever happened  one other time with Chinese take-out, when I left for vacation the next day and didn't want to stink up the fridge.",1

533,I've stayed here over ten to fifteen times over the past 5 years.  Sometimes for up to three weeks at a time.  But I am fed up with the nickel and diming.  \nThe last straw was the throttling of the internet down and an extra fee for higher speeds.  Is it not enough that we get charged for it in the resort fee?  \nI could barely check emails and god forbid I tried to surf two pages at the same time.  For a good connection I'd have to shell out another $8.99 per day in addition to the $25.99 resort fee.\nNo thanks.,0

So sue me.  \n\nWhen I have gone to Joe's, it is VERY late night as the various clubs near Shoeman/Scottsdale begin to wind down, and this place has a huge line out the door every time.  The pizza, which is sold by the HUGE slice, is simply acceptable - not special, not delectable, not even excellent.....just acceptable.  For me, pizza starts with a great cheese, and the cheese here just seems so....bashas-like and ordinary, without that quality mouthfeel you get from cheese at places like Street of New York.    \n\nOf course, when you're binging after six drinks, \""""acceptable\"""" has a funny way of becoming \""""I must have it right now.\""""  So I'm sure I'll go there in the future, but my expectations will be well calibrated -- This is drinking food, placed smack dab in a location that caters directly to people that have been drinking.\n\nBuzzed or not, that long line can sure be annoying.....",0

We decided 20 minutes in that we should get a cocktail,  but no one cam back to our table.  I had to get up and go to the bartender on duty to ask him to send someone over to refill our iced tea, soda and water.  He did.  Then we got our food.  Not how we ordered it, but it was delivered by an expeditor, so he had no idea.  No one came back to check.  It was not busy, so there was no excuse for this.  We couldn't even get our bill!!  I had to request our check from another stranger!  This place was ridicilous.

I heard good things about it so yeah why not.\n \nWe entered and first thing I noticed was the Halloween theme. It looked like someone did a half hearted job on decorating for Halloween and couldn't actually be bothered to take it down.Skulls, spider webs and an Ouija board. The jukebox is full of alternative Hard Rock & Metal, How did I know this? - How could I not?! It was loud, damn loud. Which is off-putting and normally I would have left already, but I was already on my extra cold Guinness and we were to wait for people to meet here. Thus I was to endure the loud grunting noises of Attila, Lordi and the antics of the village idiot that kept bumping into people. After several pints I decided that I needed to go for a trip to the bog. \n\nM a j o r  m i s t a k e.\n\nI have been to many a gentleman's toilets in many shady establishments, spend a penny in the Hogmanay 2006 portaloo and also spend my time in student houses.

The main toilet was clogged up. I shall not go into details (I can't as I am still dealing with PTSD) \n\nThe staff was nice, but seemingly not interested in people well being or health, as many patrons went in and out of that toilet. * shudder *\n\nLuckily we left after an hour to go to our restaurant.",0

539,"I went for breakfast. It was the best buffet of my trip. I think the Rio buffet might beat it (from another trip years ago), but it handily surpassed the Parisian Village, the Mirage Wicked Spoon, and Mandalay Bay's buffet from this particular Vegas jaunt.\n\nThe Wynn's decor was lovely, but the food was the star. My breakfast had a lot of variety and included more expensive items like seafood and lox. There was both fresh and dried fruit. I think there was a seafood omelet in addition to the omelet station. I had lox-topped pizza. There was probably other stuff but I was too busy with the fish. \n\nThe real awesomeness was in the dessert. Yes, I ate dessert. For breakfast.\n \nAnd I even ate it first.\n\nBless their hearts, the Wynn staff had out a full dessert spread at 9 AM. Tres leche in a shot glass, lemon meringue pie, little cakes (regular and sugar-free), pastries, eclairs.  \n\nI really love dessert. And a good dessert puts me in my happy place. This is when I close my eyes and let the flavor fill my mouth and pretty much make sweet love to my spoon, one slow bite at a time. It is sweet, creamy nirvana.\n\nI did that in the Wynn. There was a French couple seated next to me, and the male half of the couple kept looking over at me, wondering what I could possibly be eating that was so good. \n\nNo other dessert in all of Vegas put me in my happy place.

540,"So here we are, Tuesday night dinner and I'm not really hungry.  I mean I've normally got a healthy appetite (healthy appetite -you know, something more than just a salad or a nibble of something)  but tonight I'm not so hungry so I ask if I can split a quesadilla with hubby.   Steak please.  He comes home with that thing and at first I'm thinking this isn't right cuz the container is too light.  Yes I know a tortilla, cheese, and beef really shouldn't weigh a lot.  Don't ask me what I was thinking.  Besides, by then it was probably my stomach talking.\nOpened it up and revealed the toasty, fragrant tortilla with Mexican cheese and chunks of beef.  *inhale*  A small nibble and my taste buds were telling me to stop multi tasking and just eat.  The tortilla was darn near perfect tonight.  The cheese was buttery, and not too much either.  And the ideal amount of tender beef was included.  The green salsa caught me by surprise tonight.  A little fire there.  I used almost an entire bullet for a half of my meal.  I don't understand, I really wasn't that Hungry tonight.\nI still had to have some red salsa.  I was torn.  The quesadilla was delicious by itself.  Warm, toasty tortilla with cheese and beef.

Very good but I would have liked more basil flavor, it was very light. The bell peppers & everything were cut to a perfect bite size.

Housekeeping changed them, still ripped, just in a different place. Every time housekeeping was in the room they left something. A rag one day, a bottle of cleaning solution another one.

547,"This State Farm agent and his employees have certainly let me down.\n\nWe started our shopping for insurance on January 3.   After fielding numerous offers, the best price for the coverage we searched for came from State Farm in Scottsdale.  While other State Farm agencies replied as well, Shelbi at this agency knocked everyone else down with her outstanding ($388 for 6 months) price.\n\nI guess I should have started to worry when I received another 'We have a great price for you' email from Shelbi, which felt like she had no awareness it was being sent.   This one quoted the same coverage for $560 for 6 months.   \n\nI replied to the email offering $388.  Over the next 15 days, Shelbi and I emailed back and forth, my providing drivers' license numbers and the VIN number.  As we already have renters coverage under another company, I asked about the price of the policy without the renters coverage, and Shelbi advised we would pay $439.00.  Finally, January 15, Shelbi asked about my payment.  I asked if we could complete everything online or if she required a signature.  She replied that we could complete the transaction online.  I emailed the credit card information.\n\nFor the next 3 days, I was again asked for the credit card information and sent it again and again.  Finally, on the 19th, the date coverage was to commence, I received yet another email requesting my payment information.  Replying again, I got an autoresponse that Shelbi was out of the office through the following Monday.  If I had concerns, I could call the 800 number for State Farm customer care.  \n\n11:30 PM, when I read the email, I came to the realization that I had been driving all day uninsured.  I called the 800 number and asked the representative if I could pay for my insurance with him.  He searched me up in his system and said he found my $560 for 6 months coverage quote.  I asked him to search again, as I was quoted $439.  He tipped and tapped a second and confirmed he found the right quote.  He asked me for a credit card.  I started to provide my American Express number, only to be told that State Farm does not accept American Express.  OK...I got the MasterCard out and gave the number.  \n\nOnce processing was completed, the representative said \""""The quote you had has actually gone up a little.  It's $455.86, and you are covered.\""""  I asked when I would receive my proof of insurance documents, only to be told \""""It will take a couple of days\"""".  I asked if something could be sent to me by email, and the representative said \""""We don't usually do business that way\"""".  I reminded him that I had driven a full day with no insurance, and it would not be acceptable to wait 2 more days to be legal.  He asked his manager, and I received my proof of insurance email a moment later.\n\nI called the office the following morning.  The 'agent', Dusty, was unavailable, as was Shelbi.  I asked for a call back from the agent.  Next, I called Geico.  They got me the same coverage for $51 less in 15 minutes.  After I got my proof of coverage email from Geico, it was time to call and cancel State Farm.  Chris, the representative who answered my phone, wanted to ask questions about why I would cancel my just-purchased coverage.  I replied that I would answer his questions as soon as he cancelled my coverage.  \n\nOnce cancelled, he asked what changed about my satisfaction.  I told him the price changed 3 times, and I drove around for a day uncovered.  He wanted to ask other questions, and I renewed my request for Dusty, the agent, to call me back.  I called at 9:15 AM and did not get a call back from Dusty until 2 PM.\n\nNEVER AGAIN!",0

550,"As an avid coffee fan, I have to say that Caribou has won me over. They have free Wi-Fi, which is great if you find yourself in the area and you need to do some work via computer. When you walk in the door, you feel like you've left the Southside and entered a cozy ski lodge. They even have a fireplace surrounded by big, comfy chairs -definitely a plus when you're looking for a place to relax and sip on some espresso. \n\nOne of the cool things about Caribou is that it has a wider variety of menu items than your typical coffee shop. The oatmeal (try their Blueberry Almond flavor, so good!), breakfast sandwiches and snacks are much better than what you can get at your local Starbucks. If you're not a coffee person, Caribou also has some really good flavored teas. Overall, a great place to get your caffeine fix.",1

I've had the Newk's \""""Q\"""", the Roast Beef, and the Pimiento Cheese (with homemade pimiento cheese and really hard to beat!).\n\nBut, I'm in a \""""reducing\"""" mode at the moment (way too many calories consumed in San Francisco!!) so I've been leaning toward salads and soups.  They have a different selection of soups every day and I've had several of them!  My favorite is still the Fire Roasted Tomato!  But just check out the list; you're bound to find one that sings for you!!  I tried the Garden Vegetable Soup today, and was very pleased!  It tasted great and check out the nutrition chart - only 80 calories per 8 oz serving!  Win!!  So, with the Half Soup and Half Salad deal (I selected the Caesar Salad), I had a low cal, tasty and very filling meal!!\nThey have several (Count 'em - 10!!!) menu salads,each with it's own personality and taste combination.  And if you just can't find what you want on the list, order your own salad combination!\n\nMy wife likes the pizza (and sometimes I'll have a slice too!).  Her favorite, and mine too, is the Spicy Chicken.  Now the pizza isn't going to help your calorie count if you sit there and eat the whole thing, so share it!!\n\nI think this is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte!  And fortunately for me, there are locations near my house, and downtown where I work!  I'll see you there!!!",1
555,"I'm delayed in my review, I went to Fizz the end of November after the Rod Stewart concert. \nI knew it was new and couldn't wait to check it out. I arranged to meet friends there and we had a blast! \nWe were greeted  & given a table right away (there was only 1 open). I was surprised they were so accommodating since we weren't doing bottle service or anything. \nThe server was very nice and helpful. I ordered the Le Fizz and later switched to the Fizz Fraise. Prices are typical strip lounge rates. So don't complain, you should know it's not going to be cheap walking in! \nThe space is small and intimate. Very sexy! Easy to have conversation and mingle. The DJ was great also, kept the vibe upbeat with out being too loud. \nIt's fun to walk around and look at the decor and rare art pieces that are from Elton's private collection. This is definitely going to be the place to hang after any show at the Collosseum. There were several members of the band hanging out with friends and family. \nCan't wait to have a schmancy reason to go back!",1
556,"I was pretty excited to stay at SAMs town for the night with my husband, because we used to come here on dates when we were teenagers and it was so nice. We stayed here last night and it was ridiculous. The check in line was a good hour of waiting because there were only two very slow people working the desk. When I checked into the room, I realized that my neighbors were the neighbors from hell and the entire hallway reeked of marijuana. The room was cozy but dusty and a bit run down. There are very few channels to choose from on tv. At 6:00 AM we woke up to our neighbors' kids ringing our hotel door bell repeatedly and when we finally got up and took care of that and fell back asleep, housekeeping knocked at the door at 7:30 asking to clean our room when we had the so not disturb sign up. She was a lady who spoke terrible English and she just went from door to door yelling \""""housekeeepppiiiinnngggggg\"""" waking everyone. It felt like we were staying in some really ghetto apartments. Never ever again will we return. Awful, dingy and ghetto hotel. Awful. Next time we will go to the MGM, trump or something else.",0
557,"Motel 6 with a broken down elevator. No wifi, food sucked and everything was way overpriced. WAY overpriced. The bed was comfortable. The pillows were not. The air conditioner doesn't have a thermostat in the wall. Way way outdated rooms. 25 inch tv?????  Look elsewhere.  Oh yeah, there's not enough parking for the guests let alone casino visitors.  had to park 6 gazillion miles away every time and mostly on top of the garage in the sun.  Bellagio was VERY nice, but I imagine you're gonna pay for it.",0
558,RESERVE A SEAT ON THE PATIO and dine while you watch the Bellagio water show. This is probably the best atmosphere on the strip. You are provided with as much fresh french bread as you can eat. The escargo was amazing. Entrees are OK- Very basic french items such as skirt steak and frites. Bread pudding dessert was exceptional.,1
559,"Eh.  \nIt really was just OK.\nThe waitress let the dishes pile up on our table and didn't stop by often enough to refill drinks and check on us. The food took pretty long to prepare and there wasn't any apology or explanation.\n \nBecause we were meeting old friends, we were in a celebratory and lingering mood.  \nThe restaurant was empty but we felt pressure to leave. We tipped well, so I don't think that was the issue... The staff sure was quick to clear the table after the tab was paid. Oy. What an AWKWARD way to do business!\n\nThe hostess (kind of) made up for it, though. She took a bunch of tourist-y photos of our reunion.  (Outside the establishment, of course...)\n\nI definitely won't be revisiting this place.  There are just too many restaurant options out there, Landry's. Your food wasn't great enough to justify service like that.",0
560,"Food tastes like plastic!! What a place.. no customer service at all. The 2 girls behind the counter were absolutely rude. The tasteless food was overpriced.

You get charged $8 for a decent chicken n Shrimp fried rice!!",0
561,"I like this place...I have to say living within a 3 minute drive is prolly a key factor in us liking this place but it has good food, decent prices, and the environment is chill, modern and slightly upscale (but I still had on jean shorts and a tank top when eating dinner there with my baby and husband)\n\nWe have had the pizzas, salads (chop was good!) and their desserts were also good.  Decent food and convenient for us as a family to dine at.  \n\nTIP to restaurant: get better high chairs please!!!",1

563,"I skipped the gym so I can eat some deep-fried chicken and since I was in the area, I decided to give Strip N Dip a try. I never went here when it was still BFG so I will not be one of those people who would complain about the dang mural of chickens on the wall. \""""This place would've been 5 stars if they hadn't painted over the mural\""""...seriously? Did that mural make your food taste better?\n\nI was impressed by the super friendly service. I was surprised a chicken place had Thai tea so of course, I got that since I love Thai tea and it was pretty good. Since it was my first time, I wanted to try as many items as I can.  I went with the 6-pc combo with 1 side, garlic bread and 3 dips and added another side.\n\nChicken:\nYou choose from baked (with rotisserie seasoning), fried (breaded in panko) or grilled (marinated in Asian honey glaze). I got the panko-breaded fried chicken strips. It was light and not greasy. The chicken was cooked perfectly but still juicy. 4/5\n\nSide Dishes:\nThey have baked mac n cheese, French fries and grilled veggies.  I went with the mac n cheese and fries. The mac n cheese was delish with the melted mozzarella on top. The fries are crispy but you have to dip them in sauce to make them tasty - eating them sans sauce is pretty blah. 4/5\n\nSauces:\nYour options are BBQ, buffalo, cheese, wasabi cream, honey mustard, ranch, sweet chili, strip sauce and teriyaki. I tried the wasabi cream, strip sauce and ranch. Ranch was a stupid choice since you can get ranch anywhere but that was my back-up plan in case I didn't like the other sauces. It was ranch. The strip sauce was similar to Cane's dipping sauce so I liked it. I didn't like the wasabi cream. You can taste wasabi the first few seconds and then sweetness takes over. I'm not going to get that again. I have about 4 sauces that I'm willing to try next time I go. But for having lots of options for sauces... 4/5",1
564,"This was one of the best finds while in Montreal. I was with some friend and we were going to watch hockey at the Bell Centre, but wanted to get a few beers before the game. BM looks like a chain restaurant from the outside, but the food is really good quality and service is top notch. I suggest sitting on the first level either at the bar or in the back by the grill.\n\nWe went twice in one day and the service was awesome both times. Get the charcuterie! I highly recommend the Serrano Ham, pate, and potted chicken liver mousse. \n\nThey have a tremendous selection of beer. It seems like you really can't go wrong! There's an awesome tripel for only $5 although I can't remember the name. It's 9% alcohol. Ask for it.",1
565,"Probably the biggest disappointment I have had in Vegas. I have been to other restaurants from Gordon Ramsey and have enjoyed them. This one was a fail on most levels.\n\nI found the food to be pretty crappy. Not good flavor profiles at all. All my food was even bland at times. I tried nearly everything that our table of 6 got. Nothing really wowed me.\n\nThe service was slow. Not very attentive.\n\nThere were 2 positive notes. The sticky toffee pudding (which is one of my favs) was really excellent. I would go back only for desert just for that. I also like the sound track of British music playing.\n\nAside from that, I think Mr. Ramsey should take a page from some of his own TV shows and go in there and cuss people out for failing to run a good restaurant.  Whoever is in charge there needs a good yelling at.",0

I always finished up with their chili, but now it's an additional $3.49, and no more hot chocolate chip cookies.

Our waitress was very friendly and helpful the whole time, so service gets an A plus. The food was really good, but I also don't have anything to compare it to and can't vouch for it's authenticity - although, I'm sure it is pretty authentic according to other reviewers. I also had the pleasure of having the strudel, which was a bit too sweet for my taste, but still delicious. \n\nIt was a great experience, and I'll be sure to go back.

She gave me a number and I waited my turn. I already had the paperwork that my job gave me filled out. The time it took to pay for my Sheriff's card, take my pictures, take my fingerprints, and wait for the card was all but 25 minutes. \n\nThe only drawback is that they only accept cash.

This is not the cheapest place to have lunch, but it's the best, and I'm all about their farm-in-the-city philosophy.\n\nHere are my highlights:\n\n1. The pesto chicken sandwich. I order it without the bun, so it comes heaped with crisp dark lettuce, tomato, fresh sauteed mushrooms, and enough (house-made!) pesto to cover every bite.\n\n2. The sweet potato fries with spicy-sweet pineapple dipping sauce. Never have healthy sweet potatoes tasted almost unhealthily delicious.\n\n3. The onion rings.

We took my dad here as we were on a weekend celebration of his 60th birthday so my brother and I wanted to ensure he had the some of  the best experiences of his life on the trip. My good friend and fellow yelper Tal and his wife just happened to be in town and suggested we all meet here to experience one of his favorite places to eat. \n\nThe venue itself is simple yet amazing as it is nestled inside the MGM that is home to so many great restaurants. The staff was very friendly, from the hostess to the bartender and the many different wait staff that attended to our needs.\n\nWe all decided to go with the tasting menu, with my friends wife asking for the vegetarian tasting menu which I must say looked very good even for someone who is a meat and potatoes person. The wine list looked good from the peak I had at it, my friend ordered all three bottle of wine which were all fantastic, one of which was super pricey and I couldn't tell a huge difference between that and the less expensive bottles. The lobster pot pie was absolutely amazing, I would go back just to eat that again. I wasn't as impressed with the quail, although that is something I wouldn't normally order. The kobe beef was very good, although I wouldn't rank it up there as high as the steaks I had the night before just down the hall at craft steak. \n\nAlthough I had a good idea that this meal wasn't going to be a cheap one, I was still a bit sticker shocked when I received the check. I along with the rest of my group left dinner very satisfied with all aspects of the meal.",1

So I figured I would more than make up for the price by gorging on crab legs.  But the crab legs were old and chalky.  Yuk!  No flavor at all.\n\nI know what to expect at Todai but this particular one was very disappointing.  If you are ever in Honolulu, that Todai is the absolute best I've ever had.",0
578,"U.S. National Whitewater Center\n5000 Whitewater Center Parkway\nCharlotte, NC  28214\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nI made an honest mistake this evening at the US National Whitewater Center, a business I've supported since its grand opening in 2006.  The manner in which the situation was handled left my wife and I stranded with two dogs, no way to get home, and cost hundreds of dollars to correct.  As a business owner who values their patrons, there is no way my customers would receive this kind of treatment. \n\nOn Thursday evenings there is a large turnout.  Tonight was no exception; the parking lots are full.  As you drive near front entrance there are people going back and forth to their cars with: kids, dogs, lawn chairs, church buses, taxis, etc entering the facility.  To the right of the main entrance there are a few parking areas in a dirt lot.  This is the area where I have parked my car for years.  When the area gets full people routinely park beside the roadway in the grass.  Tonight this is where I parked.   What I did not notice in the midst of the commotion upon entering was the addition of signage stating no parking past this point.   As we parked the car a USNWC employee was standing 15 feet away looking directly at me, who smiled as we gathered our two dogs and exited the car.  We then let the dogs visit a few trees, still a stone's throw from the employee and the car.  Upon leaving at 8:45pm I noticed the car was not there.   First thought was it had been stolen, then I saw the signs \""""no parking, towing enforced\"""".   I then wondered how many times I have parked there before with that sign glaring at me.\n\nThe front desk keeps tabs on cars they have towed, so it didn't take long to discover that was what happened.   They provided me with the towing company's information.   I've never been towed before, so I had no idea what to expect.   The conversation with the towing company was very disturbing. Yes, we have your car but we close in 15 minutes and if you aren't here before then, you cannot get it until tomorrow.   The USNWC isn't exactly bustling with taxis at this point in time, nor is it very close to anything.   A taxi was dispatched immediately, but who knows how long that takes.   I told the towing company I would call them back as soon as I was on my way.  Several employees from the USNWC were nearby and overheard how cumbersome all this had quickly become.  \n\nWhat now had to happen: get a cab for my wife and I plus two large dogs, get to the towing company in 15 minutes, have hundreds of dollars (cash only), provide proof of registration, proof of insurance, copy of driver's license.  Time was the biggest concern as there was just no way manage all this and have any hopes of getting my car back this evening.   I had never thought of it before, but taxi's are not pet friendly.   When it showed up, I took the taxi and my wife plus dogs stayed behind waiting for friends on the east side of Charlotte to pick them up.   By the time I arrived at the towing company, the owner agreed to have someone onsite, provided I met their requirements to retrieve my car.  Friends met me there with cash, I had my insurance card matching the VIN of the car, have my car keys, had paperwork in the car with my name and address on them.  With all this, plus me being frantic and stranded at the location they towed my car from: \""""No can do without: title, bill of sale, or registration receipt\"""".   Given I want all of these to be in a safe place, I do not keep them in the car.  Long story short, I'm not getting my car tonight and I will not make that business meeting at 8am across town.   Having said all that, I realize that I parked in a spot marked no parking. \n\nIn between realizing my car had been towed and the taxi showing up, I spoke to the manager of the USNWC about my situation.  I asked how long the no parking signage had been there.   He advised it was installed about one month ago.  There is little point in debating the merits of the circumstance at this point because the damage is done.  Nevertheless, I asked if they knew the policy was recently changed, would it be reasonable to put a sticky note on my window indicating the policy recently changed and you cannot park here anymore.  No answer.\n\nWhy did I write this in the first place?  For starters, I'm upset for not seeing the sign and for parking where I shouldn't have.   What upsets me more is a business I had a connection with for years let me down.   Respect for one's customers is what every business should strive for.  A simple warning sticky-note on the window, or a yell \""""hey read that sign\"""" would have made my day.  Instead I may never return to a place I have hung out with friends for years.  I hold no illusion my experience will affect business there one way or another.   More than anything I find it disrespectful.   I believe those actions give insight to the inner workings of the facility and how its customers are valued.",0

580,"Tropical themed restaurant.  Been here for buffets which were decent.  Wanting to avoid the long buffet line, we opted to be seated for the cafe.  Getting seats for 6 seemed to be a challenge.  We were directed to the back and was told someone would be waiting for us to seat us.  Alas, no one was so we just seated ourselves.  What appeared to be confusion as another server asked us if we were supposed to be seated there or not.  Turns out, it was the right place.  Anyway, we waited....hmmmm... quite a while.  It seemed longer withTWO antsy toddlers who weren't shy about declaring their state of hunger.  The waiter hurriedly walked by and said he'd be right there.  He appeared to be on the verge of a hissy fit.   \nWe waited AGAIN even longer.  Finally, annoyed with the wait since we had just arrived to Vegas after roadtripping 5 hours, I walked over to the waiter station and asked for someone to bring us drinks.  \nA minute later, our huffy server shows up with no greeting and asks us for our drink order.  We were already ready to order.  \nAgain,  another long wait.  I looked at my watch and noticed it's been over 20 minutes with NO DRINKS!  This has been my worst experience at the Fremont Hotel.  Again, I walked over to the wait station and asked for assistance. \nAbout another few minutes go by and then our drinks arrive.  No apology or explanation about the delay.  \nThen our food arrives.  Now, the food was ok.  The American cuisine was pretty good.   But how do you screw up a patty melt or fried saimin noodles anyway? The Asian iterations could have been better.  The Korean ribs were not authentic.  Ok,if you like your bbq really sweet or never had true Korean marinated ribs.  \nWe noticed patrons who arrived long after us who already received their drinks and their food arrived at about the same time as ours.  NICE....\nWhile we were finishing up our food, the server tells us he's going on a break and that \""""so and so\"""" would take care of us.  Well it was a while before we saw this person since usually, we're introduced to the new server.\nAnyway, this new server couldnt have been nicer.  She had a friendly disposition and almost simulataneously, hubby and I exclaimed we should have had her as our server plus our original server was going on a break?   It appeared he went on a break while we waited for our drinks.  Funny thing is, we devoured our food and was out of there so soon after we received our entrees.   \nThe new server was more empathatic and tried to explain how slammed they were with a new cook and that the previous patrons gave our server a difficult time.  My point was that it doesnt take THAT long to bring drinks and explain the situation.  Plus, why are we being punished because of other high maintenance sh**heads!!!  If the food was really crappy, I would give 1 star but the buffets I've experienced in the past were decent.  At the rate we were going, we could have just waited for the buffet...it may have been faster!",0
581,"We stayed at the Rumor for my bffs bday and it was a fine stay but we accidentally left some things behind in our hurry to get things tidied up.... and upon going back to ask if the stuff had been found (which should most likely be immediately after cleanup since they were the next people in the room) we were told it hadnt shown up as yet. We checked out yesterday. So why wasnt it turned in immediately after clean up? and I know that we left it because I didnt unplug my brookstone charger to put in my bag and no one checked the closet for the clothes that were there before we left. So this bums me out. I hate forgetting things when staying away from home but its even more sad that when you leave it at a hotel, then its just gone forever because the staff gets to keep it (or whatever the arrangement is for lost and found). So I had to post this comment here because I believe that the lost and found is as much of the experience as anything else we were catered to and if someone drops the ball like this, maybe something will be done to better serve from this aspect.\nThank you,\nTonya",0
582,"Incredibly busy and crowded, but a great store still. \n\nSo I began my relationship with this Apple store location in 2007 when I bought a MacBook. They have serviced it accordingly, giving me several keyboards (when they were proven to be faulty), helping me on upgrades (including sending me elsewhere to save money), and showing me other products, like the iPhone and iPad, which I would eventually buy. \n\nThe Genius Bar is a good place to get help. I've been here several times and each time they were pretty quick and usually inexpensive. A couple of times they took longer but overall I am happy with the results. I've spent some money at this store for sure. Fixing issues with my computer, buying new devices, and getting accessories have all been things I've done at this Apple store. \n\nMy only true gripe about this location is the fact that sometimes MANY people are shopping at the same time for devices and waiting for someone in a blue shirt to \""""open up\"""" availability can be stressful and time consuming. On several occasions I've waited and waited only to be told that everyone is busy and they'll \""""get to me when they can\"""". \n\nDespite the long waits for service and for help with new devices (sometimes), I would still rate this location pretty well overall.

590,"I wish I could give nagtive stars!!!! Please stay away from this place.  I went there 20 days ago.  The doctor gave me a prescription that lasted 3 days.  At that time they drew blood and was told that the results will be sent to my primary care physician within a week.  I just called today inquiring about my lab results as my doctor has not received it.  The person on the phone acted like i was bothering him and told me, without even looking at my records, that it normally takes up to 1 month to get lab results.  i then asked if he could at least look, was agitated by this some how, and said that he does not have time to look right now but took my name and number and said that someone will call me when they can get to it.\n\nAbsolutely absurd!!!",0

Not necessarily the healthiest. I feel like they are packed with sugar.\n\nThe salads are nice. When you ask for the dressing on the side, they happily oblige. The chicken is moist, and juicy. Like a nice....piece of chicken.\n\nMy only gripe...is the service can be a touch slow. I didn't knock them down any stars for this because it's not their fault for being understaffed. There needs to be another Conmigo in the building. \n\nAll in all....good times, good food.",1

The romance of a top-notch Italian menu, phenomenal service from a knowledgeable waitstaff who pride themselves on passion for the food they serve make it hard to choose your dinner quickly.

They have some \nawesome tiramisu and muffins here. They are also a great bakery.\n\nIf you find yourself on this side of town, I would recommend you give this place a go. I do not think you will be disappointed.\n\nThey also have free Wi-Fi:)",1
595,"If you love wine--or boozy frozen desserts--you need to check this place out--stat!\n\nI stopped in with some friends this past Sat. evening to pick up a couple of growlers of cider.  I'd already had their raspberry ale at Fat Heads, which was delicious, and which excited me for what was to come.  After sampling a few of their offerings, we collectively decided on the Archibald's amber and Concord grape.  Both were on the sweeter side, but weren't as sweet as I was expecting (esp. for the grape)--in a good way.  I actually prefer semi-sweet alcoholic beverages to cloyingly sweet ones, so this was perfect for me!\n\nSince it was pretty packed at the time we stopped in (7:30pm), we decided to take the growlers back to one of our places to drink.  This also gave us the opportunity to order some pizza to soak up the booze.  I really enjoyed the flavors of both of the ciders we ordered--both were quite rich and complex.  If I had to choose a favorite, it would be the grape, due to the depth of the flavor.  The raspberry cider I had at Fat Heads actually tasted more like red wine than it did--its flavor was really unique.  My friends also really enjoyed both of the ciders, as attested by the fact that both growlers were pretty much dry after 1.5-2 hrs.\n\nMy favorite thing that I bought here, however, was the sorbet.  At the time I stopped in, they were serving the concord grape, and it was delicious!  It was much sweeter than the concord grape cider, but it was so refreshing and made the perfect dessert.  I offered all of my friend spoonfuls except for the one driving--unfortunately, she didn't get to try it since I'd greedily eaten it all up in the 15 min. it took to arrive at our destination.  I'll definitely be stopping in here for an occasional boozy sweet treat from now on--just watch out for me swerving on my bike on the way back to my place!",1
596,"This was such a great meal in Las Vegas! The dessert was the best.\n\nMy girlfriends and I purchased a travelzoo deal for a four course dinner and champagne for $89/couple. We made reservations ahead of time and were seated soon after we arrived. Each of us had a glass of champagne, and our meal started off with a salmon appetizer, followed by a choice of apple walnut salad or clam chowder, and both were delicious and filling. They also gave us biscuits and cornbread at the table. Our main course was cioppino, which was huge and full of shrimp, mussels, fish, and prawns. It also had large pieces of pasta, which we didn't eat as there was way too much food.\n\nNow to the best part: for dessert, we had an ice cream mystery game. 16 mystery flavors in an array of colors and smells were presented to us in small scoops, along with a blank answer sheet. The flavors varied from delicious nutella, mai tai, and pistachio to gawd-awful sriracha sauce (yes, the Asian cock sauce-- which deceivingly looked like mango), celery (I TOTALLY thought it was going to be lime and was DISASTROUSLY wrong), and tomato (I initially thought it was rotten sorbet). It was fun and we all had a blast playing the game. \n\nWe left full, barely buzzed, and excited for the rest of the evening. A great dining experience!",1
597,"3.5 stars, rounded up.\n\nMy family and I decided to escape from the touristy buffet scenes on the strip and wanted to find where the locals go to get their grub. It was around brunch time and found the Omelet House on my Yelp app, sounds good!\n\nThe ambiance had the homey feeling, with the picture frames and figurines on the wall. The chairs were sort of janky, but I didn't care. For the food, they have a large selection of entrees, especially for the omelettes. My parents ordered off the omelette menu and my brother had the $5.99 breakfast special. They also have other breakfast options if you're not an omelette fan like me. I ordered the huevos rancheros.\n\nThe food came out and wow, the omelettes my parents ordered were GINORMOUS! How many eggs do they use to make a serving? Looked like half a dozen. It also came along with potatoes that are sliced into coin shapes, such an interesting take on homefries. However, my brother $5.99 breakfast special looked so small, which my parents donated some of their omelette for him. My huevos rancheros was perfectly portioned and loved it. the tortilla chips were a great addition to scoop up the refried beans, salsa and runny egg yolk on the plate. My parents couldn't finish their omelettes even though they gave a portion to my brother. \n\nOverall, great hole-in-a-wall joint. Definitely recommend those who are bulking up on protein or just simply love eggs.",1
598,"I went here last night to attend the show Stars in Concert.  I had been to this theatre about 7 years ago for another show.  The theatre has been changed some since that time and the changes are good.\n\nThis venue is really a great, smaller venue.  There are about 40 round tables on the floor each seating 4 people.  In addition, there are 5 rows of theatre style seats in the back.  I sat in the first row here, and it was very comfortable and I had great sight lines.  Again, it's a small venue so you can see well wherever you are.  The theatre has good sound and the lighting was well done for the show.  \n\nThere's a lounge area with bar before you enter the theatre so if you're early, you can have a drink and relax.  Seating was done promptly 15 minutes before show time.  The employees I came into contact with last night were all very pleasant with great smiles and were very helpful from ticketing to seating.\n\nThe only drawback may be finding the place the first time you go there.  You need to remember you enter a small alley just north of Walgreens and before McDonalds.  Parking is available behind the theatre and it's a short distance down this alley.\n\nA word about the show.  I came to see Stars in Concert which is in its first week at this theatre.  The show was very good.  Rotating impersonators sing live music of famous people.  There was a 4 piece band on a platform raised above the stage.  Last night, there were impersonators of Tina Turner, Michael Jackson, Elton John, Beyonce, Whitney Houston, and the Soul Brothers.  All music is live.  There is no lip syncing!  Not a bad show at all.\n\nI'll be back for another show which goes on earlier.",1
599,"I first went here when I was at college as it was round the corner. The delicious smell lured me in. The shop is just a porta-cabin with a heap of biscuits in bags.\n\nI was amazed that you could buy something like 3 kilos of 'broken' biscuits for \u00a32. They came in plastic bags so didn't look great, but the biscuits themselves were lovely.\n\nNow my favourite is individual bags of mini Cadbury's fingers. You can buy a massive sackful for \u00a31.50. Opening hours are fairly limited.",1
600,I have been going here for years. It is nice but poorly managed!!  There is a 2 dog rule and people bring 3-5 dogs to one person.  They do NOTHING about the aggressive dogs that attack other dogs there!  People do not pick up their dog waste which can contribute to your dog getting sick.  There are rules at this park clearly posted but they are NOT followed and the People running that dog park DONT ENFORCE the rules. They could care less.,0

I put my trust completely in Sandy's magical hands. With a lion's mane and a personality just as bold, she is a hoot. She is not one of those stylists who rush you in and out, but takes time to assess, ask for what you are going for, and suggest some slight modifications if necessary. If you are in a hurry, I do not suggest this place, because she is meticulous. \n\nThe staff in this establishment are all friendly and lively. It is a welcoming environment.",1

604,"Stay away from this place. This place is trash. The dentist doesn't know what she is doing at all. It seem like she is just graduated and has no experiences whatsoever. I had such a bad experience with this place from the beggining to the finish. I just had my root carnal a month ago. I was in so much pain during the whole process. It took 3 hours to finish the whole thing. I knew my teeth was that bad and it was just a root carnal. One day after the process, I was in so much pain that I had to take pain releive pill. I couldn't chew or even drink cold water. A few days later, my tooth had a small hole. So I had to go back to and get it fixed. I have never had this bad experience with a dentist like this before. I should've have stayed with my old dentist who has a lot more experiences. More than that the dentist is a bitch. She just wants your money. This place is hell. Stay away from it.",0
605,"A bit underwhelming. Everything was under seasoned, but was rich. So it was heavy on your palette but had  little flavor.\n\nI got the Hubert Keller burger, modified to kobe beef and smoked gouda. Couldn't taste the cheese, couldn't taste the meat, all i could taste was the steamed spinach, which was off setting.\n\nQuick guide:\nBuffalo meat = more lean, robust meaty flavor -- recommended.\nKobe beef = Soft texture, under seasoned, very mild flavor.\n\nI'd try a different burger place in vegas before I return.",0

607,"Ultimate Body Bootcamp is the only thing that has ever worked for me as far as a workout routine. I am not a typical \""""gym\"""" person. I got a Groupon way back in 2010 and only thought I would do the month. I wound up signing up for much more. At the time I was recovering from a back injury and it was the only thing that helped me get stronger. After awhile I took some time off to have a child and didn't go back to UBBC until January 2013. At that time, I was so weak because I had been on bed rest with my pregnancy and had gained a bunch of weight. I never thought I would get back into shape. I was truly scared. I saw a post on Facebook for a UBBC challenge, emailed Richelle, the owner/trainer to tell her about my fear and how I had gained so much and my muscles had become so weak from my pregnancy. She eased my fears and said she would work with me.  I wound up losing. 20 lbs of baby weight in just 3 months.  I noticed I got stronger and my back felt better than it had since the 2011, the last time I was in bootcamp. \n\nThe thing that I like best about UBBC is the camaraderie and the one on one assistance and attention. The owner, Richelle posts nutrition articles, recipes, etc. on the Facebook page, and really wants people to succeed.  It is a fun atmosphere and people cheer each other on. The strength training Richelle teaches is awesome. I totally notice a difference in how I carry myself as a result.\n\nI have taken a couple months off to start a business, and I can tell my back has been bothering me again because I haven't been in bootcamp. I need to get back because it is the only thing that has worked for me, even after 1000s of dollars in chiropractic and massage therapies. This is a great local business that supports other local businesses. There are always posts on the UBBC website/FB page about giving to charities and helping out causes. Do not feel intimidated to try this out. Richelle works with people of all levels and there is no embarrassment.  I also love the variety of people and ages in the camps.",1
608,"A bit off the beaten path, but you'll find the best and most authentic Thai food in Scottsdale here. The Pad Thai is amazing, as is the pumpkin curry.

The restaurant is clean and decorated in a cheery and authentic Thai style, with Thai costumes adorning the walls. Light lavender shades of cheerful go hand-in-hand with the service with a smile you will find at Cha Da Thai. The Thai iced coffee is delicious. I will definitely be back!",1
609,"As most people, we were here for a convention, the annual NATCA convention - and it's no wonder it won't be held here again.  This is a very low quality-high priced, dated hotel, despite being bought by Caesars Entertainment.  \n\nThe casino ambiance is on-par with CircusCircus; low slung ceiling with years of cigarette smoke permeating everything, acres of frumpy people glued to video gambling.\n\nRio automatically charged us an $18 per-day 'resort fee' for a closed pool and uselessly weak WiFi.\n\nThe hike to the Strip turned out to be a hassle, as Rio's shuttle drops you off at either the rear parking area of Ballys or the back parking garage of Harrahs - & you could wait 20+ minutes on either end of these no-man-lands.\n\nThere's nothing interesting in the Rio's vincinity.  We hiked across glass-strewn abandoned parking lots to the Palms Hotel, for its movie theater --that's about it.\n\nThe mediocre buffet was $30-35 dinner --$17- (kids) $25 for breakfast.\n\nFor this, our Rio room was nearly $200/night.

613,"Jos. A Banks is a high end men's formal wear store.  Since it's high end, steep prices are expected.  What's not expected is how bland the store's collection of clothing is.  \n\nMen's formal wear shops are fairly generic, with the cut of the cloth and the quality of the material used in the clothing determining the price.  As a result, I judge these stores based on the ties they carry.  A high-priced suit can come from many places, but the quality of the store hinges on the ties in my opinion.\n\nAnd that's where Jos. A Banks fails.  Conservative suits do not require a flat or dull tie in order to maintain their formal nature.  On a dark suit or gray suit, a tie can make the outfit, bringing style to what is designed to look like a cookie cutter outfit in business.  But the collection of ties at Jos. A. Banks is awful.  The colors are drab, the designs on the tie are the same as the ones in the early 1980s and the prices are ridiculous.  \n\nFor a suit, it's a decent place, but stay away from the ties.",0
614,"I love the all day happy hour on Sundays and Tuesdays, sushi can get so pricey, so to come here and have a reasonable bill and its yummy, is awesome. Plus being in Anthem, I always feels so limited on choices and this is a good one. \nWe ordered yellowtail, tuna, and salmon nigiri, tempura, edamame, and the Vegas roll and Philly roll. I read some other reviews that said the fish wasn't fresh, but that was not the case for us. Nor has it ever been any of the times I've been there. The nigiri was really good, and so was the tempura. The rolls weren't the best I've ever had but they were decent. Service was quick, and our server was super on top of things. \nOverall, I really like it and would not hesitate to return. I will stick with Sundays and Tuesdays because the prices were so good.",1

617,"I had heard about Gullifty's even before I moved to Pittsburgh.  It has the reputation of a charming neighborhood spot with very good desserts.  Many claim their desserts are the best in Pittsburgh.  My recent visit there was not  memorable, not particularly bad but nothing to write home about (sorry ma.). I give them props for making their own desserts in house but despite the large selection, too many options seem like something you could get at Eat n Park or Applebee's in a slightly more commercialized  form.  Oreo, peanut butter, brownies on top- Don't get me wrong- this sounds decadent but it's date night, not my post-toke meal at Dairy Queen.  With that said, the desserts we had were pretty tasty.  Not best of Pittsburgh tasty, however.  I would have liked some more creative options.  The savory options were basically your usual diner entrees but the variety and flavor were both decent.  The service was average, friendly but untrained.  As for the decor, they need a facelift badly.  It looks like 1985 in there and not in a pleasingly retro sort of way.  There is a small but adequate selection of microbrews which is certainly a positive.  I think if I come back to Gullifty's any time soon, it would probably be for a late night slice of pie or coffee.  Otherwise,it's a pretty run of the mill establishment.",0
618,"So let's just be clear, if your looking for decent service, you should go somewhere else. The service is the BIGGEST problem with the restaurant.  However, if your looking for an amazing wing sauce, and some of the best house made blue cheese and possibly a cold draft beer selection, then and only then will you want to go to this establishment ( to say they're as welcoming and friendly as the old mean lunch lady (and not Chris Farley's version), would be an understatement). I walk in and there are 3 hostesses or employees standing at the host stand talking and do not bother to turn around and greet me or say HI!, so I walk past them and seat myself. OOOO-K...Then I sit at the bar and I look at the clock, it took the bartender 6 minutes to greet me. I worked in this industry and for a table it was a minute, but for door greetings, bar greeting, store greetings, a customer should be greeted within 30 seconds. A hi, hello, be with you, SMILE, ANYTHING! Comes over does not apologize for the wait. I almost feel bad promoting how good the wings are because I do not believe in giving business to an establishment that doesn't pride them self in service.  If i had a great experience with service this place could be a 4 or 5! Now I do to-go only!",0

629,"My attitude about Ale Asylum was a little bit skewed as I walked into their bar on Saturday.  When I first heard they were opening a new location I was very excited, but when I saw the ginormous building going up on Packers Avenue, my excitement peaked to giddiness.  Sadly, Ale Asylum missed the mark on a few key upgrades that were missing at the old location.\n\nAle Asylum may have become their own worst enemy.  With their beers available in bottle or on tap at many popular Madison restaurants, they needed to make their new location something really special.  Though the new building and in-house beer are special, the food and service are lacking.  They really needed to step up their menu.  When I heard a few months back they were hiring a kitchen manager, visions of a delicious and sinister version of the Great Dane menu danced through my head.   Unfortunately, all I got was a large font, one page menu of salads and sandwiches.  Yes, they have pizza too, but it is all pre-made by Falbos Brothers and brought into the kitchen to be cooked later.  Meh.  I'll pass\n\nDrinking their spectacular beer usually makes me hungry for a yummy treat, so I went ahead and ordered their fish tacos.  Sadly, the only side available without paying more was chips and salsa.  Really?  Chips and salsa?  That's the bare minimum I would expect from the low-quality fare at Pedros.   I upgraded to the side salad for an extra dollar, and got spring mix with two pale slices of tomato, diced red onions, and shredded cheese straight from the bag.  Again, meh.    \n\nThe tacos were light and delicious, but lacked some seasoning.  I would definitely order them again if I found myself there again.  The roasted beet salad was also plentifully sprinkled with cheese and beets, but sparsely dressed with their vinagrette.  I shared my dressing from my salad, which made my co-diner's experience more enjoyable. \n\nAnother note:  We were there around noon, and the bartenders were drinking pretty consistently the entire time we were there (about 2 1/2 hours).  Very unprofessional...but it seemed like managers were around, so I guess they aren't very concerned about that.\n\nOverall:  Sorry Ale Asylum.  I would rather go to a better restaurant that serves your beer than your own brewery.  I'll consider coming back if I hear through the grapevine about a kitchen and staff upgrade.",0
630,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I waited over an hour to get my fill. They said it would be \""""just a few minutes\"""". I would have just left but they put my friends feet in the water for her pedicure so we were trapped. She was in the water 30 minutes before they came to her. I also watched them give a full face wax to a woman. They didn't take her in the back room or anything. Just did it right there in front of everyone.",0
631,"Nah. I forked over $13 for a club sandwich, mac 'n' cheese, and a large Pepsi.  The mac 'n' cheese was good, and the sandwich was just okay.  I say take your $13 and go to Texaz Grill!!!  WAY better food, and for $13 you can get dessert too.",0
632,"While the atmosphere, food, and drink were beyond expectations, the service left a lot to be desired. From the moment we walked in the door we were treated badly. The hostess was rude to us and then our waitress was also rude.\n\n There were several open tables, but service was slow. 30 minutes to get drinks when we had a clear view of them sitting on the bar. My friend politely told the waitress that she thought she had been given the wrong beer. Her response was, \""""No, that's what you ordered!\"""" I have really never been treated like this anywhere in my life. \n\nOverall, I don't want to go back, but may give it a second chance. I don't see this place making it past 1 year.",0
633,"Some things never change.. unfortunately, RA on Mill Ave. is one of them. \n\nI went the other night for a Graphic Design networking event which involved drink tickets and my god, the bartenders could not have been more pissed that I ordered anything other than beer with them. If I would have known a Long Beach Ice Tea was such a pain in the ass I would have stuck with $1 Happy Hour Sake & Sopporo, but whatever. Sushi there is mediocre, I had a few different rolls, and nothing seemed very fresh. I cant say it was bad, but i've had much better in the valley. I think the appeal of this place is the happy hour specials they offer.. they do have good deals but overall I think RA cares more about image than good service & quality food.",0
634,"Did not care about it... This place is dark, extremely dark. I understand what they are trying to do, but you can't read the menus, literally. \nFood was hit and miss, more miss than hit. Way too much dressing/seasoning masking the actual taste of what you eat. They promote \""""family style\"""" but quantity can not replace quality.",0
635,"I've been here several times, but most recently I went there with a girl friend who was visiting from Vegas.  We decided to stop in real quick and enjoy the happy hour specials.  The specials were fantastic, probably one of the best happy hours, but besides the pricing, the food and house margaritas were delicious.  The service was great (we had bartender Ben who was awesome).  We even met local Charlie who let us try one of his special flour tortilla chips that we were curious about;  which were great.  If you're an enchilada fan, I would suggest getting one chicken and one cheese and mixing them.  We found the combination to be great together.  The cheese crisp and fideo are always a favorite too.  I find the 'water park' as mentioned by another Yelper and the patio to give this restaurant it's charm.  If it wasn't summer, I'm sure we would have been out on the patio.",1
636,"My husband and I recently returned from a honeymoon in New Orleans craving the cuisine. Sadly, Lilliana's did not deliver. The oysters we had were overpriced and nothing close to what we had in NOLA, which I get. Wisconsin is nowhere near the ocean. But the andouille-crusted tilapia and sweet potato mash served with it were both bland and not worth the price at all. The meal as a whole was overpriced and a major disappointment.",0
637,"Very disappointed. Upon recommendation from someone else, I placed an order to rent a GPS for an international trip two weeks ahead of time. I received an email that the order was received and that I would get a tracking number as soon as it was shipped. Unfortunately, when they never happened I called. Had to leave a message but no one called back. I called again only to find out that they were out of the product but had never bothered to tell me. Had I known sooner, I could have gotten one from someone else. As it is, I'm basically out of luck. I was told to use my phone. Definitely not happy with this very poor service.",0
638,"Unfortunately I have to agree with all the negative reviews that have already been posted. It was my first time getting ANYTHING injected in my face. I was assured that if I purchased the full syringe of Restylane I would most definitely see the fullness in my lips. The first day I was extremely happy, my lips were exactly the way I wanted them. Second day there was a bit of swelling but I was aware that was going to happen. Third day, I woke up, looked in the mirror and my lips were gone! Like nothing had ever been done. Of course, I decided to call them and let them know that I was unhappy with the fact that I just spent $300? and on day 3 you couldn't even tell the difference. 3 people asked me that day \""""didn't you get your lips done? Cause I can't tell at all. They look exactly the same as they did before you got them done!\"""" \nWhen I called the  girl I spoke to said exactly this: \""""sorry you're unhappy with the results but we don't give the money back!\"""" No concern, and no offer to make anything right! Well at this point I'm pissed and I wish I read the reviews on here before I chose this doctor. I'm going to call one more time and request that they make it right or I will be reporting this doctor and his practice to the BBB. Please don't go here, and don't waste your money. I believe it's worth paying a little bit more elsewhere to get the results you want.",0
639,"Nowhere inspires my wrath more than Tempe Marketplace, except maybe a Super Walmart parking lot. But I think they're building one of those here, too.

641,"I know it seems ridiculous to not only take the time to review a chain corporately-owned restaurant as popular as Chipotle, but also to award it five entire stars, but I felt pretty strongly that I needed to.  Chipotle has been a long-time staple of my diet, and I have ventured to it, nationwide.  However, this location is by leagues the most consistent that I visit, and I go at least once a week, since it is local to both my office and my home.  Service is always quick, even during the weekday lunch rush, and I never have to call ahead.  Also, there is one fantastically sweet and positive employee who works the cash register, and considering that we have a conversation every time I'm in, I can't believe I don't know her name.  Whatever. The point is that I am always a Chipotle fan, but I know I'm going to have a hard time adjusting to a new neighborhood Chiptole when I leave this neighborhood... and when you find yourself saying that about a fast food restaurant, you know they've made a real impression.",1
642,SOOOOOOOOO disappointed with the Culinary Dropout.  I came here not once but twice in the same weekend.  \n\nThe first was for beers (a good selection) and enjoyed the artichoke (if a bit watery) and the soft pretzels bites with (really thin) provolone fondue. \n\nThe second time was for bunch on a Sunday.  Service was super slow and forgetful. The worst part was the biscuits and sausage gravy.  It was tomato-y.  TOMATO.  I just... *shivers* I don't want to talk about it.  It was a terrible experience.,0
643,"The staff acts uppity and pretentious as they serve you tiny portions that are totally overpriced in a dark setting that has a handful of tables. Food was decent but totally overshadowed by the bad attitudes. We asked for a table to be cleaned so we could sit in a chair with a back and since the waiter didn't feel like cleaning it, he said we could wait for 20 minutes until he got around to it even though the restaurant was almost empty. When asking to speak to Manager, they just left us standing for 15 minutes and no one ever came out. There is a lack of gratitude for their customers business' that is remarkable. I would never even consider going back to a place that treats you like they are doing you some favor to serve you and take your money.",0
644,"Like Chris and Jason mentioned before me, this place is a great and affordable way to get you and your 20+ friends, girlfriends, boyfriends, lovers, buck fuddies, etc a place to sleep and recharge in Vegas. Relatively walking distance from the strip and even a cab ride wouldn't be too pricey on those nights/days of immobile intoxication.\n\nThis place is also great for last minute bookings on not so busy nights. A group of us were able to get a room for $30... booked the day of. Awesome sauce!",1
645,"A lovely blend of old style exterior and modern interior, Just the Ticket strikes me as an ideal spot to pass a relaxing morning or afternoon.\n\nOverall, we said: \""""their soup was very good, the welcome very friendly, and the surroundings entirely conducive to whiling away an afternoon.

646,"Pretty whack for a Vegas buffet.  We decided to have dinner here before the Lion King show and were very disappointed.  This is no Wynn buffet.  It did have some good like the pizza, cold shrimp and bbq ribs.  The bad was the crab, tough and desserts were so boring and bland.  The only stand out was the tiramisu.  I did like that they have self pay machines, a quick swipe of your credit card and you're on your way... Also the service was nice and on point.  Sadly I can't say I'd ever come here again.",0
647,Long time customer who was informed by telephone that my rewards card was being revoked because I was not losing enough at the video poker machines.  I play about four hours a week but somehow they were not making enough money off my play or was somehow to lucky.  New management team run by Marrott has moved profit to the top of their list ahead of customer service.  I have since learned that I'm not alone in this new clean house of video poker players.  Seems that if you know what cards to hold before you redraw as some kind of a problem.  Saddly disapointed and will miss the workers who are very nice.,0
648,"The service here is horrible! The food is good, but doesn't make up for the terrible service, long waits, and sterile atmosphere. I went with a friend on a Sunday afternoon, before the lunch crowd. Even though the restaurant was half empty, we had to wait for a table and once we were seated, it took a while for someone to come greet us. \n\nA few of their menu items weren't available. After ordering, it took over forty minutes for our food to come... yes, over 40 minutes for 2 burgers and 2 orders of fries. When I asked the waitress, she responded that all orders take over 30 minutes and that she forgot to mention this to us when we were seated. An hour and $50 later, it was clear that In & Out Burger would have been the way to go.",0

Just like the prior review, I felt like I was bothering her. I ordered a combo slice and a coke. She put the plate down and went to take an order from the couple next to me. NO NAPKIN, NO FORK, NO KNIFE! Nothing. She could see that I was looking around but it did not phase her. I grabbed some naps and ate the pizza with my hands which normally is ok. This was a sloppy pizza and wanted the fork to pick up the topping that fell off.\n\nI finished my pizza and coke but was still drinking my water.

We had two appetizers and the small Round New York Cheese pizza.  My wife had the Eggplant Pizzettes, 3 breaded discs with ricotta and a very tasty marinara sauce.  I had the Tomato & Burrata, which is their version of Caprese salad.  Instead of sliced tomatoes, sliced mozzarella, and basil, this had a circle of quartered small tomatoes around a big ball of fresh mozzarella.  The plate was also seasoned with olive oil and basalmic.  The mozzarella was absolutely the freshest I've ever had, but our server told us that it was not made in the restaurant.  The pizza was excellent, great cheese, great sauce, great crust.  Next time we're back in Las Vegas, I want to try the Baked Ziti and Brooklyn Chicken.",1

WTF? I have no quibbles about the quality of the food, and if you stick to the regular menu, it's only moderately expensive, but it will be a long time before I drop my hard-earned money at Raku again.

So we spent $6 plus tip, chugged our Lite beers and ran away.",0
657,"Service was wonderful (it did help that I knew the vice-GM).  Atmosphere was contemporary with a focus on the kitchen area where you can watch all the makings of the food.  The bar-type setting was original and functional.

It's actually the best mashed potatoes I've ever had.  The beef was well seasoned and very juicy.\n\nLes Fromages - Blue cheese, Creamy sheep cheese and Camembert.  9/10:  I wish I could savor the cheeses fully, but I was already borderline full by the time I reached this dish.  I love cheese and L'Atelier was very close to representing a variety makes of cheese with only three types.\n\nSorbet Selection - 8/10:  By this time, I was was pass full, but I did try to savor each sorbet.  I believe there were at least 6 different types.  I remember one making my face wrinkle due to the level of tartness.  The company I came with had the traditional tarts, which were tasteful and also had a very acidulous tart.\n\nI would definately come back here when visiting Vegas.",1
658,"The salsa is really good. I liked mixing the tomatillo (medium) with the hot salsa on the chip. Gives it a smokey, sweet flavor.\nFor my entree I had the Pescado Verde.

660,"This is a 3.5 rounded to a 4!\n\nWe came here during Magic week in Las Vegas, so there were way more people at the restaurant than expected for a Tuesday night.  The hostess in the front was acting strangely and didn't recognize us when we came back in 15 minutes to see if our table was ready.  Our server inside was actually really sweet and helpful.  There was a little wait, but she was so pleasant it made up for any waiting we had to do.\n\nThe restaurant itself is really cool.  It's my favorite Cosmo restaurant interior.  I want that flooring in my house!!  I have yet to see the outdoor seating, but I bet it's very fun to eat with that view outside.\n\nMy favorite part of the meal was the Comme Ca Burger.  It is in my top 5 burgers in Vegas (Flemmings, Vitner Grill, Tommy Bahama, Del Taco, and now Comme Ca)... and yes I said Del Taco.  If you have never tried the double del cheeseburger, you have not lived.  But anyway, moving on, I have to give it to Comme Ca for cooking it perfectly to order.  The patty is really thick, I was surprised to see the whole burger medium throughout.  Many restaurants cannot do this!  I couldn't stop eating the fries either.\n\nI also had the roasted lamb.  I didn't enjoy it as much as the burger, and it was served with a charred eggplant sauce (never had tried this before).  It was good, but the lamb wasn't very flavorful.  The eggplant sauce wasn't kicking up the party for me either.  But then again, I am no food critic.  It might be a fantastic combo for someone else, I would actually love to hear what people have to say about this dish.\n\nIn the end, I would bring the guys here, even with a big group, and have the burger and some beers.  The restaurant is high energy, beautiful, great for groups.",1
661,"We had a party of 8. Unfortunately this place does not take reservations. We were told our wait would be an hour which is completely acceptable.

So another half hour passes and STILL no seats. So finally we tell them we will sit in separate areas and this got us instant seating. It would seem pushing two tables together wouldn't be all that hard, but who am I? \n\nAnyway, our waiter was a complete snob and was about as friendly as a wall. Let me also add that we were sitting CLEAR in the back of the restaurant while our friends were outside in the front. Our waiter was now serving BOTH tables. How does this make any sense? So back to our rude waiter...the place is obviously very clickish. The asian man who was the Main guy or whatever was at certain tables delivering food and just chatting them up and laughing and having fun while we didn't even get as much as a nod hello. \n\nThe waiter, who also had a table behind us talked up about the decadent meals and such. We were given a suggestion but not told how decadent anything was. Guess we don't go there enough and I mean why bother making someones first trip pleasant, right? I had pork belly and it was disgusting. Fatty, cold, and hardly a tapas size portion. My potatoes were cold as well. \n\nMaybe I was there on an off night, I don't know. In looking at these other reviews I would have to think maybe, but I won't be giving them another chance.",0

When i got there, I paid over 15$, which, I'm sorry is EXCESSIVE!   They need to sprinkle gold or something on there to make it worth the money at that price.  Either way, I paid since I did order it and figured if it was a really good pizza it was worth it.  Needless to say I was further disappointed when I got home and started eating it-now, I don't have extremely high standards when it comes to pizza-I love dominos, pizza hut, you name it-but the sauce was bland and had no taste to it. I lived in Boston for many years and have visited NYC many times; believe me when I tell you, this place has nothing, and I mean NOTHING in common with NY pizza.  I was disappointed and won't be back.",0

665,"Went for lunch. About $25 per person. They had everything. However, only thing i liked was the roasted pork, Portuguese sausage, and their gelato. The Asian section was so gross...everything was stuck together in their little steamers. Their chicken dumplings look like they've been there for so long they turned black. Their Shao Mai have been steamed too long or re-steamed too many times so the skin is falling apart.  Not worth $25. Overall, everything was probably reheated from their leftovers from the night before. Not going back.",0

Both steaks were cooked perfectly and had a seasoning that matched the meat well.\n\nWe dined late so we only waited about 10-15 minutes but if you want to visit during peak hours I advise making reservations.",1

The staff was amazing with him and made him feel so comfortable that he actually sat through an entire cleaning without being upset once. They had him put on sunglasses during the cleaning and he thought that was cool. They hygienist also told him about the sugar bugs living in his mouth and that he has to keep up brushing and flossing so the sugar bugs wont live in his mouth.\n\nThe dentist and the assistants were made to work with children and that made it all very relaxing and enjoyable for him.,1
671,"I met Molli this evening and was very happy to have met such a talented hair stylist and woman. I came into Mollie's studio after a hairstylist royally messed up my hair by adding 4 different shades of color; one which came out orange and one other that came out bleach blonde white (almost gray looking). Molli, was gracious enough to come into her studio which by the way.. is adorable, to help me correct my hair before the holidays. She took her time and was VERY personable and funny. I enjoyed being there and really liked my hair. Much better than before! If you are looking for an experienced and affordable stylist, she is your girl.",1
672,"I've been to Postino a countless number of times, and have never been disappointed by the food or the service.  The servers are always friendly and helpful, and the food (especially the small sandwiches and bruschetta) is delightful.\n\nIf you're thinking about going during happy hour or for dinner, I recommend calling ahead to make a reservation, or expect to wait.  It can get pretty packed.",1
673,"It's gourmet pizza people, they put it in the name of the restaurant.  If you don't like gourmet pizza, don't go to a place called \""""... Gourmet Pizza\""""\n\nWe've been to this location a few of times.  The pizza is great.  We've opted for their special pizzas each time.  But most memorable has been the baked brie and roasted garlic appetizer.  If you like garlic and you haven't had a whole roasted garlic you need to try one.  \n\nThe value for this place is ok it's not carry out after all.  The prices are about $15-$20 per adult at our table.  If I remember correctly our last visit was 4 adults and 2 toddlers.  One app + One large salad to share +a drink or two + a large pizza came out to 70 and we were well full.\n\nI also have to applaud a place for using their brains when applying policy.  They have a happy hour which is, by policy, for their small bar area at the high top tables.  We really wanted to sit at a table and watch a game on TV so they let us and ave us the happy hour prices there.  It seems like a no-brainer for an empty restaurant in this economy but the restaurant next door would not budge in the same situation, so kudos to Picazzo's staff for having basic business sense.",1
674,"Whoa.  Next time you see a $8.99 buffet, don't fall for it!  My friend and I sat eating for 20 minutes, pretending to enjoy, and finally we looked up at each other and knew we couldn't take it anymore.\n\n\""""Want to go to McDonald's?\""""  I did.  I really did.",0
675,"Umm, what did I just eat? 9:47 pm and I had a sweet tooth, it was way in the back lol. I had just taken my kids to Baskin Robbins a few days earlier but I didn't get anything that' time, my kids really loved it, but they're kids lol. Anyway I call them up to see what time they closed and to my surprise they were still open, close at 10 pm. I'm there in 5 minutes and decided on my favorite ice cream of all time, Butter Pecan. It was disgusting, extremely flavor LESS! I'm not sure if it was the ice cream or the cone but there's a burned taste in my mouth, never again will I go there, the employees were nice though...  My 2 scoop waffle cone was $4.56, not to expensive but I still want a refund.",0
676,"WORST eyebrow wax I have ever had. I believe the tech's name was Logan but left in shock. My eyebrows were completely off making my face look crooked.

677,Don't go here if you aren't Chinese...they will help everyone else first. We got there and they tried to sit the people behind us first until they said no they were here first. We sat for 10 minutes and watched them seat and serve 3 tables after us until we got up and walked out.,0
678,"Wife and I had dinner there and loved it. She had the veggie burger with salted potatoes. I had jackfruit(texture and body of oyster mushrooms) tacos, the best kale ever, and rosemary beans.

But for the time being I will say that the worst part is that I paid & furthermore splurged on this, my vacation...something I haven't done in years.  It also happened to be my bday & it was ruined by the unprofessisonal and imcompetance of the linq-i missed a bday dinner, a concert and worst of all-good times & memories...ultimately, all this was was money & time flushed down the drain. They didnt take accountability either & blammed hotels.com...i have photos/videos/& record from hotels.com as documentation to prove this to be true. \nThe one star I gave is for brooklyn bowl, otherwise if yelp allowed for it, i wouldn't give one at all.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe entire day I've called to request a blanket that every other room has on their bed. I spoke with someone more then 5x. Each time they either ignored or forgotten about my request OR are they are actually incompetant, which I'm starting to believe to be the reason.\n\nA pool is advertised, there is no pool. It is under construction. \n\nThe room service only operates from 7AM-1PM. \n\nElevators are for the most part broken & don't always run...best option is to use the stairs. \n\nMANAGMENT IS COMPLETELTY UNQUALIFIED TO OVERSEE A HOTEL & WITH THAT, A NEW HOTEL IN LAS VEGAS...ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR  DESTINATION SPOTS IN THE WORLD.

I had the Italian style wings which are marinated over night (from what they told me) and they were cooked to perfection.  This is my new place for football and fun.",1

683,"Went here for a bachelorette party of 12 girls, we had a reservation, waited 10 minutes to be seated, was seated a four different tables that we had to asked be pushed together.  We then sat at least 15 minutes before we were greater and our drink order was taken, but the drinks took almost 25 minutes before arriving.  When our drinks did arrive, the server ran off before taking our dinner order, more time passes... we order and our food comes out pretty reasonably ~15-20 minutes.  When the food did come out three orders were missing completely, our server did not bring our food and was nowhere to be found, we sat waiting until finally she came by.  At this point we've been here well over an hour.  The manager comes by, gets the food out, says that there would be a free round of drinks for the whole table.  I didn't receive the drink promised by the manager and when I asked the server I got a look, this was the first and only time I asked her about anything!?  She brought the drink as I was returning from the restroom and said that an entire bottle of wine would be brought out due to the issues, we explained that we had other commitments that it wasn't necessary.  Then the manager threw in two bottles of champagne, at this point, I'm pretty sure he knew that nobody had a great experience and was trying to save face.  \n\nIn the end, the manager was great at covering up for the lack of service we received but with so many options in downtown Charlotte I would chose another place next time.",0
684,"My husband I and just celebrated our wedding anniversary at Ruth's Chris and it was the best service we ever received.  I made a reservation one week in advance since I am not from the area.  The person who took our reservation asked me if I was celebrating a special occasion and I told her it was our anniversary.  To our surprise they actually used that information and had Happy Anniversary confetti spread out all over our table.  \n\nWe received our food quickly, steaks were tender and yummo.  The only little thing that was kind of annoying was that our cream of spinach came to us at room temperature.  Other than that everything else we ordered was on point!  \n\nOur server, PJ, was also friendly.  We ordered a pre-fixed menu, they didn't have our favorite dessert on the menu but he hooked us up with our favorite complimentary dessert.  Kudos to PJ!\n\nI don't know if it was a stroke of luck or if this is how they normally treat customers, but I'll be going back next time I visit Arizona.",1
685,"I will rarely take the time to complain about service, but this place is terrible. We sat for 10 or more minutes until we were acknowledged, not by our server, but a manager. Then maybe five minutes later (I am being fair here) a server brought our drinks  we ordered from the manager and almost walked away without taking our order. Furthermore, there was no apology for our 15 minute wait just to get our drinks. Mind you it wasn't even that busy. None of the servers smiled, the margaritas were not great and were mostly mix, and the food was way over priced. I got two tiny bland fish tacos for $12. If you're looking for good service and good Mexican food, I recommend going somewhere else. Otherwise, by all means don't say you weren't warned.",0
686,"After reading great reviews on yelp, I decided to take a cab trip here to get in some vintage shopping while on vacation. It was a $20 fare from the strip and I got here right at 11. Imagine my frustration as I stand here at 11:45 and the place never opened! There is no sign saying why, no notice on their Facebook page and no one answering their phone... not even a professional answering machine explaining store hours, etc. Needless to say I'm now waiting for my cab ride back to the strip. What a colossal waste of $40 in cab fare. Very disappointing!",0
687,"Looking at the price tag and other yelp reviews, I figure this place would be decent.  I went here because of my dining vouchers from a time share presentation.  First, when I made the reservation, they made it a big deal that I was dressed business casual. I show up and everyone is in shorts and t-shirts.  Second, there is a prix fixe menu and they didn't bother to show it to me (since it has the special discount early prices). Third, I had a reservation, but when we sat down, they told us there were no booths available.  After I sat down, we looked around the room and there were 6 booths with no one there. I saw the reservation book and there no other reservations.  Fourth, food was so so. All the sides were drowned in olive oil (mushrooms and potatoes).  Steak was so so. Go to ruth chris, much better. Fifth, we got our bill before we even got desert.  I expect that from mcdonalds, but a 4 dollar sign fancy restaurNt???  If I could, I would have tender owe me stars.  We did get two waiters and a bus boy. I waiter and bus boy were good... Other waiter sucked.  Only go to this place if you have free dining vouchers..and even if you did, ask for new vouchers and go elsewhere.",0
688,"An attempt at a pleasant Happy Hour was ruined by a barman who couldn't have had a worse attitude if he tried (maybe he was trying). We would like to love this place, it's new to the neighborhood. This will be our last visit, there are places in Phoenix that actually employ staff that are committed to facilitating a nice dining experience. Not Red Thai.",0
689,"The supreme breakfast burrito is the number one breakfast burro in chandler, a must try for all.  I am impressed with the meat portions in the taco/enchilada combos as well..the downers...they desperately need some spicy hot sauce.  I hope to see this place do well and stick around for a long time to come.  I would also like to see the owner be a little tougher on a few of his employees (dress code, on the phone while working, smoking out front, etc). Overall, great spot to fill the hunger void for less than $10.00..giant drinks as well.",1
690,"Honestly, I can't say enough about this place. First of all, the owner is incredibly rude. I've been here with my boyfriend and his father many times, and the owner will chat happily with the men at the table without so much as a peep to me. I hate to say this about some one but he's openly ignored me every single time he's come to the table. \nThe service is actually great from the waitresses. All of them! Kudos ladies!\nThe food is subpar, bland, and frozen. The portions are gigantic, which normally I love because I get seconds the next day, but even though I take food home every time, they're thrown away because I never have any interest or desire in eating this food again.\nAny time you feel like trying it, do yourself a favor and skip it.",0
691,"For the price of this buffet, it's awesome! $35! WHEE!\n\nIt's pretty freakin' cool that they have practically unlimited bone marrow!! The catch, though, is that the bone marrow is not the greatest tasting marrow of them all. It lacked seasoning, lacked some sort of bread to go with it, making it taste just fatty... I came here hoping to eat mostly bone marrow and be embarrassed by the amount of bone stacked on my plate, but alas, I only ate one.:( meow meow....\n\nWhat helped boost their rating is their angry mac and cheese! And it comes in a little cute pot as well. I probably could've eaten this the rest of the night, but I decided not to waste my $35 on amazing mac and cheese.  Next time I come though, I will get more than 1 serving.\n\nCrab legs are also available. I wish they had more variety of crab legs like the Wynn buffet offers, but the fact that they have it at all is still nice in my book.  \n\nOverall, I left happy and full.  The wait was a little over an hour, which I guess isn't horrible.  The staff could've been a bit more attentive, but it's a buffet so I didn't expect much.  Will definitely come back again!",1

693,"Depending on your style or clothing preference, this outlet may be or may not be for you.  If you're more in to the higher type class clothing I suggest you head out to the premium outlet near downtown vegas but if you're in to surfing brands, good kicks, and skinny jeans, this place is for you.\n\nLevis is always having great discounts on their jeans so before you go paying for it full priced at the near by Town Square, this place is just about 5 min drive away and if you want to save, why not check it out.\n\nQuicksilver, Hurley, Billabong, and even Oneil are all here, so duuude come on braaaah, check these places out for totally awesome sales duuude.  \n\nNow for the kicks....Nike, Adidas, Converse and other great brand names are here too.  Im not really knowledgeable when it comes to how much these shoes should be compared to whats out there because all I buy are chucks so I can't really tell you whether the deals here are great or not.  \n\nThis place isn't as nice or as big as the Premium but its really close to where I live and has all the stores I prefer and this is the reason for my 4 star.",1
694,"I've been dying to try this place hoping to recapture the fond memories of eating mouth watering lechon from Cebu and the famous steamed rice with pork and shrimp topping from Ding Hao. So last night I was in a spur of the moment mood and called to place an order to go. When I got there at 6 pm the place was totally empty, I thought uh oh I hope that's not an indication of inferior tasting food. Lechon, albeit the skin was crispy, the taste just wasn't there or I should say it's NOT what a normal lechon from Cebu tastes like. It needed more spices and I didn't detect the smell and taste of lemongrass which I think is a huge part of the flavor. The pork steamed rice wasn't good at all. It was too sweet and the texture was off. I really wanted to like this place so I'm very disappointed, but who knows maybe one day I might just try their other offerings.",0
695,"I was visiting Montreal over the weekend and was told that I needed to try this place. It was a great recommendation and I fully agree with that advice. If you're going to Montreal you should definitely make time to eat at Schwartz's.\n\nI will warn you that the line was very long, however, it was worth the wait!\n\nNo need to look at the menu here you NEED to get the Smoked Meat. Their special is the smoked meat sandwich, fries and a cherry cola. I switched the cola to normal coke with my order and was in heaven.\n\nGiving Schwartz's a 5 star rating is a no brainer. This place is awesome!",1
696,"Went to a friend's birthday gathering at Firefly's new location on Paradise. Disappointed. Best example was the potatoes brava. They were slimy with a spicy but otherwise flavorless sauce and globs of what seemed like mayo from a jar. A feint shadow of the fabulous potatoes brava at Julian Serrano, which have a gourmet tomato-based sauce and light creamy aioli.\n\nThe service was also frustrating. We were in a booth with about eight people. The curtains blocked people on the ends of the table from sight, which meant waiters never bothered to ask us if we wanted anything else. We had to get up from the table and seek out the waiter several times.\n\nThis is huge place and in terms of quality this is like the chain restaurant of tapas places. For a little bit more Julian Serrano, in Aria, is orders of magnitude better.",0
697,"The food was excellent.  I appreciate that, even though we ordered our beef cooked differently, the chef worked the grill to cook the well done meat in a hotter part of the grill so that everyone was still served together. Very nice. We had the Filet Mignon and didn't order any sushi. I wouldn't have had room anyway.  I strongly suggest paying the small price to add fried rice. It was delicious. We also had a nice conversation with the chef. He didn't stay locked into the flipping shrimp show, but showed enough that we knew it was there for the asking.  Only complaint - wait until we're done to bring out the mop bucket.  We'll be back though. The price was better than most Teppanyaki places and the food didn't disappoint.",1
698,"No one has mentioned the fact that you need to be a bat to walk into this place...very overrated.  Wait staff handed out flashlights to read menu.  Seriously!  Oh, and the plates need to e that HOT!  Truly overlooked our steaks before we could enjoy.",0
699,"Our food was decent but the service was horrible. Our server was rude, hurried our meal, and gave us a dish we had canceled (and subsequently also charged us for his mistake). We enjoyed our food and had a mediocre bottle of wine, but did not like eating in the pitch black; we probably wouldn't go back based on the poor lighting and poor service.",0
700,"I'm not the clubbing type of girl, but this club definitely blew me away. Thanks to my girlfriend, I was able to bypass the atrocious line that had already formed by 9 PM and be the first to step into the nightclub. Some of my other friends arrived at 8 PM and were first in line. I felt really bad for the boys in my group, though. They knew I hadn't gone clubbing in Vegas prior to this, so they forked over $50 cover each to accompany me and the girls (although I hear cover is only $30 during off season).\n\nI can't believe how beautifully decorated it is. The pool, cabanas, daybeds, and gogo dancers are absolutely amazing! Drinks are overpriced, of course. 5 shots of patron for $60. The venue didn't seem THAT huge, but my group of 20 somehow got separated an hour after we entered the club, and we weren't able to find each other for the rest of the night. The club was PACKED (I hear this is where everybody wants to be on a Saturday night).\n\nLamar Odom and Khloe Kardashian were there the same night, along with some other NBA players I didn't recognize. Definitely a good first Vegas clubbing experience =)",1
701,"Well first of all it is a great place to be good music and decent drink prices.

704,"I don't even know where to begin. Archi's has never failed me before, but this was my first time at this location. My family took Dan T. and I here for a Sunday afternoon lunch. My parents were ignored when they first walked in so two of the hostess could chatter among themselves. (we weren't the only ones waiting either!) after a few minutes of going back and forth and laughing they finally got around to seating people. (btw there were also empty tables so we knew it wasn't a full house to be waiting either.) After seated we ordered our drinks from a not so friendly waitress who looked like she was still in high school. (hopefully she is there learning some manners.) i didn't catch her name but she did have a birthmark on the side of her face/chin. After about 15 minutes of waiting to put in our order she finally came by our table again. We ordered and she watched my mom finish off her water. Now instead of bringing out a new one my mother had to wait to spot her down again about 5 minutes later to ask for a refill. We waited and waited what felt like forever for our food. Did they forget about us? Nobody came to check on us for refills again and just seemed to snub their noses up at us. weird. Good thing we all can make good conversation with each other. After waiting about a good 35-40 minutes for our food it was finally in front of us. I ordered the pad see ew with beef. Now, I have liked archi's better than pin kaow since they always serve more broccoli in theirs. It was okay. Not as I remember. Maybe I was just upset over our attitude waitress and that ruined it for me. Whatever it was I was just turned off. After we were finished with our food our waitress had disappeared and we had to ask a guy for a few boxes. Mind you we had 4 large plates and a bowl of rice. Some plates still half full of food. After he looked at the table he brought back 2 of the smallest to-go boxes I have seen. How were we suppose to fit our food in there? We tried ordering some mochi ice cream, but he seemed like he wanted nothing to do with us. annoyed that he had to help us. uh, sorry but have you seen our waitress because we haven't for quite some time? finally after we split some mochi the waitress came over with our check and took our food to the back to put it to boxes for us after we asked.\nI am so annoyed with this experience even a few days later. I don't think I will be back here. Not even to order to-go. (which i couldn't even find a to-go menu and even trying to ask for one was a hassle.) Archi's you really let me down this past Sunday. I hope your manager reads this and puts you into place. I don't expect top-notch service and someone always at my table, but I do expect a smile and atleast a little service when dining out.",0
705,"I wish I could like this place more. The decor basically screams \""""Austin Powers!\"""" redux, the Beatles are my favorite band, and the entrance which is basically a wall spelling out \""""REVOLUTION\"""" that you enter through the spaces between the letters is really cool. Unfortunately the music here is at best hit and miss: There's really nothing to set it apart from any other club/lounge when they spin the same techno/house as every other place on the Strip and if you can't do that any better (and actually a lot worse) than you competitors then you should at least commit to the Beatles theme fully and play some of their classics. The bartenders all look like they're miserable behind the bar but at least the waitresses serving the tables try to look like they don't hate being there. The drinks are rather standard price for a lounge (13-14 for a scotch) and the table service is really cheap but this isn't the type of place you would want to spend too much time. Promoters in the Mirage give out all sorts of promotions: guys can usually get free entry before 11/12 and girls get open bar for a few hours, but as you'd expect it's all well drinks. The crowd is mainly 30 somethings and no one is particularly well dressed but you'll probably run into a few conventioneers rocking the 3 piece suit and standing uncomfortably by the bar. \n\nOn the plus side, they usually have the Go-Go dancers who aren't dancing at the moment handing out free shots on the dance-floor. I don't know what was in those (they looked purple and tasted a bit like blueberries) but I know that after my friend downed 4 of them and a few vodka tonics he was compelled to inform the girl handing them out that \""""she was the most beautiful person\"""" he had ever seen.",0
706,"The yogurt is decent.  However, I found the place to be slightly misleading.  \n\nIf you have been here, you know that this is a self serve yogurt bar.  You get your cup at the beginning and proceed to fill it with whatever frozen yogurt and whatever additional toppings you want. \n\nAt the start of the line there are two cups.  They are labeled 'Small' and 'Large'.  I picked the small cup thinking it would be cheaper.  Little did I know that at the end of the line you have to pay by the weight!  Why would you have two different size cups if you have to pay by weight at the end of it?  Needless to say when i checked out I paid a whopping $13 for two cups of frozen yogurt!  They should mention this somewhere!  Not surprise their customers at the end of the line after they have already picked everything they want!",0
707,"If you live close by & money is not the issue, The place is quiet; simple decoration, good for lunch meet with friends. \n\nI ordered Shrimp noodle soup. Only two things in clear soup. shrimp & noodle, that's it.\n Bean Sprout & Basil was on the side, it was for you to put in boiling hot soup right before you eat, but the soup came out luke warm.\n\nThis $9 Shrimp noodle soup dish is too bland to serve in restaurant.\nI can think of many other restaurant to spend this amount & get very tasty dish.",0
708,"This place looked very promising from the menu and the decor.  I typically enjoy any Fox restaurant, however, this restaurant is a gimmick.  \n\nI ordered the free range half chicken.  I really enjoy this dish at most restaurants, but I was disappointed.  The chicken seemed to be low quality, and was very fatty.  The iced tea was good though.\n\nIf you are vegan or have a food allergy, this restaurant will be great for you.  However, otherwise, you are paying for food that may have a gluten-free, vegetarian, or vegan label that lacks flavor.  If you are looking for this option, then try it, but otherwise, I would find a restaurant that offers a smaller selection of these dishes at a lower price.    \n\nJust mediocre.  And way overpriced.",0
709,"Service here was a total nightmare.  I'm pretty sure management is comprised of a herd of cats because everything was chaos.\n\nAlthough I was seated at a table, and had food brought to me, I still have no idea who my server was.  There was a guy with an iPhone that took our order...but mysteriously disappeared.  Then the bartender ended up taking our order after we had to ask for our order to be taken.  Just, service misery. Keep dreamin' if you want water refilled.  The whole meal was spent tracking down employees to perform basic tasks. \n\nFood was okay (blue crab, lobster roll, nothing special) and the restaurant was clean -- the only things saving this place from 1 star.  Not worth it, however, to endure round 2 of this service mess.",0
710,"Wow! Words alone will not be able to explain the depth of deliciousness that encompassed this meal. Rather than try I'll state simply that you must eat here. Perfect!! We had a party of 8 and enjoyed a variety of items such as: carpaccio, linguine with clams, lamb osso bucco, veal piccata, chicken parm, and much more. A great variety (no two people ordered the same dish). Celebrated a birthday and they took great care of us at Trevi. Thanks!",1
711,"Bottom line: Dirty\n\nOur table was filthy.  I couldn't put my napkin down on the table because there was a layer of dirt on it.  Seriously, how hard is it to wipe down a table?  We ordered and appetizer and a couple of drinks.  Our food, Irish version of potato skins, was average but too expensive for the small portion.  Then we found one of the waitresses hairs in our drink.  When we pointed it out her response was, \""""Oh seriously? Haha.\"""" And she still charged us for the drink.  I would rather go grab a cheap pizza or hot dog on Fremont street rather than ever coming here again.",0

713,"I was really looking forward to visiting this restaurant. \nI chose breakfast because it's the only time they have BEIGNETS:D \nHaving said that, I was more than a little disappointed with the service. \n\nI called an hour before I planned on being there, 9 am on Sunday, to ask if it was necessary to have a reservation. The answer was \""""ALWAYS\""""... I thought maybe I heard wrong or he misunderstood, because it sounded a bit rude, lol. I made my reservation & arrived to find the place nearly empty. I told them I had a reservation & I was simply told very curtly to \""""sit at any table for 2\"""", so I did as told:) I ordered a coffee & beignets, because that's what I came for & chatted with my companion while eating them. About 10 the waiter came by & asked if there was anything else he could do for us as he cleared everything out from under our noses,,,,, believe me when I that everything about him was saying \""""get out if you're not going to order anything else\"""". We laughed it off & went on our merry little way. I figured he was having an off day, happens to everyone, until I read some of the other reviews & it sounds like he may be having a bad year,,, that happens too! \n\nI plan on going back for dinner. I'm hoping it is so delicious that it makes the service of no consequence:)\nIf I strike out the second time, there will be no going back!",0

715,"First thing I have to say about this restaurant is that I have had the BEST French Onion Soup I have ever had. Having tasted many soups from posh dining to fast food, it is extremely difficult to use the right amount of spice without making this starter very salty. They perfected this delicious soup and I would travel the 6 hours to Montreal just to get my hands on this delight again. \n\nBut enough about the soup...\nThe staff was very eager to receive us even though we were dressed in jeans and t-shirts, we were just trying to grab a bite of some fine french cuisine after a long day of site seeing. The restaurant was not crowded one bit and they were able to sit us immediately. Their wine list was quite extensive though if I remember correctly, there was not one bottle under $85. \nI am always interested in dessert wines before a meal (I know Im a bit non-traditional) so I had asked if they had any Italian Moscatos. The waitress was unfamiliar with this wine but pleasantly came back to us after checking with her manager and suggested a similar wine. Though we rejected her selection (it was a half glass for $17), we decided to try a dessert chardonay which ended up being close to what we were looking for anyways.\n\nFor my main course, I chose their Beef Wellington. *drooooool*\nSavory medium cooked beef completely breaded with an onion gravy... it was exactly what I had hoped for after a long day of touristing. They serve their entrees with an assortment of cooked vegetables ranging from stuffed tomatos, some kind of fried zucchini, a breaded mash potato ball, asparagus, and a colorful pink edible flower to garnish. I was pleasantly suprised by the variety of vegetables that were all prepared so differently. You could tell their chef really took the time to impress his audience. \n\nI also wanted to point out one interesting little detail that I thought was fabulous. This is a fine dining retaurant which usually never appeals to children, however, there was a family sitting behind us with 2 kids, and they revealed a special menu just for children. I didnt actually see what was on their menu but I felt that this was a really great idea so that moms and dads can enjoy their quality cuisine and still be able to feed the kids without the kicking and screaming.  Bravo!\n\nI would recommend this place again and again.",1
716,"I went to see Deana way back in November, but after reading some of the comments about the length of time of her appointments I wanted to finally share my experience. I had planned on writing a review for months, but it slipped my mind until now. When I went to see Deana I brought in about 10 pictures of celebrities who I look nothing alike. I went in feeling kind of embarrassed because I've brought photos in to other stylists before and had them laugh at my expectations. Deana was the exact opposite! She was able to go through the photos and explain to me which ones she felt would work better than others, and why, and then together we decided which one to go off of. I decided to go ombre with balyage highlights and she did an AMAZING job! She used 2 different levels of lightener and 3 or 4 shades of brown so there are no harsh lines at all and it both gradually and noticeably gets lighter going down the strands, which is exactly what I wanted.  So yes, it took a long time, about 4 hours, but I am still getting tons of compliments on my hair! It's almost unfortunate that she did such a great job, because it's April and I still haven't been back because as my hair grows out it looks even better. She also gave me an amazing cut, she took awhile doing it and I was a little nervous that she may have been cutting too much since, but she cut off exactly what we had decided and was just being thorough. In addition, she educated me more about how to bring my hair back to a healthier state, and after following what she said (which was very simple) my hair looks phenomenal, even if I just let it air dry, which it never did before I saw her. I would HIGHLY recommend taking the time to go see Deana, the countless 5 star reviews say it all!",1
717,"Very good fresh food. Little expensive as expected from a place serving healthy fresh food and also vegan options. There was a long wait. We went on a Sunday morning.

718,"Going to this place reminded me why I don't go to these places.\n\nThey should change the name of this place to Riff Raff n' Nausea; you get to be around all the rudest, most obnoxious people of S.

719,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\n\nI went there a second time because I couldn't remember if I liked the food or not (yes,it was THAT unremarkable). Upon going there the second time, I knew there would not be a third. Ever. \n\nI know this is Madison, but c'mon, I've had more authentic Chinese food at Panda Express. What should have been an immediate tip-off was the fact that there weren't any chinese words on the menu...and that all the clientele was white (again, yes I know this is Madison, but this is compared to other Chinese restaurants like Fugu or Ichiban). I don't actually remember the specific dishes I ordered (I've had fish, chicken, pork, and beef there), but it all just tasted as if it had been sitting in the freezer for months. Dry and flavorless. \n\nThe service was also slow. They refilled our glasses only once, after we had asked for the check.\n\nI won't be going back.",0
720,Food was excellent! We had Crispy Artichoke Hearts and asparagus fries for appetizer. Both were great but especially loved the artichoke hearts. Next we had Caesar salad which needed some more cheese or salt but still tasted pretty good. I had prime rib and my husband had sirloin steak both came with mashed potatoes and green beans. They were both very good. I probably would choose grilled sirloin steak between two. For dessert my husband had warm peach cobbler and I had chocolate lava cake. So good. Hot bread they brought was also very tasty. Our experience were overall great. Our waiter Mark was nice and kept coming back and checking on us. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant.,1

723,"I'm giving this branch four stars for a couple reasons. First its very close to my house. Second I'm on a first name basis with the clerks & a few of the supervisors so it has a homey feel to me. It can have very quick service or you can get a clerk that's so slow that you want to claw your eyes out with a fork. Sometimes though its the customers that make you wonder if maybe there's a full moon out there.\n\nThe branch has mailbox services, 2 automated postal centers, a satellite counter that may or may not be open & a long main counter that can have up to three clerks.This branch also has a passport office but most folks never find out where it is until they've stood in line for half an hour.\n\nThe passport office is located on the back side of the building. You have to drive around the right side of the building past Char 7 Bar till you come to a chain link fence. The office will be the door closest to the fence. It really helps speed up the passport process if you have the form already filled out. The clerk will walk you through every line on the form so be prepared to be there for awhile. There is often a line as well. The office also does not have the same hours as the branch it is attached to so you may need to ask a clerk before heading back.",1

727,"No thank you. This was the worst service that we've ever received.\n\nDO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL!\n\nI REPEAT...\n\nDO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL!!\n\nTHIS IS A HORROR STORY!\n\nWe contacted them about a promotion that we received in the mail. We booked two double-bed rooms over the phone. We were really excited about staying at this new hotel. We had heard that it was beautiful and lively. They gave us great customer service when we called. It sounded so awesome that even my brother and his family wanted to go! They asked if I can call and book one more room.\n\nSo I called and asked to try and see if we can book one more double-bed room. They said they were more than happy to book one more double-bed room! We just had to pay an extra 30$. Great. \""""Will the rooms be close to each other?\"""" No because the other two rooms are single-bed rooms. Hmmm...that's not what we booked and what the sales girl told me. So they told me that I had to pay an extra 30$ per room for the double bed. Fine. I'll pay it but I am not happy that I was misled to begin with. I want to talk to the girl who gave me the wrong information or her supervisor to file a complaint. If I hadn't called back and added the additional room I would have showed up with 8 adults and 1 infant with two beds only?\n\nWell, nobody ever called me back. Whatever. And I showed up with three parties. But we were informed that...we all had single bed-rooms?\n\nAll double bed-rooms in the hotel are booked. On December 28th? Tuesday? Really?\n\nNow I'm pissed.\n\nI want to raise hell! I want to talk to the manager! I want to talk to the salesperson who signed us up for the room. I want someone to make this right! I want double-beds so we don't have to sleep on the floor. The supervisor in-charge told us to sleep in our room that night and tomorrow they would contact us when rooms opened up.\n\nWell, as you could have guessed that never happened...\n\nI had over 15 people at that hotel! We slept there, ate there, and bathed there. We gambled there. We spent a lot of money there. And all I wanted was for someone to keep their promise and follow through.

I said it conversationally and added that they're 50 cents at Deseret Industries.

I have spent upwards of $15 for vintage patterns that I love but there is no reason to spend $2 on dirty, already cut (possibly pieces missing) patterns that are currently available at half the price brand new.

746,"Typical comedy club with a 2 drink minimum. They pack a full house and put on great shows. I saw Anjelah Johnson and Mal Hall. \n\nWe had reserved seating as we accompanied family members. No seats are really better than others unless you are seated at the foot of the stage.\n\nSimilar to another review I had a server spill steak sauce all over my leg and arm. There was no apology or even recognition of their mistake. I didn't expect anything just disappointed there wasn't any acknowledgment.\n\nAfter the show I had a chance to go back stage for photos, small talk, and good times. The greenroom is quite small about 20x20 is all. \n\nA little tip is to arrive early and enjoy some drinks next door at the bar instead of exceeding your 2 drink minimum. Drink prices are a little over priced but the appetizers are worth the money! Got to try the Nachos!\n\nGreat times, enjoy the show!",1

Estrella got me a rush appointment within 20 minutes of my initial call, took kitty in right away and carefully performed X-rays and blood tests.

Once again I found them to be caring and responsive, and I will keep going back.",1
748,The best way to experience Vegas is with the jackify experience. I've done two invasion tours both during EDC week and if you know anything about EDC week in Vegas it's a mad house and a 100 dollar minimum to get in anywhere.

749,"I love Crescent - it's one of my resident third places.  They get great headliners and put on a wonderful two-day music festival for Dias de la Crescent in the summer (I sincerely hope this becomes a standing music festival in the Valley.)  I went to the Halloween Ball and New Year's Eve party where there was free cover and some terrific DJs.  The staff is terrific - the bouncers do a great job with crowd control and you can always get a bartenders attention.  Bathrooms are always clean and the lines usually move pretty quickly.  Drinks are reasonably priced ($4 g&ts) and they make some wonderful house creations such as the \""""Honeybadger.\""""  Also, it attracts a great blend of people. You can wear just about anything and fit in. \n\nI have so many fond memories of this place and will continue to frequent it.  Crescent Ballroom is one of the coolest venues in Phoenix!",1

They are closing down to expand their resturant!!! So they told me they wont be opening up again in a month or two!,1

752,"Adopted a dog a little over a week ago and couldn't have had a better experience. I had hoped to find a dog here as I know the ones that don't find a forever family won't make it out alive. It's unfortunate that the shelter gets a bad reputation for being a kill shelter. It is not their fault that there are so many irresponsible owners and backyard breeders here in Vegas. We adopted the most amazing little dog! The staff was friendly and knowledgable. They explained all paperwork and known history of the dog as best they could. The cost to adopt probably hardly covers the costs of boarding these animals...food, shots, spay/neuter, etc. you also get a free wellness exam from a local VCA animal hospital if you schedule the appointment within five days of adopting. I hope people choose adoption...save a life!!",1

She then came back got me started put foils on which I think she wasn't going to do bec my hair was already light. I show her a picture and ask her if thats how it was going to look a few times and she keep telling me yes. Long story short after3hrs or so she remove the foils and wash my hair put some treatment on it and left me there(for another 30-45mins). I got tired of waiting for her and wash my hair and I also blow dry my own hair bec she was busy with 2 other ladies. My hair was horrible YELLOW AND FRY so burn, uneven tones of yellow/orange/black and red when all I wanted was a caramel ombre. I was so mad but I still just pay her after 6+hrs all I wanted was to go home so I had no energy for arguing. I did told her I didn't like it and that it was too yellow she just said it looks pretty and continue on checking me out. I do not recomment Rachel or the location on 16th st at all. I when the next day with the intention of looking for the owner so I when to the other location on 15th ave and Camelback Lorraine was awesome she immediatley address me and apologize, did a color correction. She fix my hair it look exactly how I wanted. She was really nice/caring and ask what I wanted and not wanted. She was also super fast and did my hair in about 2hrs or less.

757,"I have been shopping here for 25 years but no more - because of the incident there today. I bought what was labeled as tempera paint (and the label clearly states it washes off with soap and water) for a sidewalk/street painting project for a Festival and the product is clearly misrepresented.  I scrubbed for two hours with a push broom and soapy water to try to remove the so called tempera paint with absolutely no success with a couple of the colors - and partial success with a couple of others.  The Streets and Transportation Dept. finally had to come paint over it.  When I tried to take the paint back with my complaint I was basically told that oh, this is a high quality tempera paint that is made to last.  So why does the label say it washes off with soapy water?  They tried to imply it would not come off because of the unusual surface, but then went on to say it is meant to stick to anything and stay there because it is high quality tempera.  I asked what the difference was then between the tempera they are selling and acrylic paint and could get no good answer (oh, we can call the manufacturer and ask what is in it!).  I have always been a bit irked by their so called discounts for Artlink members, when in reality whenever you ask for a discount you are invariably told the item is already on sale, therefore not eligible for a discount.  From now on I will be taking my business to Jerry's Artarama, even though it is all the way over in Tempe.",0
758,"We have been Stein Club members for years and have had really positive experiences in the past with Gordon Biersch.  We have attended Stein Club and Passport parties as well as classes with Brewmaster Lovelady.  We loved all that.  Unfortunately, all good things apparently must come to an end.  We have noticed a decline in the quality of service, food and beer over the past year or so.  We have visited less and less because of it.  Tonight may be the last night we ever go there.  The food was terrible.  We had appetizers which were featured.  The fried onion stack tasted worse than fried onions in a can.. like they were triple dropped in the fryer.  There was no onion in there at all as far as I could tell...  the filet mignon sliders were supposed to be 2 ounces... well if they were a half an ounce that is generous.  They were tasteless and smelled like old beef.  The brats were tasteless.  The pretzel roll was probably the best thing we ate... and that's not saying much.  Even the mustard was tasteless and old tasting.  We have always loved the beer but this evening, even the beer was bad.  The Maibock was flat and tasted turned.  The Pilsner was underwhelming and also flat... far beneath our prior experience.  Happy Hour prices for beer went up and no one informed us of that.  We complained to the manager who pretended to care and do something or another on the register but when it came time to pay the bill... which took forever to get.... nothing had been done to compensate us for the terrible service, terrible beer and terrible food.  It was abysmal in every possible way.  We have always been good customers and good tippers.  They have lost good customers tonight.  If this was the first time, we might have ignored one bad experience but, this has been a long time coming over the past year or so.  Sorry.  No more.  Or No Mas.",0
759,"This is probably the nicest BL store in the valley. First of all, my husband and I really like this shopping center, period (seriously could spend hours here). We went here a couple weekends ago, \""""to browse\"""". You know what that means, you end up shopping, haha.\n\nThis store has probably the largest selection of furniture. I spotted two pieces that I really like, by Ashley Furniture (yes, that big name brand that you're familiar with)- both pieces were $250 each, not bad for a chaise lounge and a recliner. It was fun testing them all out. It's nice to see that there is more than just microfiber furniture available (we can't have that, ever- one of my dog's hair would be all over it, in like ten minutes). About 1/4 of the store is dedicated to furniture alone.  \n\nEverything is organized very well. The aisles are in order (you know, how annoying it is when the merchandise is all over the floor scattered- not like that here). It is very CLEAN here (I don't know why some stores are in horrible condition). This is probably my favorite from the chain of discount stores. \n\nI found a greeting card, two assortments of stickers, and a bag of guacamole chips, for $7. This is why I like these stores- bargains galore.",1

We received water shortly after we sat, then waited 10-15 minutes for a server to come to the table and only after we flagged her down. We were hungry and ordered a bottle of wine, salads and main course all at the same time. It took about 30 minutes to get the wine and 40 minutes for the salads (despite multiple requests for a status on our salads). We asked to speak to a manager, and that took another 10-15 minutes. When he did stop by our table, he asked if he could pour some more wine (no thank you, we were pouring our own and were fine), then he walked away. Completely disinterested. Our main courses came about 10 minutes later. Two of us ordered the flat iron steak - one ordered medium and the other medium well. Both came on the \""""well\"""" side of medium well. Another in our party had the pork special, which was very good. The chicken ordered by our fourth was unremarkable. If I were rating this solely on service alone, it would barely be one star. The rating at two stars is for a nice location and decent (but unremarkable) food.\nI will not be back.",0

767,"We have been taking our Yorkie to Caspers for many years.  The owner always seemed kind until today.  My husband picked her up after an unusually long time to find a shoulder puncture wound and a large, full thickness open wound to her front leg.  The owner lacked compassion and remorse for what had happened.  I have never seen such cruelty first hand and her lack of caring not just about my 16 year old dog but about her reputation as a groomer speaks volumes.  I had a $100.00 vet bill not to mention the suffering of my little dog after going to Caspers pet grooming.  The vet said they haven't seen a grooming injury this bad.  My little dog has 5 staples to her leg and dermabond to mend the shoulder laceration.  It's really sad for our family, especially out little kids to see and cannot understand such cruelty.  I would not recommend this groomer.  She never even said she felt bad. Now I know why this visit took so long, she had to wait for the bleeding to stop before she called us to pick her up.

I will say that the love is so real that I do not plan to ever stay anywhere else. This hotel is in such a convenient location that you will never have to take an Uber any where! We were walking distance by the big mall (that I never made it to) and from all the nightlife (which of course I made it to!). As read in the other reviews, this is NOT the place for kids and families to go to and it is loud with music from all the clubs surounding this place. If you are a light sleeper, good luck! The rooms are pricey but well worth it!\n\nPROS: \n-Cabanas are super reasonable price! On a saturday I got a day bed cabana which consisted of two day beds under a canopy right by the pool and it was only $100. Perfect for just me and my girlfriend!\n-Drinks and food were great! So great that all weekend, we ate at the hotel!\n-The people that work here are so friendly and so beautiful\n-Pool was perfect for lounging and never over crowded\n-DJ at the pool on weekends was awesome! \n-The hotel offers late check out for a small additional fee. We were able to check out at 6:00pm which was perfect because that is the time we needed to leave for the airport.\n-To use the elevators you need your room key which I love to keep the creepsters out.\n-The rooms were amazing and the bed was soooo comfortable!\n\nCONS:\n-During the DJ/Party times at the pool, we weren't allowed to take a nap in our paid cabana. The workers will actually tell you no sleeping. Strange! What if I wasn't sleeping and just resting my eyes! \n-Not sure when the pool closes but I do wish it was open for a relaxing night swim. Went Sunday night for a night swim and it was closed\n\nAs you can tell, there were many Pros and not many Cons! Successful hotel!\n\nP.S. Stayed for 3 whole days and ONLY left the hotel once!

771,"Terrible, terrible customer service. Me and my boyfriend were in there a couple of days ago, since I needed a new fix spray. I currently use Benefit spray, which is awesome but I also wanted to see if I could get a cheaper brand. Well, we weren't greeted when we walked in, but then again it was pretty busy, so I let that slide. But as I was looking around, trying to find where their fix sprays were, one associate walked right by me, (maybe like a foot away from me) and didn't ask if I needed help, and pretended like she was busy with a basket of items in her hand. Not wanting to bother her, I looked around for other help, but no one except the girls at the hair section seemed available. We wander around aimlessly for about 20 minutes, until  my boyfriend  found an associate who was standing in the front middle section of the store, writing something on a piece of paper. As I walked up to her, I asked her, \""""Excuse me?\"""" and in the rudest tone ever and without looking up, she says, \""""YES?\"""" I was shocked by her rudeness, but I went ahead and asked her for help anyway. She then looks up at me with the most irritated look on her face and says something along the lines of, \""""I'm not on the clock right now so I'm gonna have to get someone else to help you.\"""" She then yells loudly across the whole store to this young man and told him to show us the Urban Decay brand of fix sprays. Though this guy was nice, I wasn't too happy when I asked him if there was another brand of spray that is a bit cheaper and he says, \""""Oh, we don't carry any other brand, this is the only one we have. Plus, it's the best one we have and I wouldn't recommend anything else.\"""" After I thanked him and he left, I saw the Benefit product section, went over and saw that they had a bottle of fix spray that was cheaper than Urban Decay. I was irritated that he said they didn't carry anything else when clearly they did and was costing less. Seeing as how my temper was getting bad and I didn't want to stay in the store any longer, I got in line, purchased my spray and left. I have never left a business as angry and offended as I was here. And as for the rude associate who \""""helped\"""" us, I did not get her name but I think she was a manager of some sort. I would not advise anyone to shop at this location unless you want to be met with short, unprofessional and snappy behavior and amateur employees.\n\nEDIT: Actually, the Benefit product I mentioned is a facial re-hydrating mist, but can also double as a fix spray. Nevertheless, I believe the male associate should have shown me other options instead of telling me that Urban Decay was their only brand.",0

775,"Since nothing at ASU is really free anymore, at least having a free bus system (which won't be free anymore) is nice to take advantage of. Especially in the summer.  unfortunately the orbit, formally known as the neighborhood flash, doesn't quite make the free part worth it.  Sure  its nice that it goes to the little areas that you would usually have to walk to, but since it's free anyone can get on.  If you get a good bus driver he'll probably go the speed limit and stop at the actual orbit stop. Some bus drivers open the doors before they stop as if saying 'tuck and roll'.  I am not trying to get rid of the free service so soon, but if paying a little bit for better service and safety is what it takes...so be it!

780,"I wanted to write a review for this shop because I had a really great experience at this one. \nMy boyfriend and I were in Vegas for a weekend trip and we had run out of vape juice. On our way home we looked for the closest vape shop to buy juice for the drive. We really just walked in on a whim with an idea of the juice we wanted and every intention to make a quick fast exit. \nWhen we asked for Riptide Pink Spot juice, they had just sold out of the 6 nicotine bottle; however the friendly owners told us they'd do us one better and make us their own blend of riptide with their own ingredients. We were intrigued, but had to get on the road fast so we told them that we might not have the time. The man told us he'd whip it up for us in two minutes. As he went in back to create the final product, I asked the lady about their store brand juice. She informed me that they use a less balanced percentage of PG and VG (typically its 50/50) but that it makes for a better cloud. She also told me that they use no extra fillers and their juice is simple and pure, flavoring, nicotine and pg and vg. She was really friendly and I didn't feel like she was trying to sell me on her product, she just seemed to be really confidant that theirs was really good and stood out above the rest. She also gave us a great deal on some extra pink spot flavors. The man returned with a glass bottle and their \""""I Heart Vape\"""" logo on the bottle. We made small conversation as they rung us up, and they were really nice people. \n\nWe got in the car and dripped this homemade juice into our vape, and surprise! it was awesome! It was even BETTER than Pink Spot's rip tide and made a really big cloud. I was super impressed! Just to be sure I wasn't imagining this, I dripped some Pink Spot into the vape after it needed to be refilled, and could defintly tell the difference between the two. The I Heart Vape juice tasted much cleaner, less chemically, and was all around delicious. \n\nI don't typically write reviews for Vape shops, but I was so impressed by this one. I hope we can get some I Heart Vape Juice in California shops soon! All the best of success to your shop!",1

783,I was very excited to try a different restaurant for my Birthday but the experience was terrible.  It took 45 minutes to get sat they don't take reservations unless its 20 or more.  literally we sat there for over 10 minutes before our server even spoke to us.  He asked who wanted wine... and was about to walk away...not even going to ask if anyone at the table wanted a different drink.  He said he was going to bring bread sticks and we finally got them about an hour after being there.  Don't get me wrong the food was great but having to go thru all the crap to get good food is totally not worth it.  The server wouldn't split our check therefore making it tough to figure out how to pay.  The hostess said parties over 8 are no split checks but we only had 6 so what happened???    All in all you might want to try another restaurant in the casino or a different Italian restaurant if that's what you prefer,0
784,"I had just turned 21, so I don't recall entirely what was going on. \nBut I had quite a wonderful time.\n\nThere's a nice inside area with dancing/dj etc\nand a chill outside area where you can get fresh air by the pool.\n\nHighly recommend it!",1
785,"\""""Authentic Mexican Food\"""" seems to be a complete lie here. I feel like Taco Bell is more authentic than Espo's. 2 Stars, because the Carne Asada Taco Salad I got was nothing but a bowl of lettuce, a few chips, and small balls of Carne Asada every once in awhile. They took over 30 minutes to deliver our order. (There was only about 5 people in the entire restaurant, 3 of which were already eating.) Then, they got our orders wrong, and also charged us extra to put something that was already included in the salad on the side. Only good thing: The Salsa, and the Bowl it came in.",0
786,"Great, fresh sushi at reasonable prices. All you can eat dinner for $26, plus free dessert to complete the meal. Only downsides to the AYCE is that 1) it doesn't include sashimi, and 2) if you don't finish everything you pay the $26 plus a charge for any remaining rolls. However, if you have one or two you that just can't handle they'll usually cut you slack. Service is decent and friendly. Overall a great hidden gem everyone should try.",1
787,"Very, very poor customer service. I was just on the phone with an older woman trying to explain what was going on with my car (so that she could direct me to the right department) and she was unfriendly, rude, not helpful and then transferred my call when I was mid sentence! I was already a little hesitant about calling the dealership, since I am not the most knowledgable when it comes to cars. I am definitely not going to Shadyside Honda to service my car.",0
788,"CMCU This credit Union is engaging in the same shady business as banks. They process the large amounts first, even if they are more recent than your small charges; all in the hopes of over-drafting your account then charging you $33 fee for each overdraft. Shameful!!",0

790,"have driven by this place since it opened - I should have never stopped this time....\n\nfigured it would be a typical sports bar with the typical food - it was and maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if there was more than one server for the entire place.    Thankfully, the poor girl had an amazing attitude - i sure wouldn't have if I had been her.\n\nthe food was what you would expect from bar food - the wings were good, hubby's pork sandwich was good - the side he got was wrong, but we didn't complain or he probably would never have eaten.\n\nI have been on a mac and cheese kick lately and this mac and cheese had bacon and amazing mushrooms, but obviously made with a brick of velveeta - which really isn't cheese in my book.\n\nthe clientel was interesting to say the least - by listening to the diners next to us we learned where to score some great weed....\n\nwe won't be back",0

The menu at Cooperstown is pretty extensive - lots of options.  \n\nThe service was very quick and efficient.  I see no reason to go anywhere else before a D-Backs game.",1
792,"Worst service I have experienced in years of dining out.  People working here don't even know their own menu even though it's posted on the wall.  I tried to order an Italian Sausage sandwich, but the women at the counter were very confused and acted like they never heard of such a thing!  I had to point it out on the menu, but that didn't work.  When my sandwich was brought to the table, it didn't look like what I ordered, but I took a bite and found it to be a sliced pork sandwich.  When I told the server that it was the wrong sandwich, she asked if I wanted to send it back, but never offered any apology even though she was the one that took my order.\nI was so disgusted that I walked out.  I will never go back, but I can't imagine they will be open very long with such poor service.\nI was there at lunchtime and there were only 2 other people in the restaurant.

The restaurant was packed and everybody looked like they were having a good time.\n\nWith our party of 6, most of us ordered the surf and turf deal with respective sides. My gf and I got that along with the carrots and risotto.   Take note that the sides are HUGE and definitely family style. The filet mignon and shrimp was satisfying.\n\nAfter feasting, we ended the night with chocolate souffle and ridiculous sized serving of coffee.

795,"Good food and atmosphere.  Unfortunately, we felt ignored by the staff.  We had to flag down servers for drinks and condiments.  The manager spent most the time we were there chatting with friends at the bar and watching the game.  This was not our first visit but it was our last.",0

797,"Currently sitting in the restaurant. Got seated very quickly, around 7:10pm. For the first time ever, the restaurant actually had more than myself and my fianc\u00e9 in it. We sat until 7:30 without so much as a \""""Hello\"""" from a nearby server. People were sat after us and have already received food. We finally had to go up to the front to tell the hostess we had not been addressed. She then came and took our orders herself and finally just filled our water glasses. I've never received great service here, but it's never been this subpar either. This may be the last straw for this place. Three strikes and you're out, Mark-Pi.\n\nP.S.

That coupled with the fact that he didn't know how to count back change [but rather held out his hand and dumped all my coins and dollars into my palm] was the last straw! Terrible!  The store should be embarrassed. Please. Try to hire young employee's with even a little bit of professionalism.",0
799,"Delicious, Pricey and Fancy.  All that is Vegas.\nWe were one of the first to arrive since they open for dinner only, and we got great service because of it!  \nWe ordered the Kobe beef tacos which were just awesome.  The meat was so savory and a little sweet - so good - and the little chips turned taco shells just came out of the fryer and still warm.   We also order Cali Rolls, which were also good.  And a cucumber salad - a nice addition.\nThe hubby ordered 10 pcs of sushi - Unagi, Salmon, Squid (super chewy) and Tuna.  He was all about it, I took a pass.  I had my fill of apps and was satisfied.\nI love Sapporo so I stuck with that, but Joe had the Cucumber Essence - which is made up of cucumber infused vodka and other light yummy mix ins that made for one deliciously refreshing drink.  \nIt's expensive.

800,"Would probably never come here again unless I absolutely had to.  Service was extremely poor, food was overpriced and not that great.  I had a veggie burger and fries which was okay.  Friends had nachos- the cheese on them was kind of funky but the toppings of beans, jalepenos, olives, etc were okay.\n\nOriginally we were going to get the appetizer platter but after hearing how many pieces of each item were on the platter, it was way to overpriced and didn't seem that great.\n\nGood: not much...standard cafe fare\nBad: service, price, food\n\nOverall: Like I said, I probably wouldn't come back here, it's really not worth it.  It is the only food place open late at TI but the menu is pretty limited.  Don't expect great service...I waited forever to get water refills!!",0
801,Don't go.. really poor service.  Sat and waited for 25min to get a beer no such luck.   The servers just kept walking by me like I was invisible.   I could understand if they were busy but I was the only one sitting in my row.  I just don't get it.   Told the manager and then left.,0
802,"Normally I don't review places like this but as it was important for our trip to come here, I figured I would post a review. My friend was in from out of town and we made an impromptu trip to Vegas for the weekend. He didn't have any dress clothes so we lender him clothes but we still had no dress shoes so we didn't plan on going clubbing. We ended up getting on the guest list for pure at Caesars (read my review) and we needed to get him dress shoes. We came here and got a nice pair for $30 and now he has a pair to leave in town for if we make another impromptu trip. The selection is standard with every other Ross I have been to so it didn't seem anything special, but the reason I rated it 2 stars is because of the staff. Checkout takes forever because the cashiers take their sweet time to check stuff out and they only have 4 check stands open for the line of like 25 people. And then they work slower than molasses flowing uphill. It took us like 30 minutes to finally get checked out\n\nIt works out if you are in a snag and need to get something, but leave time to get your stuff cause it will take you a while",0

804,Plams is my favorite hotel in Vegas. My wife and i go there about 2 times a year. I like the way the casino is laid out and they have plenty of restaurants and even a movie theater. We always try and stay in the fantasy tower. The rooms there are big enough and they have great views. There is always something going on in the MANY clubs they have. If you want a casino and hotel that not too many OLDER people hang out at...this is the place for you.\n\nPeace Out \nMZ,1
805,"Yes, the Wynn is expensive. If you're going to eat in any of the cafes and restaurants here you just have to accept it. And if you're exhausted from a night of gambling you probably won't have the energy to wander very far for a bite to eat in the morning. But that being said, I felt like I *almost* got my money's worth with the veggie breakfast bagel. It was huge! There must have been around 4 egg whites in there. It was a tad bland since it was basically poached egg whites with a bit of spinach, but it was fine with a touch of salt, and totally filling. They also have a sausage or bacon breakfast bagel if you're so inclined. \n\nAt $8ish it was a good deal for a simple, quick breakfast compared to the Terrace Pointe Cafe which had more elaborate breakfast choices for double the price. If you can wait until 10 am, Sugar & Ice (towards the end of the shopping esplanade) also has some cheaper breakfast options, though I didn't have the chance to try any of them.",1
806,"Watch your fingers!!! My friends and I went to this restaurant expecting great food and great service. I have to admit the food was good, but the management at the restaurant was absolutely terrible! One of the servers cut my friend's finger with a knife. They were initially apologetic, however, when the manager came out he was the most ridiculous person I've ever met. He stated he would not comp the meal because the \""""cut was not that big\"""" despite the blood soaked napkin my friend had on the table that suggested otherwise. He was unable to define how large the cut needed to be before he was willing to pay for the meal. He then began arguing with my friend as she was upset with the way he handled the situation. This place may have decent food, but this by far was MY WORST EXPERIENCE IN VEGAS!!!",0

There is a large children's section for the kiddo's. \n\nYou need video games. They got some. Yes, besides books they have some entertainment items.\n\nTeachers need to pick up some good reads for the class?

808,"There is only one hurdle to get past at FireSky - you must find the entrance!! The rest is a cakewalk. \nUpon finally figuring out how to get to the front desk, we were promptly checked in by the friendly front desk attendants.  They explained everything and then sent us back in our car to drive in a big circle to our building, which was quite close by but only accessible by driving all the way around the complex.\nAfter our circuitous route we settled into our spacious and clean room.  I liked the room, although I didn't feel there was enough light.  There was only a sliding door, with no window.  Add a window and it would have been just perfect.\nThe bed was plush, the furniture minimalist and the shower spacious.  Outside, there are two large pools.  One is a zero-entry pool with sand and the other is the more adult pool with beautiful pillar fountains pouring water into the pool.   This pool is surrounded by cabanas and lounge chairs and is attended by some friendly young servers.  We ordered drinks and relaxed.\nI loved the modern aesthetic and the gardens and pools in the center of the resort, however the guests seemed like the type to be attending a motorcycle or police convention.  Nothing against them! It just surprised me, as I thought it would be all girl's spa party but the fun and playful hotel attracts all types.\nWe enjoyed our stay and at the rate we payed, we would gladly return.\n**Look out for great summer rates!**",1

The jets are disgusting. \nMold on travel soap. \n\nNever again.,0
810,"Very good! If you're craving fry bread, this is the place to get it. And yes, real Indians are working there! Its very fresh. The only complaint is that they charge you for extra honey. The hours aren't great either. But its good weather it is dessert or lunch time!",1
811,"I love this place.  After seeing the hotel on Top Chef, I couldn't wait to step foot into this landmark (in my mind, at least).  It looked a lot smaller than it appeared on TV.  Weird.  But once you step inside, the place is gorgeous.  It's not on the strip, and you'll probably have to use some sort of transportation on wheels to get here, but it's worth it.  My family and I came here for Christmas dinner, thinking since it wasn't in the crowded area, that it would be easier to get food.  Wrong.  It was chaos everywhere for Christmas.  There were a million and a half people vying for seats in this extremely new buffet.  So many that they did a time system for people to come back and wait in line.  We got there at 6:30pm, our time slot to return to wait in line was 9:30pm.  Buffet closed at 11pm.  We had no choice but stay.\n\nWe played the penny slots until it was our time to wait in line.  My mom won like $40 and I won like, $30 on the penny slots.  Already love this place even more.\n\nWe waited in line and we finally got in.  Since it was Christmas dinner, it came with beer and wine.  You can only get one at a time, but you can get as many as you wanted, as long as you didn't feel embarrassed.\n\nThe food was fresh and hot.  Everything was well made, with high quality.  Our server was super attentive.  Everything was gorgeous in there and everything looked good to eat.  Their dessert counter was super long and they served gelato!  I love gelato.  We all stuffed ourselves with fresh king crab legs and shrimp cocktail.  I love seafood.  And when a buffet has fresh, high-quality, not-too-salty seafood, I like it that much better.\n\nI wish I had 4 more stomachs to fit in all I wanted to eat.  Yes, I am a pig.",1
812,"My buddy and I were leaving back to LA and we wanted to try a new place off the Vegas strip so we drove down Sahara and stumbled upon the Vegas Grille.

In my opinion, it definitely beats all the fancy expensive BBQ restaurants!",1

I immediately jumped on Yelp to find a local AC repair service in my area. And that's when I found AC Doctors.\n\nI called them up and immediately set an appointment for same day service. Frank and his assistant showed up at 745 and immediately diagnosed the problem. Some wiring outside had fried and needed to be replaced. An hour later, as I'm posting this review, my house is cooling and I'll be able to sleep comfortably tonight.\n\nFrank gave it to me straight and said that two components would need to eventually be replaced sometime in the near future. But he didn't try to sell me, or scare me into making a decision. He even emailed me a copy of the invoice with his recommendations in case I need to reference them in the future. If I have an AC issue again, I won't hesitate to call AC Doctors!",1
814,"What a disappointment. Mediocre, overpriced food. The pimento cheese \""""sandwich\"""" is about a nickel's worth of cheese on two overly dry, overtoasted pieces of bread. The chicken and dumplings was a small watery bowl of dry chicken and, again, about a nickel's worth of dumplings. The hummus and pita was fine. The kids mac and cheese was average. The bill? Nearly 40 bucks, which is about twice as much as it should have been. This is the kind of overrated place that everyone is supposed to love because of its retro hipster vibe. But the food is better at Waffle House.",0
815,"I'm sitting here and listening to the worker complain loudly while I eat. First it was the way people closed, then it was their green cards and then who knows what else. The ice tea had three cubes of ice, the hash browns were cold and the toast was dry. No melted butter on the toast.",0

819,"We went here for lunch as it was quite cheap (6 pounds for a main, 8 for a main and a starter).  We were very happy with the food, particularly the nachos melt we got as a starter, which was filling enough to be a meal to itself, made with what seemed to be home-made chips and salsa.  The burrito was also very good and filling.  I would recommend going for lunch, or only getting some large nachos -- the other dishes are too expensive for what they are on the evening menu.",1
820,"Its 4 A.M. You've been out partying in Vegas all night and staring you in the face is a huge Denny's sign.

So, you head in, sit down, and in a dizzy drunken frenzy, try to figure out what the hell you want to eat.\n\nMaybe that happened, maybe it didn't. Let's just pretend we're in a world of pure fiction right now. We ended up getting an order of some of the crunchiest most delectable cheese sticks I have ever had. While more than half of my friends were passed out, I enjoyed every single bite of mozzarella goodness.\n\nThe great thing about this Denny's was surprisingly the waiter. She could instantly decipher our inebriated state, but didn't give us any attitude or treat us like your typical college students. Instead, she just laughed along with our stupid jokes and was very courteous and timely. This Denny's is perfect if you're hungry in the middle of the night and want to fulfill those munchies that you've been craving for all night.",1

Dinner is where it all went wrong.  Our dinner companions asked several times if the ahi was lightly seared and was assured it would come out sushi grade.  When the food came out I could see from across the table the ahi was completely cooked through.  My husband had to send his lobster back to the kitchen because it was undercooked.  My mahi mahi had to be cut with a knife it was so overcooked.   This was the most disappointing meal we had in Vegas.  I will be sure to advise my friends to stay away - too many great restaurants in Vegas to waste your time.",0
823,"Boring... Perhaps this place is jumping at times other than when we visited but I was sorely under impressed with this place.\n\nThe food was average and nothing really stood out. And hell, all the drinks are overly expensive. $9.50 for a drink the size of a small styrofoam cup? This is Vegas right?\n\nAnyways, the experience I'm sure is greater when its overly packed and has more going on.

The set up of the place is just the kind of cheesy that you'd want from a Vegas skin joint.

828,"We stayed here for a bachelorette party during Labor Day weekend.  We were 9 people in total, and wanted to be able to stay pretty much in a large suite without spending a fortune.  Palms Place suited that bill nicely.\n\nWhile we'd originally booked a 2-bedroom suite and adjoining room, at check-in we upgraded to a penthouse suite and added a couple roll-away beds so we could all be in 1 room.  Best decision we ever made, as it was only a couple hundred bucks more per night (split 9 ways, natch).  \n\nUnfortunately for both us and the Palms Place staff, there were TONS of issues with the first suite they put us in.  A couple girls got locked the master bath on at least 3 separate occasions, the hot tub on the balcony didn't work, the fireplace didn't work, and we didn't have an ice maker, just to name a few.  After several unsuccessful repairs, the staff relented and relocated us to a bigger suite one level up for our last night.  Then they gave us a hard time about getting additional roll-away beds so everyone had a place to sleep, which was unfortunate.\n\nWhile the problems with the rooms led to a less-than-ideal experience, we were all quite thrilled to be staying in a couple awesome suites, with a hot tub overlooking the Strip.  Not too shabby, all things considered.\n\nWhile on future Vegas trips, I might opt to stay closer to the action, if ever I needed a single room for 6+ people and didn't want to spend a fortune, Palms Place would be it.",0

830,"I was really excited to try this place because my fianc\u00e9 and I love dining on the water, but we were pretty disappointed. I think it has potential but they're a little confused on their identity and definitely need to reconsider their pricing. Here are a few observations:\n\n- Pricing is way too high. This isn't Scottsdale and it's not nice enough to get away with the high prices being located off of Baseline in Tempe. As soon as happy hour ended the bar cleared out and everyone went next door to Pier 54.\n\n- The food is ok but the menu is kind of all over the place. \n\n- The place turns into a \""""nightclub\"""" after 8/9ish on the weekends. That was an immediate turn off for us (and we're in our early 30s). It was pretty cheesy.\n\n- Gorgeous views, but the weird uplighting inside the bar reflected off the glass and skewed the view.\n\n- Bathrooms are awful. Both my fianc\u00e9 and I commented on how you could tell they skipped rehabbing the bathrooms and how important that was in a new restaurant. \n\n- There is a cool pool table room in the back and games on the patio but no one was in there. I think this goes back to pricing and a confused identity. \n\n- Our waitress (I think her name was Bailey) was awesome! Very attentive and personable.\n\nWorth checking out for the view alone, but without defining their identity and lowering their prices, I give the place 6 months to a year.",0
831,Check out Geisha any time sunday for great specials on food and alcohol... Good vibe... pretty people and DJ type music on. Great place to roll into in shorts or dressed up. Many different types of sake make this place stand out.,1
832,"Good sandwiches, good price for a filling & quick bite. The bread is really good, served warm & toasty. I didn't care for the turkey meat much but overall it was a good tasting meal. We had the Montagu (mustard sauce was a little sweet) & Club (sandwich sauce was delish) which I thought were good choices. The line was a bit long but not ridiculous considering it was a Saturday night & the service was relatively quick. I would consider coming back.",1
833,"I ordered flowers from Springtime Floral for our 25th Vow Renewal. I orderd  Bouquets, Boutanaires. Centerpiece, Beautiful Room Flowers and Cake Flowers. The Ladies at Springtime Floral did a Beautiful job. It was beyond my expectations. Beautiful colors of flowers  and orchids. They stayed and decorated the room with Beautiful center pieces. And decorated my cake. The Bouqets were brought to us and the boutainares pined on. Our day was perfect  We had nothing to worry about.\nI will use Springtime Floral for all My FLower needs. Love the Ladies there and I can trust them with making my Flower Dreams come true:)",1
834,"As far as buffets go this is one of the better ones! I used to come here a lot when I worked in Matthews, but had not been back in a while. Did lunch here Friday and realized how much I missed this place.\nAs far as Chinese goes this is about as authentic as you are going to get at a buffet. I'm not saying it is \""""real authentic Chinese\"""", but it is for a buffet. You have to know where you are eating.\nI liked everything I had, soups were great, all the sauces I had were pretty good too! Wait staff was on top of refills, clearing the table etc.... All in all a great experience. \nRight now they are running a lunch buffet special for their 12th anniversary. My wife and I only paid 5.99 each, well worth it!",1
835,"I realize Great Harvest is a franchise, but this location has the best couple that run the store, that it's head and shoulders above the others that I have been to.

My daughter went nuts for the apple crumble.\n\nThis was my go-to sandwich place when I worked nearby, and I never got tired of it.  The sandwiches are so fresh and customized to exaclty what the customer wants.  And one cannot forget the sweets - the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are fantastic, as is the chocolate chip scone.",1
836,"Food 4 plus stars, mojito's, if I could give more than 5 I would.\nThe service on this particular occasion, was some of the worst I have experienced.

Keep in mind(Arnold) the busboy brought bread, water and then even finally our first pitcher when he realized the waitress was nowhere to be found. I can understand if you are busy, just swing by my table and let me know you will be with me shortly. Se cmes by to take our order makes up some half fast excus about putting through some orders. Later during the meal the busboy came by and used the new girl excuse. I don't think we will give it a second try, maybe we will give the other location a chance.\nThey did in their defence comp one of our pitchers.\n\nMade us all very sad.",0
837,"Hubby and I have never been here, so we decided to give it a whirl.\nWe made reservation through open table for 5:15pm.  When we got there we were third table in, but by the time we left over half the restaurant was full...now we know why.\nWe started off with the house wine.  I love \""""14 hands\"""" wines and that is the house wine, so Cabernet it was.  Came in a big glass!  Only 6 dollars..!!!!!Ambience inside was very nice, you would never know you were in the Goldcoast.  \nNext came a huge bread basket of piping hot bread and three different butters.  I liked the pesto one the best.  Also a tomato/garlic dipping sauce that was really good also.\nWe ordered the filet 6 oz with baked potato.  It was delicious!  I had a salad and hubby had the steak and potato soup which was glorious.  Most places will charge you for sides or soup and salad.  Here, it comes with the meal!  Our server was excellent and was around only when needed. Our total meal price was 71 dollars for two people with two nice glasses of wine.   What a steal.   If you like old Vegas...you must hit this!",1

The pieces of chicken are as white as can be and never have any grissle. The desserts and specialty drinks are also worth coming for.

846,"Wow what a lounge! My hubs and i while on vacation made it a point to do and see as much as we could. In doing so we probably drank more than we should,as we walked around the city we would stumble upon a place that looked cool so we would take a break and have a drink. \n\n   Le Lab was one of those places. we walked in on a Thursday at 10pm. I was so surprised that we were the only people in the bar. That lasted for about an hour and then it became a popping tiki-esque lounge. The cocktails we had were out of this world awesome. The choice of bitters alone was staggering. Ever flavor imaginable, which made for some pretty terrific cocktails. My favorite drink had to be the jerky Lab Jack, featuring a base of Jack Daniels, BBQ bitters or mist, and a small clothes line featuring a sizable piece of beef jerky. \n\n    I also had the pleasure of having an award winning mint julep made by the man who won the title. It was absolutely phenomenal and exactly the cocktail to enjoy amid the humidity of summer. \n\n   While there we also had the opportunity to talk to one of the owners/investors, Daniel. Who was one of the sweetest and coolest dudes we met while on our travels. He filled us in on the top places to grab a drink. We talked about the differences between the city of Montreal and Toronto. The latter may just be our future home. \n\n  I am so glad we stopped in, and if you ever find yourself in the area you should stop in too!",1
847,"I want to give it a 5 but for some reason i can't do it.  I loved it there.  We had such a great time.  The staff is SUPER friendly and helpful.  That includes our initial call for reservations, calling the front desk with in-room questions, and all the other hotel interaction we had.  We booked a King Suite... initially they had problems when we checked in trying to locate an available room to match our reservation.  I thought this was odd but the front desk seemed confident they could figure it out and they did within about 10 minutes.  I didn't mind the wait and it helped that they were apologetic about it.  I didn't seem like a number, even though I really was for such a huge property.  The room was great.  Remote lights, blinds; TV in the bathroom; swivel big screen covers the living room and bedroom.  The bed was one of the most comfortable I've experienced.  The gym was ok... we liked the one we went to at the Palazzo next door on one day so I think we were comparing it a lot.  I did like that the gym was in the spa area and the bathroom facilities were unreal.  I think one of the biggest reasons I can't give this place a 5 is simply the location.  Its at the end of the strip and a bit far from many attractions.  Not that its so bad... there is plenty to do in the hotel and the immediate area.  I just would have liked to be more central.  I would definately stay again.  But if I found similar deals and had to choose between say the Bellagio and Encore, I would probably just stay at the Bellagio based on location.",1
848,"This store is right near our house, so I run in often.  It's pretty lacking in the features of a grocery store:\n\n- service is terrible - the cashiers are super slow, confused and sometimes disheveled.  \n- the self-checkout machines have an issue just about every time.  i use these everywhere i can, typically with great success....and the attendant is usually nowhere to be found.  When they finally arrive, they're confused and slow.  \n- the selection is paltry - they have pretty obvious things but don't expect many brand choices, options, etc.\n- the prices are a bit steep, compared to bigger, nicer stores, plus they don't seem to have a lot of sale items\n- the produce is pretty terrible.  the guy who works in that department will cheerfully help you pick a pineapple, though.\n\nIn summary, if you don't live just down the street, avoid this place.",0
849,"If you are very hungry, try this buffet.  We were starving, just checked into the Hotel, and found this Buffet the answer to our stomach's prayers.We were seated at the Bar due to an opening, so did not have to wait for an hour.  The bar tender, Georgie was so fun, loved her job, and kept our glasses full.  The highlight for me was the bluenose fish with rice, and the shrimp sauteed with peppers, all in all delicious.  My husband, the carnivore, loved the beef wellington.  I was disappointed with the crab legs, too frozen.  I would recommend getting in line alittle early to beat the rush, or sit at the bar like we did.  Outstanding buffet!!",1

A bucket of beer and we were set to go!  Everything was delicious, and it was a fun place to eat with communal picnic tables and self service everything.  Their sauces had great spice, or you could get sissy sauce if you wanted less heat.  I wish they had wet wipes though, it would have made the experience much less messy considering the amount of ribs we had.",1
851,"Worst and most unorganized location in town.  Pizza never \""""hot and ready\"""" like advertised and you generally have to wait about 20 min for a basic order.  None of the employees ever seem happy with their jobs, they clearly don't communicate with one another, and most of them have no idea what customer service means.  I know it's only $5 pizzas, but common courtesy to your customers is free!\n\nToday I came to this location at 10:50 am (opening time is 10:30 am) and the doors were still locked.  I could see one employee inside messing with the safe and getting the drawer set up.  Shouldn't this have already been done?  Employee told me through the door that the manager didn't show up and it's gonna be at least another 20 min before he could start a pizza.  Clearly there is something seriously wrong at this location when the store manager doesn't even show up and leaves it to the employees to run the store.  I hope someone from corporate headquarters reads all reviews and cares enough to get over to this location and fix the issues in this store.  After today, it will be a long while before I visit this location and give them my business....if ever.",0

The problem I had, the one that caused me to stop frequenting this shop to write, STILL exists - its Internet connectivity stinks. At this coffee shop you CANNOT stream video or music, you cannot instant messenger, and it takes 15-30 seconds to pull up a web page (this includes the dictionary.com or any link off a Google search query). Sadly, crappy WIFI is very annoying, counter-productive, and does not compensate for decent coffee, good atmosphere and good staff. Aside from times when I'm in the area I likely will not go back.",0

855,"I really hate having to write a bad review, but my visit to this location warrants this.\n\nFirst, I'll talk about the food. Overly priced, the portions were small, our biscuits were hard, and in general for the price, it did not seem worth it. The restaurant was almost empty, but it still took a long time for everything to come out. And we didn't order anything \""""well done\"""" or anything that would be a reason for it to be so slow.\n\nService - Our server was nice and informative. But I saw him so busy running food to other tables, refilling drinks for other tables, even bussing other tables, it was hard to get his attention, when we needed things. I don't fault the server for this, it just seems unfortunate that a restaurant gives so many duties for a server when all they should be doing is working on customer service. \n\nMost likely won't be back.

856,"On the first day of my Vegas Vacation I realized somewhere during our travels to Vegas my camera had broke. Ugh. My mind was preoccupied by the thought of a vacation with no camera. I lamented the whole morning about my options, ruling out disposables because no self respecting photog would stoop that low. I even called all of the local camera repair shops with no luck for a place to get my broken baby repaired. I started to get frustrated as we walked to the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. I finally had a mini-meltdown where I burst into tears by the fountain at the shops. After wiping away my tears I looked up to see a beacon of light - no wait, it was just the Sony Style shop where I bit the bullet and bought a brand new Cybershot for $180 (totally compatible with the fully charged battery and 4GB memory card from my broken camera). The day was saved! I immediately started taking pictures and felt a million times happier.\n\nLong story short, thank god for this store.

Given the huge choice of fancy restaurants in Vegas, and the presence of an in-n-out burger, I see no reason to eat here.  Portions weren't huge, and my pasta jambalaya was bland and generally lacking in meat.

To start, we signed a few things and were told the rules and then the story began.  A mystery was presented to us then we traveled to the next location to search for clues.  It took us to a third location which was done up fantastically!  They really worked the locations into a good mystery.  Our group worked well together and with a little assistance from our driver (Joe, I think his name was) we solved the mystery!  There were drinks and snacks available to us on the bus and we got a certificate and prize at the end.

Ok... then I glanced at the muffin selection for an alternative.  No bran muffins or corn muffins (my two favorites).  That sucks!  So, I ordered an iced coffee with sugar-free vanilla flavoring and left in a flurry.  I took a sip and it was pretty gross - way too much syrup!

866,"I'm surprised by the positive reviews on this shop. I can't speak to the lolli cakes or ice cream concoctions (which is why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1), but I had the opportunity to try an assortment of the chocolate treats. Based on the reviews I expected to enjoy them, but I was very disappointed. First, the chocolate wasn't glossy, and some of the pieces had the grayish film that indicates age, improper tempering, or extreme temperature variations. Also, the chocolate did not taste smooth and velvety like good chocolate should. Instead, some pieces were almost flavorless, and others left an unpleasant aftertaste. The idea of sea salt caramels is a good one, and I've sampled successful samples in other shops. But here the proportions of chocolate, caramel, and salt are off, and the salt is too overpowering. Chocolate can be tricky, but in a city with numerous choices, there are many other better options.",0

The price is $13.99 unless you have their card and then it's $9.99 and believe me you would be much better off going over to ANY fast food joint.

On a regular Saturday night, I waited 45 minutes for a drink while sitting at the bar. They have somehow hired the slowest staff in the world and then encouraged them to work even slower. If you have to wait here for your table at Piccolo Forno, do so, but bring a book to kill the wait.",0
870,"YOUR GUIDE TO A SUCCESSFUL FLAMINGO HOTEL STAY\n\nAfter pretty much reading nothing but negative reviews I think I need to share what I think makes for a great Flamingo Hotel experience.  We have done an annual man-cation here for the last 4 years in July and  I don't have a single complaint and below are a couple reasons why.  I do understand the Flamingo can be a little difficult to navigate and in some aspects has kind of turned into a In and Out Burger type establishment where you need to know the secret menu but here is your secret menu:\n\n1.  This is the FLAMINGO so you are already setting yourself up for failure if you go in expecting the Wynn or some other fancy hotel I have only seen the outside of.  Wrap your head around that before booking at this hotel.  I am not someone who subscribes to the theory of just getting a crap hotel because you are never in it.  I want a good bed and nice shower even if I do plan on being in the room 6 hours over the course of 3 days.  You can still get a quality room at the Flamingo if you know what you are doing\n\n2.  BOOKING A ROOM:\nWhen you get a room spend the extra money and get a Go Room.  Don't pay for the upgrade for the rooms with the crap fake wood floor.  A Go Room I say.  Don't pay for a suite unless you are already in a gambling mood.  Some can be great and others can look like an apartment circa 1972.  Getting a standard room is like asking for your room to smell of cat urine and vomit.  Again if you are in the gambling mood give it a whirl.  The Go Rooms are clean for the most part and modern.  Good shower and bed with an I pod docking station for listening to good jams before you go out.\n\n3.  CHECKING IN:\nThis can be a cluster mess of epic proportion if you allow it but follow this method and you will be good to go and laughing at the individuals in line for hours having a breakdown. We do this every year and have not had a problem yet.  First, DO NOT arrive at check in time and actually do not check in after 1pm ever.  Figure out a way to get there early.  Last year we tried to check in at 8am.  Of course we couldn't but that is not the point.  If you are flying to Vegas have the cab driver drop you off at the Valet and call over a bell hop.  If you drive to Vegas go to the Valet and call over a bell hop.  The bell hop will take your bags and give you a ticket.  First problem already solved.  Now you have just avoided being the people carrying their luggage through the hotel running into trash cans and small children along the way.  The people with their luggage on the Strip are hopeless so forget about them. Now you may be able to check in early for a small fee and if so great, you simply call down when you get to your room and your bags arrive and everybody is happy.  Now if you are like us and try to check in at 8am this is never going to work but what you will do is knock out everything that is needed with the front desk so when you come back at 3pm or whenever you go into a different line.  A few minutes an then you get your room key and are done because you have already completed the credit card/ID crap.  When you try and check in too early at the front desk they will point out this separate line for you to get in later in the day.\n\n4.  The POOL:  First of all RIP to the small pool which used to be the 21 and over pool and was topless at one time.  Nobody actually went topless, well a few people did but you get the idea.  So the large pool is 21 and up and the small pool is for families.  Families this hotel is really not the place for you.  You might think the location is great but I have about a million reasons why you should not stay here with the little ones. The Flamingo pool scene is good times and it is not the whole Encore pool scene vibe.  Get there early really early if you are the kind of person who wants a chair.  Remember this pool is also open to Bill's guest as well so the chairs fill up quick.  We usually pay the $200 and get the day bed for the day and there you have a home base to place your things, sit, lay or whatever you little heart desires.  It comes with a couple of free drinks or a bucket of beers.  You are in direct line for the booty shaking contest in the afternoon as well.  It is kind of cheesy but everyone is having a good time so just cheer for the brave girls who get up there and shake that thang.   The pool is big enough so although everyone is peeing it really does not effect you or at least me. I will say the vibe at the pool was a little weak this past year.  I thought the DJ just turned it to the local FM top 40 station and called it a day.  I am not trying to hate at all but the crowd did look a little rough around the edges.  You know what I am talking about.  Some really LARGE white people with their umbrella drink in one hand and a basket of whatever nasty mess they ordered at the snack shop in the other.  Still plenty of good looking people.  Hope this helps",1

873,"Trey, our server had us as soon as he said: \n\n\""""We're just a small locally owned restaurant with a Mama and two boys. We don't have a freezer or a deep fryer, we make everything, including our mozzarella in house\"""". \n\nHow could I NOT love this place!\n\nIt's got a cozy interior, most everything is made in-house, and our server was super helpful in recommending dishes and telling us about how each is made. Just don't whiz by and miss this place, because it's easy to do, despite it's prominent position smack dab in the intersection of some busy streets. \n\nTo the food!\n\nAppetizer, Ricotta/Goat Cheese Crostini: Super fresh tasting ricotta and goat cheeses, melted and toasted on a pizza crust like bread, light and airy and super crisp. Delish!\n\nMargarita Pizza: Just how I like it.  Fresh home made mozz, big slices of tomato, plenty of basil and the crust in a crunchy, chewy, olive oil brushed crust.  Super fresh. \n\nThe creme de la creme...the jewel of our meal...the warm-your-insides-on-a-brisk-fall-day...the stuffed cabbage. We were told the cabbage is pickled in a barrel for a month, then stuffed with bacon, ground beef and other ingredients, and cooked for 4 hours until it's delightfully tender and flavorful.  The two stuffed cabbages come in a super savory, salty broth you sop up with either the homemade bread, or...what we did, our pizza crusts. \n\nThe strawberry, banana and hazelnut chocolate crepe was recommended to us, and perfectly eggy, lacy and brown on the edges...with a nice cup of tea it was the perfect ending to our meal. \n\nIntermezzo is definitely my latest restaurant obsession!\n\nTIP: Mama loves Tennis and Djokovic so the Tennis Channel was on both the TVs we saw. Our good service, delicious food and stories behind the restaurant made me want to write Djokovic's agent, and ask if he could send Mama an autographed photo.",1
874,"I ate here about 2 weeks ago and the food was simply divine. It really does taste like something straight from New Orleans. I had the seafood gumbo (that comes with cornbread) and the alligator bites. The alligator bites are amazing, however, it might be the only overpriced thing on the menu ($10 appetizer). The seafood gumbo was dee-licious! For dessert, I had the bread pudding! AMAZING! I had a mimosa to drink with my meal. I was visiting from NJ and was extremely pleased with the food. The service was equally wonderful. I had a waitress named Stephanie who is an enabler haha! But I'm glad she convinced me to get the bread pudding. This place has good food, great service, and is priced right. Def check it out. You won't be disappointed!",1
875,"You did it again Jason! Just visited my fav spot in Pittsburgh this week...again. Love the handcrafted drinks at this place! Jason made me a Daughter Maitland, an original created by this interesting fella! When you're there ask for him & just try it..you will not be disappointed! Cecil is another mixologist that is super nice & enjoys engaging in interesting conversation! Just a great experience overall! Merry Christmas & I'll see you in Jan.!",1
876,"The food and service was outstanding, and the NFL special was well worth $21.99 for a large 1 topping pizza, chicken wings and a pitcher of beer.  The meatball pizza was delicious and not over the top.  The Italian wings were very good and of course...BEER!\n\nWe sat in the couch and lounge area which was close enough to the bar for good service, but far enough away to not be impacted by the various conversations going on at any good bar. The service was excellent and I felt as if they were starting to read my mind at one point.  We were a pretty good size group, but they still managed to keep the food and beer flowing without hesitation.\n\nThis is defiantly a NY Giants bar, but being the only Cowboy's fan in the place, they welcomed me with good banter and ribbing.  I felt like a welcomed guest even though the Cowboy's actually won (still a little shocked myself) and ended up winning a t-shirt from the raffle drawing.\n\nI have some NY Giants fans which have been looking for a good bar for games, so I will definitely recommend this to them and will be back for sure.",1
877,"Wow, this particular location is situated on a busy street and yet nobody has done a review? Ok so here's mine. When it comes to fast food taco joints the two names that come to mind are Taco Bell and Del Taco. Im telling you right now, I am never gonna do a review for Taco Bell unless I am blown away by some memorable event foodwise. \n\nDel Taco has better choices, specials, and heck, you can even order a burger off their menu if you're bored with tacos or just wanna change it up a bit. That's pretty bold I think and I do admit that their bacon double del cheeseburger is pretty good. \n\nA lot of people tend to go here on tuesday nights for dinner. Why? Because tuesdays are taco nights! This is what a lot of college going students live for! A lot of good food for not a lot of money! Most places have 2 tacos for 99 cents or 3 for 1.29! You can choose either hard or soft tacos. I think the most tacos I ever ordered were 40! I had a grip of people up in my house and I only paid around 20 bucks for a boat load of tacos! Hell yeah!\n\nJust about everything on their menu is the bomb! I have yet to begun to scratch the surface! Also I dont ever remember getting any bad service from these guys whether its this location or another. Most locations are 24 hours so for you peeps that get the munchies at 2 in the morning for some reason or another (you know who you are!), then you are definitely covered!\n\nSo for more info on their menu, go to: www.deltaco.com",1

I took a couple of lessons with Travis and loved it!

880,"Ok first off I have been a long time, and I mean long time, customer of Verizon Wireless... I'm talkin 15 years! So a friend of mine tells me on June 27th that I need to use my upgrade by tomorrow (June 28th) in order to renew my current contract and retain my unlimited data package. I called Verizon's customer service that day, the 27th, and asked them if that was necessary and they told me no, that it wasn't necessary for me to upgrade right then and that  my current plan wouldn't change at all. Specifically, my unlimited data plan. In an effort to cover all my bases I had my husband call and confirm this also. They told him the same thing, that nothing would change and that we did not need to upgrade until we wanted to. So fast forward to today, June 20th, I go into the Verizon store in Chandler on Frye road. The salesman tells me that upon upgrading I will need to decide on which new plan I would like to move to. I'm like, what?!?!?! I explained to him that I spoke with a Verizon representative back in June who assured me that I would not loose my current unlimited plan when I upgraded and signed the new 2 year contract. He told me, and these were his words, \""""Well, the lied to you\""""! WTH!!!!! I was majorly p'd off!!!!! I told him that I would not be upgrading anything until I called into the Verizon's customer service department to get this all worked out. So, I go home and we call and we get the same ol rigamarol from Terrence, the Verizon rep. Blah blah blah.... can I please speak to your manager... 15 minutes later (yes I was on hold for 15 minutes), Alisha the so called manager gets on the phone. She apologizes, not in a nice way, and says those plans are no longer available and that she can't help us. She says the reps did not know that the plans would no longer be available when we called in to ask the question. I call BS on that! I called one day before the new \""""plans\"""" rolled out. You seriously ganna tell me that  the Verizon reps were left in the dark on that one. I think not! Long story short, she gets mad at me for saying that the Verizon rep and that Verizon itself are liars and hangs up on me. I am now going to shop around and look for another cell service provider. I feel I have been lied to and that they don't give a damn about their customers. I refuse to pay anyone for that kind of service. Good luck to all of you who have not upgraded yet.",0
881,"Was in town for the Ultra Swim event that was happening right across the street at the Mecklenberg Aquatic Center. We received a special room rate that was negotiated by SwimMac so thanks guys for that. I would have been kind of annoyed to have paid the full rate.\n\nAs many others have said they are trying to put off that The Blake is like the Mondrian or something like that but it is not. A bunch of modern furniture/interior design does not a good hotel make. (although the lobby pool table was in heavy use by many of the swim teams in attendance)\n\nThings seemed pretty clean but the hallways smelled of carpet cleaner or something and the elevators are kinda creaky and you never know which one is coming.\n\nGood Points:\n-Bed-bigger and more comfortable than my bed at home\n-Location-easy to get to where we were going and other places\n-front desk received our packages and had them brought to our room\n\nBad Points\n-the much maligned showers-I don't much love the glass wall/stand up scenario and the water temp was okay when I used it but I HATED the shower head.\n\n-my main gripe was with the breakfast situation-breakfast was part of our room rate. The first two days we ate in the Milano \""""restaurant\"""" portion from a buffet. The buffet was okay although by day 4 if I was one of the coaches or swimmers staying at the hotel I would have been pretty annoyed because it was sub par. We had vouchers for everyday including our fifth morning which was Monday but there was no breakfast to be found-whatever.\n\n-Charging for internet/parking\n\nI would maybe stay here again if we were attending the Swim meet but will definitely investigate other options.",0
882,"We came here on a First Friday which worried me a little bit.  Trying to get good service at a location downtown on a First Friday is like trying to get an alligator to drop it's lunch in the middle of it's barrel roll.  (You like that simile?)  Well, we got great service.  Our server was so friendly and attentive and helpful.  It was a huge change from the first time I went to this restaurant when it was called something else.\nI had the Boston Tea Party cocktail: vodka, lemonade, and green tea I believe.  If that's wrong, that's what it tastes like.  It was great.  I love vodka.  For dinner, I had the loaded mac and cheese.  Judge me all you want, it was worth every gram of fat and carbohydrates.  It was filled with lots of chicken and lots of bacon and lots of cheese.  After this meal, I realized how amazing life is that my taste buds have the opportunity to indulge like this.",1

884,"I can't complain about the food. Everything was pretty good... the hummus, yogurt with cucumber dip, falafel, steak kabobs. The kabob was a huge serving that my wife and  split and couldn't finish. The quality of the meat was good and correctly cooked to the requested temp. It didn't come with Basmati rice, but did have rice pilaf with a wonderful butteriness to it.\n\nTheir menu is ridiculously large with cuisines including Italian, Mediterranean, Persian, Greek, and Indian. In my opinion they'd be better off with a more focused menu, but I guess they have to do what they can to attract the most customers. They even have a kid's menu with all the typical kid stuff. \n\nService was decent and prices were ok. The interior looks a little dated but it was comfortable enough.",1
885,No stars if I could. An employee opened a credit card in my name without my permission. I confronted him and he said I asked for the card. There is no paperwork and my signature was nowhere to be found on any documentation. I asked to see the manager and he wouldn't come out to see me he was in a meeting. I escalated to the district manager. He talked a great game made me feel like things were going to get done and nothing happened. After about two months of waiting for something to be done I had to reach out to Wells Fargo using the toll free line and report the issue. Then I had to contact each credit bureau and report that the card was fraudulently opened in my name so that when I closed it it wouldn't negatively impact my credit report. The whole thing took about 4 months to resolve and I had to do it on my own. Worst of all. The employee still works there....My accounts are now closed. They are under alot of presure to open new accounts. Apparently this leads them to commit fraud and management looks the other way.,0

890,"Delicious. I have been looking for a good fish taco place for years. As a Seattle native, I am picky, and getting fish at restaurants in a land locked state always gives me the heebies unless I go to a 5 star restaurant. This little joint opened up right down the road from my house and lemme tell you, so worth it. First off, the gentleman working behind the counter was awesome. Seriously, this guy loves his job and it is so apparent. He asked if it was my first time then went through all the ingredients in their tacos, what makes them special, and recommendations. Didn't even sound canned, just authentic. I ended up getting the fish tacos (two tacos, so massive) and the seafood chowder. Both unbelievably delicious. Coconuts gets this pacific northwesterner's stamp of approval. I am a customer for life, thanks guys for such a great experience.",1

892,"I gave it 2-stars because all other bubble teas in Madison got 1-star. If you want real bubble tea, make it yourself or go to China town.\n\nThey got some interesting chews for adding to the drinks - mango star (basically flavored agar) and coconut jelly strips. The drinks are way too sweet and insufficient in real fruit for the price they charge. I'd say, get just the plain tapioca milk tea. Every flavor you request in addition will ruin it.",0
893,"My main course of the tortellini was delicious, that being said, everything else was bad. I think it was because they did not seem to want our large party if 11, that on multiple times they let us know was an inconvenience (the restaurant was only 1/3 full), and when our napkins were mildew smellingand we politely asked for new ones, they treated us like we were rude, smelling the napkin and saying the entire bag came back from the laundry like this (hello, why would you out them on thetable then!) We also asked for new glasses because the store the napkins in the glasses. It was just horrible after that. The bread I was excited about was cold, wrong meals and drinks were brought with no apology. There was a good 30 minutes we saw noone, and we went through 4 different waiters. \nThey over charged the gratuity and when we showed them the math they denied it only after asking for the manager they wrote in a new price. I will never go back. Even after all that we were standing out front at the benches saying our goodbyes when 2 different waiters came out and walked around the group. They seemed like they were trying to get us leave but I can't be positive.",0
894,"I want to first say that I really like the food here, but the service is less than mediocre.  And I know this isn't Joel Robuchon at the MGM, where the bussers scrape your bread crumbs off the table with a special bread crumb brush. But for heaven sakes, you are in the hospitality industry as well! I really don't feel their hospitality here! At least ask me if I would like some water? And even when you do ask me if I want water, it is as if you are angry for me coming into the place and having to actually make you work for your dollar! Or why do I have to flag you down whenever I need something? \n\nAs far as food, the spring rolls were decent, but nothing to honestly to rave about. The pho was not memorable, but I have had so much pho, maybe I don't know a good one anymore?  They have no sandwiches also.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor is maybe the best thing that they have going for them, and location.  I really dislike their tables though. I am 5'1 and very small, and I still think their tables are small! The problem is that the tables have this poorly placed bar under them where my husband kept pushing my legs.  Each table is so closely placed. I can almost hear every conversation around me. Not much of a place for a first date. \n\nI love pho, but if there is another pho place at least a mile away from this one... I would choose the other, cause this place can really piss me off. They can be just darn rude here.",0

Yes, it is Pizza Express, but the make over with the modern d\u00e9cor and pretty comfortable chairs, then I was happy to dine here and what is more, I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe new gluten free options means that I had choice here and I thought the pizza was pretty yummy. It is a standard base used - no options on size and thickness but it is thin and crispy, with the right amount of crunch. There are a good range of toppings available (sadly no Sloppy Giuseppe) and my la Reina was tasty and well covered with toppings.\n\nA nice addition is the mini bites with coffee. Dessert is available but you can also get coffee with a range of mini desserts when you want something sweet but can't face a full dessert. There is an option of a gluten free brownie and despite my brownie fatigue, it was really good and just enough to round off a meal.\n\nSo as Claire C has mentioned, there's deals aplenty for Pizza Express so its worth checking before heading here but for tasty food, good service and nice surroundings then it is worth a visit. And for sunny nights, the outdoor seating at The Shore is lovely.",1

900,This was the only vendor offered with our venue and found it a little less than desirable. The person assisting us did not come across as welcoming and her tone of voice was short.  Using square cake pans rather than round cost extra and fondant icing was the only choice available. Their position was that their more expensive fondant was a better quality but it wasn't. The cake and filling was fine; the icing was not. Some of our decor ideas would cost extra and we were unwilling to put that much extra money on a cake upgrade. The result was a mediocre cake.,0

908,"Upon recommendation from an employee at Jiffy Lube, I took my car to Newby's Automotive and ATV Center in Henderson to fix an ongoing problem with my air conditioner.  Basically, the AC would start blowing warm air after a few days following a refill of the unit.\n\nThe manager indicated that my car had a bad compressor which needed replacement along with a new hose, freon and other services that would cost me $1500 (in addition to the nonrefundable $24.95 I had to pay for them just to look at the car.)\n\nI was immediately suspicious of the quote and took my car to Carmax instead who informed that only a new hose was necessary and charged me $50 to perform the repair.  The problem was solved with this relatively minor repair and no additional work has been necessary (this review is being written about ten months after the Carmax fix was performed and I have experienced no problems with the repair.)\n\nNewby's tried to charge me more than $1500 for a FALSE REPAIR that wasn't even necessary.

I arrive 10 minutes after the 20 and they said they were back up and didn't know how long they would be. Not even an estimate. Then I finally get my order after waiting another 20 minutes. When I got home to eat my food, the wings were burnt and there was barely any sauce. Terrible customer service. I have never experienced this at any other BWW in the Phoenix area and I'm always eating there since I love wings. Sad to say this will be the first and last I will ever come to this location.",0
910,Simply awful.. Long line and wait and terrible food. If I wanted a French fry and coleslaw burger I would of ordered one. Will never go back and I will discourage anyone from making the same mistake as me. 70 years you'd think they would know how to make a sandwich. All me and my party of 10 could do was laugh at the people taking pictures there. Easily worst meal I've had in years and all 10 of us agreed. Avoid at all cost unless you think want the worst and most unhealthy meal you'll have in years.,0
911,"This is my new favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I went there on Saturday with my boyfriend and two other friends of ours for lunch. We arrived around 12:30 and the place was already busy and had a 20-30 minute wait. We decided to sit at the bar and grab a drink while we waited for our table. I couldn't believe their pitchers of beer were only $5 and they had my favorite, Hoegaarden. \n\nWhen our table was ready the server came over promptly and grabbed us two more pitchers of beer. We started out with the bruschetta however we let the server choose what bruschetta we would be eating that day. If you know me then you know that I'm a snobby/picky eater but I was blown away with the Roasted Peppers and Goat Cheese bruschetta. I would have never tried goat cheese but I'm glad that I did. It was so creamy and flavorful. Also on the plate were: Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Albacore Tuna with Gaeta Olives, Brie & Apples with Fig Spread. We gulped down the last of our pitcher, ordered around round and had another round of their delicious bruschetta. This time the server brought us: Smoked Salmon with Pesto, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese (I'm begging you to try this one), Salami with Pesto and Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios. They were all so mouth watering that I highly recommend all of them. \n\nAt the end of our lunch the server brought over a complimentary desert for us, a salted caramel sundae: vanilla bean ice cream with chocolate covered corn nut's, a pretzel stick and salted caramel. By far the best dessert I've ever had in my life. \n\nPostino's left such an impression on my boyfriend and I that we ordered takeout the next evening. We both decided on the Turkey Panini with a side of salad and the organic chips. They make their own lemon honey dijon salad dressing which tastes great on everything. \n\nI will definitely be a repeat customer at Postino's and I am demanding you to try it out this week/weekend. I promise you will not be disappointed.",1
912,"This place would be a hole in the wall if it wasn't for triple d advertising to the world. Love the emerald chicken and Chinese BBQ pork plus I prefer double pork or chicken fried rice.  You can get any meat in a burrito or as a quesadilla, this is awesome.  Never miss a chance to come here. Great food.",1
913,Love this place. We recently stopped by for breakfast and will definitely be returning. We got their poached eggs and they were delish. But everything looked good so I can't wait to try some of their other offerings.\n\nIt's such a charming little place and they have a cute outdoor patio for when it gets a little warmer. Also love how friendly the staff is. We will be returning soon!,1
914,"We ate here on NYE w/ my cousin's recommendation. I made reservations thinking it was going to be crazy, but actually it was kind of dead, considering it was NYE. It's pretty much your typical teppanyaki restaurant w/ sexual jokes and lots of fire.:P It was really yummy, but I don't think it was THAT special. I suppose the prices were pretty good. I had the Musashi Special which comes w/ the filet, prawns, scallops, and lobster tail. Mmm... drooling now... Husband had the Yoshida Special which is the rib-eye and lobster tail. I wanted to try their sushi too, but that's a lot of food already. Everything was yummy, the chef was cool, and the others at the table were cool too. The fried rice and the veggies are always a good way to start the meal. Oh, and they bring you a salad before the chef starts. For dessert, I had the red bean ice cream and my husband had the green tea. I should have gone with my usual, but I wanted to try something different. Green tea ice cream was better. Good place, I'll come back someday!\n\nOh, don't get any cocktails. They're just okay.",1
915,"As far as casino hotels go, this one isn't the best and surprisingly the majority of the hooter's girls here aren't even that special or sexy.\n\nI keep coming back for the guaranteed 24/7 $3 blackjack tables that are always fun for me to play at.  I swear I could play for days on end if people don't pry me away.",1
916,"For those of you who have given this restaurant a 5 star rating --- WHAT THE HECK WERE YOU THINKING!!!!! WERE YOU DRUNK?\n\nThe food was eeewww...their restrooms were even more eeeewwwww. I saw cockroaches near their kitchen and in the restrooms. The tables were dirty. The carpet looked like it has been there for 20 years...cough, cough.... The service by wait staff was courteous but our food took forever to come out. Tom Yum Soup tasted only like Chicken Broth. The shrimp in it was so bland...eeewwww. The fried rice had some dried out spots making me wonder how long it had  been sitting outside. The prices are way too high for the level of food that was served and apart from that, if  I am going to shell out $50+ for a 2 person dinner than it is expected that the ambiance of the restaurant be at least at the level of PF Changs e.t.c... Really bad experience.",0
917,"We stumbled across this place based on Yelp reviews. EXCELLENT, personable service. I love how authentic everything, including the employees were. I have an Italian last name and they pronounced it beautifully. The rolls are to die for- warm and dripping with butter and garlic. Mixed green salad was so fresh and tasted so good with the house dressing. Loved the Linguine Bolognese - it's the real deal! Portions are very large. Servers are super attentive to every detail and so very kind and appreciative. No wait and fast service. I will refer this to anyone who wants an amazing Italian dinner experience!",1
918,"Thoroughly enjoyed our brunch here.  Service was impeccable.  We were promptly seated and served right away.  The white chocolate and orange french toast was wonderful!  It's texture is more of a cinnamon bun than a classic french toast, which I loved.  The flavors meld together very well.  We also had the tableau breakfast.  The pastry basket was delicious and did not need any of the yummy jams or butters. Chicken sausage was also delicious.  Too bad we were so full from all the food or else we would have gotten the souffle.  \n\nWill definitely come back for brunch here the next time I'm in town.  Am dropping my old favorite (Bouchon) off of the list because service and food has really declined over there.",1
919,"Convenient when shopping in Desert Ridge Marketplace, however, the pizza was just AWFUL. There was too much of the cornmeal on the bottom of the pizza (who uses cornmeal on the pizza anyway?) and the slice was cold when they took it out of the oven.\n\nI would not go back for this pizza.",0
920,"Have been coming here for years...... as good as it gets if you are not from New York and have enjoyed the real deal from Artuso's in the Bronx. My favories are the Black and Whites, Canolis, and the rainbow cookies. Also have a great canoli cake as well.",1
921,One really nice Hotel close to free way access ( 15 north or south bye making right out of the hotel.)\n\nDecided to come and check it out hit a progressive first time and then sat down at a couple of monopoly games almost hit a 1000 pay out! but of course it ticked over and paid out 150 lol. \n\nReally nicely lit casino with lots to do there. From eating restaurants that range from high to low like house of blues etc. \n\nSeemed to have a massive betting room a little smaller poker room but huge 21 tables. \n\nYet to stay over night but perk living local I guess also not triied the pool yet either to do though.\n\nVallet are the nicest I have dealt with to date.,1
922,"Great place with best book prices.  Some of the books are not in the best condition but they are a fraction of the original price, all of them are.  It's amazing.  I'll go in there and spend and hour or two looking through different books.  \n\nThey've got everything I like there, photography, nature and some technology.  I also love stopping in there so I can grab those free bookmarks they have at the register.  Also have a cd, record and vintage book section there that is always fun to look at.  Of all the books I've bought there there were under $20.",1
923,"Slow, disorganized, and it felt like they were more interested in selling glasses, contacts and all the add-ons than the health of my eyes.\n\nI've worn glasses and contacts for 20+ years, and this experience was noticeably different.\n\nI'm sure the eye doctors are probably good...of my two hours in their office, I saw him for 5 minutes.  The rest of my time was spent in the waiting room, with an intern, and being up sold for all the add-ons around my contact and glasses (like a used car dealer selling you the sealer wax).\n\nPros:  solid selection of designer glasses, coffee while you wait in their lobby.\nCons: slow, disorganized, limited time with actual eye doctor, seemingly focused on sales volume and turning patients.\n\nYour mileage may vary, I have definitely come to expect more from my eye doctors and their staff.",0
924,"If you are looking for a qwik meal, qt now offers a wrap or sandwich of your choosing along with a bad of chips and a drink for $5. I picked the southwestern chicken wrap. The wrap was cut in half. The first half was delicious. The bread was extremely soft and tasty. The two face 2nd half was drowned in its own wrap juices and completely nasty.",0
925,Best Italian beef in Vegas!  Was going to take pictures but the food looked and smelled so good it never had a chance... the pizza puff took me back to jr high. Added some pics from my second visit. Poor beef didn't last long enough this time either.,0
926,"I have frequented urban picnic in the past, and have absolutely loved every one of their sandwiches. My favorite was the mushroom sandwich they offered. It was mushroomy creamy goodness.\n\nI was disappointed to learn today that not only has urban picnic changed management, but they have also changed their menu and the amazingness that was the mushroom sandwich is no where to be found. I was also disappointed to see they have changed from their paper takeout boxes to styrofoam. They used to be more earth conscious.:( It's not like they couldn't afford the little bit of higher coat for paper given the menu pricing...\n\nI reverted to one of my other favorites, the curry chicken sandwich. The filling was still delightful; however, what was not delightful was finding that it had not been cut in half and was quite unmanageable as a whole sandwich. Hacking through the sandwich with the flimsy plastic knife provided was a messy nightmare and ended in a broken knife, and an only partially cut sandwich. I am hoping this was just a mistake made by whoever was in the kitchen today, but it only added to my disappointment. The croissant was also quite stale, which explains why it was so difficult to cut through. This could easily be remedied by freezing the croissants you aren't going to use and pulling them out as needed at the beginning of each day.\n\nWhat was a great relief to me was finding they had kept the lavender lemonade! If you have never tried their lemonade, I highly recommend it. It is to die for.\n\nIf anyone knows the new owners at Urban Picnic, please I beg you to urge them to bring back the mushrooms.",0
927,"I have been a devoted Monte Carlo customer for 4 years. Recently they lost one of my very expensive dress shirts. It took forever to replace and they kept giving me the runaround on when to pick up the check. Several times I requested the owner to touch base with me. He never did or the message wasn't delivered. He is either to busy or does not care. Very disappointed with how the situation was handled. I understand things can get lost at the cleaners but it's how quickly and attentive you respond that keeps a customer coming back, which I will not be.",0
928,I'd been here a few times.  I love where it's located in the Madison Square.  I love eating and people watching.  The food is always great and the service is always topnotch.\n\nWe had the Sausage Pizza and the homemade spaghetti. It was one of the best I have ever had.,1
929,Awesome company. I called them and they had someone out within the hour. Their technician had excellent customer service. Very fast and reliable.  Talked to me very clearly and made sure I understood everything in detail. Made me feel very comfortable. He was very knowledgeable. Answered all my questions and had my A.C. running strong again in a couple hours. I would recommend these people to anyone looking for a reputable quality company to get the job done right.,1
930,I would like to rate zero stars but there was no zero option. We spent well over $50.00 dollars for a single pizza and order of wings that was easily the most horrible dining experience of my life. The pizza was so grotesque that nobody even attempted to eat it. The oil/lard had congealed to a solid state and smelled absolutely disgusting.\n\nThe wings were so raw they were rubbery to the touch and nobody attempted to eat those either. We asked for the wings to be well done as this the only way we have ever eaten wings. Suffice to say I will never ever eat this crap hole again and suggest you dont either if you value your health. I spoke to someone who claimed to be the owner and was not offered my money back on completely uneaten and satisfactory food. Needless to say I will be calling the department of health as soon as they open.,0
931,"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  I've enjoyed other Emeril establishments.  I like his show. I love seafood.  I HATE this place. My guess is that people who aren't from areas boasting fresh, abundant seafood might believe the fish they serve here to be \""""delicious.\""""  The atmosphere tried wayyyyyy too hard to be chic without delivering (not unique menu offerings, nor inspired cocktails).  The appetizers were a joke!  We ordered the shrimp and were presented with 3 for approximatley $18.  They weren't particularly special...grilled with overpoweringly spicey sauce.  I ordered a bowl of the fish stew (bland city) and a side of calamari (mostly tenticles). My order, without drinks or tax or tip, came to about $65.  No one in the group enjoyed their meal.  For about $100/person, you could enjoy a much finer vegas dining establishment.",0
932,"I am grateful for the customer service I have received at Bead World. I often shop there because I am trying to fix a piece of jewelry. The staff have been very helpful in suggesting solutions to the broken jewelry I bring them. The prices seem very reasonable and the selection seems pretty decent. The staff have gone above and beyond to help me, (e.g. gluing a stone into place for me.) Plus, it's conveniently located in my neighborhood. I would definitely recommend Bead World.",1
933,"The Summer Time Roll is a deliciously refreshing roll and the highlight of the evening. The Godzilla Roll is super chunky so bring a big mouthed companion with you and it is big in price, too. I would pass on the Crab Roll. Salmon nigiri tasted fresh and the portions were reasonable.  The Karatumba sake was good, as well. \n\nSo why the two stars? Mostly it was based on service and the fact that Uni was not present (just like many other sushi restaurants in town). It took well over 5 minutes after being seated for the server to come around and introduce herself and take our drink order.  It was not a busy night.  \n\nThroughout the whole evening our server only took one empty dish back to the kitchen.  I am fully aware that in some restaurants there are \""""servers\"""" and there are \""""bussers\"""" but I think servers should communicate with their bussers if the servers are less inclined to bus their own tables.  I understand that some servers want their bussers to work for their tips if the servers are \""""tipping them out.\""""  We were left with empty plates at our dinner table for the whole evening.  Our server constantly asked us if we needed more to drink and we might have been more inclined to stay and order more drinks if our table had been bussed.   \n\nEarlier at throughout the dinner, when we asked for soy sauce she grabbed the soy sauce container from an unbussed table that was dripping sloppily with sauce on the outside of the container. Later, because she chose an easy solution, we quickly ran out of soy sauce and she actually had to go inside the kitchen and bring us a filled, clean container. Overall, the impression we received is that of a lazy server.\n\nWe most likely will not go to Stingray again unless it is for a quick bite of a Summertime Roll.",0
934,"My wife and I were in Las Vegas last week. On Monday 22 July 2013, we found Grimaldi's using the Yelp app on my phone. Because of the reviews, we decided to try it. \n\nWe were very satisfied with our experience. It was later at night (around 9 pm) and the place was still busy but we did not have to wait. The restaurant was very clean and well decorated. The salad and pizza were fantastic and the service was also great. We truly enjoyed our experience and were glad we found the place using Yelp. Prices were very reasonable. Highly recommended.",1
935,"My wife and I went to Brazz on a Groupon discount. After reading some of the reviews I was a little afraid that we would be disappointed. That was not the case. We were given perfect service by our waiter Clinton and the others. The salad bar was very fresh and enticing. Each of the meat items were prepared as requested, and these servers were very efficient. We will be repeat customers!",1
936,"Great place.  Came with parents and their friends.  I wasn't expecting much at an active adult community but it was great.  Great wine list, great service and the food was really good.  Oh the view is great if you sit outside",1
937,"First impression?  Spectacular and gorgeous!  We decided to dine here during convention upon rec from my parents.  Since I adore Italian cuisine I was definitely game.\n\nI wish I could remember the name of the cocktail I ordered because it was really tasty.  I do remember that it had blueberry vodka and sage and was really refreshing.  They were featuring a special app with squash blossoms and zucchini.  Yes please!  Fried squash blossoms are such a treat during the summer for my family that I had to try LAVO's version.  I must confess that my Italian Great-Grandmother's recipe is better, but I did enjoy having them in a restaurant.  \n\nFor my entree I selected the ravioli.  It was stuffed with cheese and so much better than what you purchase in the grocery store.  The filling was a little salty for my taste, but it could have been the cheese since some varieties can be a little on the salty side.  Other than that, they were good.\n\nOur server was as sweet as she could be and gave good recs as far as what to order.  I always appreciate that info.  I would have loved to have ordered dessert, but I was waaaay to full to indulge.  Next time...",1
938,"The thunderstorms should've been a foretelling of what was to come.....\n\nWe have been to the location in Downtown Disney (and everything Disney is always uber-organized), so we figured why not, and came here with our nieces that we were watching for the day/night and little one while staying at the Signature. \n\nYou'd think that since this place is supposed to be about the experience and appeal to children that the kids would've had a blast. \n\nI should start off by saying that I called down to make a reservation from our Suite, and was hung up on twice within the phone actually picking up on the 7th ring!! Finally called down to our Concierge and mentioned we were unsuccessful for the last 10 minutes (I waited to call twice more hoping it was an \""""accident\"""" - I know glutton for punishment, but those who know me know I am a huge pushover and ALWAYS think that there are such things as 5th chances....). \n\nAfter confirming a reservation with the concierge, they called back to say that the Cafe said we would have to wait 2 hours for a reservation, but if we wanted to head down now that we'd be able to get seated right away...????? \n\nSo we headed down 2 hours later, just because the girls we're just too into the Lazy River.:)\n\nWhen we got there - the condescending hostess asked me, and OVER enunciated every syllable:\n\"""" I AM SORRY - DO YOU KNOW IF YOU ACTUALLY MADE THE RES-ER-VA-TION FOR TODAY? OR A DIFFERENT DAY? DO YOU UNDERSTAND?\"""" \n\nI blinked back in disbelief considering at 2 pm, half the restaurant was empty, and there wasn't even a line in the walk in area. \n\nSo I fired back with:\n\n\""""Yes, Indeed I understand what you are saying. The reservation is at 2, I called your line from our OWNERS suite in the Signature and was hung up on...\n\n\""""interrupted with - oh we're very busy - so that tends to happen\""""\n\n\""""NOT that that is acceptable, but I had our personal concierge call down for a reservation from the Signature - does that perhaps refresh your memory?\""""\n\n\""""She said, well, I'll see what I can do\""""\n\nWTF ? Who the F treats people that way? You're not freaking Craftsteak or any of the fine dining establishments in the building, and we're not random idiots who wandered off the street.\n\nSo back with the person who thinks that I don't understand her English vernacular, or that I am said random Idiot - we will find something for you but how many children do you have. \n\n4, plus 2 adults, and one of the children needs a highchair. \n\nOK I didn't ask about the high chair, I want to know how many children - can you tell me that?\n\nOK - 4 children, 2 adults I said through a gritted teeth and a smile. After all, the kids are the ones who said they wanted to come here because their friends thought this was such a cool place. \n\nThe entire process to get to our table was like this. \n\nThe only consolation was that the guy who actually seated is was an older gentleman, very pleasant, and when he saw that within a few minutes of us being seated that we were going to have to encounter the wild Elephants bellowing in our faces within less than a foot, he volunteered to move us elsewhere - we gladly obliged. \n\nOur almost 2 year old, and the 7 and 10 year old nieces literally jumped every time the storm started because the elephants trunk would \""""toot\"""" in their direction and shriek whenever a thunderstorm came. Not amusing. \n\nIt took that long for the same cocky hostess to find us a table in a near  half empty restaurant. I think that is her way of trying to f with people with her \""""perceived power\"""".\n\nGood thing it usually takes us about that long to get the kittens in a box and figure out who wants what off the menu. \n\nThe server was nice enough at first.\n\nThen we had to remind him to bring 2 of our drinks, and oyster crackers for the 2 bowls of Clam Chowder. He brought them eventually, after the soup was half way finished. \n\nThe food is TGIF with a twist on the name of the entrees. Like the Rumble in The Jungle Turkey Wrap. Wild Turkey in a Jungle? That should only come in a bottle.... VERY unexciting food really - except for my coconut shrimp = I only had one. Everyone else at the table had one off my plate. Should say something about the quality of the other food. \np.s. WHO THE F charges 10 bucks for a kids Macaroni and small portion of bread? \n\nAt the end of the meal, he did end up bringing our bill to us once he saw the kiddies were done eating. \n\nAfter telling him to charge it to our suite - he proceeded to give me the bill to sign, and mention that if we wanted to leave him a tip that we could do so at the bottom. \n\nGood thing I looked at all the receipts included and noticed the only one that listed the 17% service charge that was already added, was on the receipt he was going to keep for himself.\n\nToo bad, no half stars - that would've gone to the older gentleman who really tried to be accommodating. \n\nThough we like the Restaurant Row available at the MGM/Signature - this place really takes the fun and convenience out of it.",0
939,"We were really excited to see KA and it started out interesting, but quickly went downhill.  If you've seen other Cirque shows and liked them, there's a good change you'll be disappointed witht his one.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there were a few impressive scenes, but the majority lacked the breathtaking acrobatic stunts and was mostly filled with a story line that was hard to follow since they spoke in \""""ka\"""" and WAY too many sword fights.  The only good scene was the jungle-tarzan-esque scene.  \n\nAll in all it was 90 minutes that seemed like an eternity for all 4 of us.

941,"Upstream is tres chic! I've been there multiple times and service has always been impeccable. What else would you expect from an establishment that has linen tablecloths? \n\nMy favorite times to go to Upstream has been for brunch and Thanksgiving. Their brunch is a tad on the high side ($25 I believe) but completely worth it just for a bite of the Brioche French Toast alone.  Along with that I've gone there for Thanksgiving dinner twice and was nothing but pleased with it. They have a complete traditional Thanksgiving spread set up in their bar along with sushi, cooked seafood and other goodies. \n\n\nAt the risk of sounding like George Costanza, they have one of the nicest restrooms I've seen in Charlotte. They also have a cute patio area with cushioned seats that's perfect to enjoy an after work cocktail on and watch the people of Phillips Place. And dare I say, even though it's in the heart of South Park-not an obnoxious number of misbehaved children. To top it all off, they are a part of Harpers restaurant group and offer cooking classes on Saturdays for $35/class (a few of the classes go for $55 or $60)",1

943,"One of the coolest places in Vegas! I definitely loved furniture shopping here. They have EVERYTHING. The shops are located in the 1st and 2nd floor of building A and 1st floor of building C. There are styles for everybody: from modern, wild and flashy celebrity, vintage, east coast old money, to california beach house styles. In addition to that, they have specialty stores that focus on sofas, solid wood furniture, pillows, paintings, rugs, chandeliers, and much much more. Some vendors allow you to buy and bargain directly with them while others require you to go through a designer. If you need a designer, their office is located next to mundo.  Prices here are much lower than retail stores. Also, it seems like delivery charge to out of state could be reasonable. Check out this place and be inspired by all the design! Also if you need a snack, head over to Mundo for great happy hour deals!",1

It's got tons of character and I found myself taking pictures everywhere. The sound was wonderful as well. \n\n We saw Jake Shimabukuro, ukulele virtuoso, there. It was a perfect venue for him. So beautiful, stately, quiet with great acoustics. It really highlighted his performance.\n\nI found out it was built from 1927-1929 in Spanish Midieval and Baroque styles. After a while, it was turned into a movie theater and remained that for years and years. They painted the murals and moldings black during the movie era. In the late 80s they started a renovation on it which was completed in 1997. They brought back much of the original design (moldings, murals, etc.)\n\nNow it's just wonderful. Anytime I see something interesting playing there, the theatre itself will definitely add to the draw. Can't wait to head back!",1

Lunches: two... 45 minutes for SALAD. SALAD. no apologies, one size for the soup (noticed too late the new menu), so $16 later for soup/salad that took over an hour to order, get, eat (rushing to eat)... I'd say I've got to be done here.

The staff was very friendly and they work together as a real team to give their patrons a truly memorable experience. Love it love it love it! The muffins are great and when they found out my daughter hadn't been there before they gave her four muffins to take home with her absolutely gratis. I had the Cobb salad which never disappoints.

952,"I recently had my hair done by Suzanne, and I couldn't be happier!! Most of my family and I have been going to her for 10+ years. She always does an amazing job for both men and women. I got my hair dyed this time. I sent her a picture of what I wanted ahead of time, and she went out her way to track down the perfect colors for the job. She really cares about her work and making sure it is perfect. Again, I couldn't be happier about my hair. So glad she's at a salon right around the corner from my house!",1
953,"We were visiting for 2 nights and really wanted sushi.  So I did my trusty Yelp search and came upon Social House, now located in the Crystals shopping area at GORgeous City Center.\n\nUpon first visual the place is just as stunning looking as the mall. It was dark, sexy, and filled with pretty people. We settled in at the bar and ordered some martinis.  Our bartender was an uber sexy Asian gal wearing a corset. My husband says I need to start wearing corsets too:)\n\nWe started with cucumber sunomono and a couple specialty sushi rolls. One roll was kalbi beef, the other was vegetarian. Loved both of these.  The kalbi was slightly crispy from a quick frying. The vegetarian was filled with a nice bit of cream cheese. Next we tried the Himachi specialty roll and the spicy scallop roll. Again, these were spot on. The spicy scallop came with a yummy sauce that could've been eaten alone!\n\nThe rolls had 6 pieces each. Just enough to fill our tummies and continue on with our night, without feeling too bloated. And they weren't over-the-top expensive either. I think the highest one was $12.\n\nDrinks we're sexy-delish, atmosphere was sexy-cool, service was sexy-attentive, and food was sexy-yum!",1
954,"I've only been a member of this gym for about a week, but so far, so good. \n\nThe pros: \n\n1. They're very affordable - this location is only $16/month with a one year contract, and no initial activation fee. They gave me a month free, which was helpful, and I didn't feel a lot of pressure to 'sign up today'! \n\n2. I can bring a guest with a local ID every single time I work out - and it takes about 30 seconds for a guest to sign in, unlike the 30 minute ordeal it has been at other gyms. They also don't pressure my guests to get memberships. \n\n3. One free training session - which ended up only being about 20 minutes, which I was initially disappointed at -- but I was grateful that it was short the following 5 days when my body was aching. I can't speak for anyone else, but I appreciated my trainer, Russ, who didn't pressure me to sign up for more training sessions and said to feel free to ask him questions at any time. Good guy. \n\n4. Cardio Cinema. It's just what it sounds like - a movie theater with cardio machines. Win. Yesterday they were playing Bridesmaids. Double win! \n\n5. Brand new, shiny equipment. Love a new gym! \n\n6. Open 24/7. For those random 2am workout cravings I get! \n\nThe cons:\n\n1. No pool. Not a huge deal for me, and probably part of the way that they keep costs down. But still - be aware. \n\n2. Sweaty beefy guys who drip all over everything and don't wipe up after themselves. Gross. \n\n3. It's fairly small. There's ample equipment, but I could see this place getting overloaded and machines being hard to come by. Time will tell...",1
955,"I was super excited to check out their HUGE store. Once we started looking around, there were two distinct things I noted. 1. The quality of furniture is NOT very good when considering the pricing. 2. The sales people seemed fairly pleasant when approaching us, but I overheard several conversations between them and they were incredibly unprofessional and down right rude to each other. Geesh, competition!!!  \n\nOther than that, I have no desire to go back. I'll stick with R.C. Willey.",0

The guy helping me guilt tripped me in to buying the pre-paid gas, saying, \""""it'd really do me a favor, since I did you a favor.\""""  So, naturally I couldn't say no.  $50 later and only using a quarter of a tank, I feel like I was ripped off. \n\nI won't rent from Advantage again...sorry...but you got my $50.",0
960,"After a disastrous experience at the Bellagio buffet, we felt as if we had to redeem ourselves by going to a good one.  Our friends said that the buffet at the Wynn was good so we decided to give it a chance.  This place is nothing short of amazing.  They had an omelette station where you could pick your own ingredients.  The sushi there was alright but what do you expect from buffet sushi?  All in all the food was great.  Too bad we didn't stay at the hotel so we couldn't get line cutting privileges.",1

When I finally got to talk to the supervisor DJ Russell, he was very short and unprofessional. He stated it's a process we go through and it got cancelled. I had to pry for answers (which I did not get) and I can hear the annoyance in his voice even though I am trying to purchase tickets through THEIR company. \nMy dad and I have different last names so I could understand why that would be an issue as far as third party authorizations, however he had no reason as to why nor did they call me to state I should pick them up or let me know what was going on. If i did not happen to check my email my grandpa and dad would have been at Bellagio unable to see the show because the employees at Vegas.com are not considerate enough to let their customers know what is going on through a simple phone call. This company is a unprofessional and you are way better off booking tickets directly through the hotel you want to see the show at. I will never purchase tickets through this company again.",0
962,"Have been coming to mc's forever. Usually for pie. Food, aside from the potato cheese soup and cornbread are kinda bleh. This location is and has been pretty horribly managed for a long time now. Have been waiting for 20 minutes now for my pie and am watching the young kids working the front totally screw up most the transactions. One girl just shorted someone their change and another kid forgot to fully charge another. Forgetting to seat people, forgetting items on pick up orders etc. If I ever feel the need for pie again I will just go to another location.",0
963,"I wasn't overly impressed. We came here a few months ago on one of our first kid-free dates in a long time. I had a turkey club type sandwich with iced tea and my boyfriend had a philly cheese-steak type sandwich. I'm sure it would be more helpful if I knew exactly what we ordered, but the meal was that lackluster. Service was incredibly slow and I didn't get a single refill on my tea until we were already done eating. We weren't ready to order the first time the server appeared (first visit) and asked him to give us a few minutes. It took probably 15 minutes before he came back to take our order, even though our menus were closed and sitting on the table. It also took quite some time to get our check. We sat on the patio and it was quite nice out there. The food was okay, I should have ordered something else. The menu is pretty limited (although that may have changed in the last few months) and the food was just \""""meh\"""".\n\nI really want to support local restaurants like this, and will likely give them another chance.",0

The person at the front of Ghostbar told us that if we chose to use our VIP bracelets, then we would get two free drinks. When we went up to the bar, the bartender told us that we did not get free drinks. It did not ruin my night, but if we knew we weren't going to get any perks from the VIP bracelets, we would have used them at another place. \n\nThis place is having an identity crisis. Are you a lounge or a club?",1
965,"I really wanted to love Upstream, but it totally fell flat. We sat in the bar for some apps and drinks after a movie, and it was one disappointment after the next. The biggest disappointment of all was the management (and this is speaking from two people who worked and lived off of tips in the service industry for years). We weren't looking for anything but an acknowledgment and somehow felt like we were the ones causing problems.....so what happened...\n\nWe ordered shrimp dumplings and they came out raw. We sent them back and somehow were left to feel like we were being unreasonable. Call me crazy, but expect food to be cooked and want to make sure there are no risks to eating said food. New ones came out (they were great) but TOTALLY different than first ones of which the management said were \""""slightly undercooked\"""" and he was \""""trained that most food was sushi grade.\"""" Call me crazy again, but just admit the mistake and we all feel good. \n\nLastly the bill came and Upstream has the audacity to charge $3.50 an oyster for Wellfleets ($42/dozen). Whaaaat!! I'm a Boston gal who knows her seafood. Never in my life have I seen someone charge that amount. Nevermind that the menu says they are $2.50 but they all of a sudden claimed it was a premium oyster at a different price.\n\nI can forgive mishaps and mistakes - it happens to the best of us. I cannot accept management who is so cavalier and dismissing to their guests.\n\nPrices are high here and that is no issue for me for great food and service, however not acceptable if you can't deliver on those fronts.",0
966,"We stopped by the Deacon's House for some breakfast (and to get out of the rain).  The two of us went for the standard breakfast which was mediocre.  Its hard to screw up some eggs and bacon and sausage but they gave it a good go!  The eggs were scrambled but seemed like they were sat in a puddle of water!  The food was edible, but only just.  I don't know what it is but it was hard to find a decent breakfast in Edinburgh!\n\nI did however like the coffee and also the cafe itself, which used to be the workshop of the Deacon (who's real name I have forgotten) and the story behind this guy.  Although a respected cabinetmaker, he was also a thief and he and his friend and co-crook were hanged on gallows that the cabinetmaker built!

967,"I recently became an \""""mlife\"""" member.  Mlife is the rewards program for gambling, staying and eating at all the MGM-owned properties (Mandalay Bay, MGM, Bellagio, Aria, etc).  I down-loaded the mlife app to my iPhone and under the section called \""""promotions\"""" I see the \""""two for one\"""" drink special at Fleur.  It clearly states the happy hour special runs from 3pm to 6:30pm.  It was 5:45pm and off we went to indulge!  I pull my phone out and show the waitress as we order.  She knows nothing about mlife or the special and gets a manager who tells me I have to go to the mlife desk in the casino to get a voucher.  We order the drinks and I leave my husband in Fleur to go get the voucher.  They mlife desk tells me there is no such voucher and that the Fleur employees need to honor the special that is on the app.  Ok, I go back and finish my now-melted drink.  It's 6:08pm as we order another round.  The waitress tells us that happy hour ended at 6pm so the drinks will now be full price.  Again I pull out my app and show her that the special runs until 6:30pm.  The manager comes back over and says it's all taken care of.  Ok, GREAT!!!  We finish our drinks and the bill comes...the second round at full price.  O. M. G.   I went back to the mlife desk and asked them to fix it, which they did.  \n\nHere's my beef:   Fleur, if you are going to run an mlife special please tell your employees so that your customers don't feel like criminals for following the rules.  We were plain and simply responding to a marketing promotion that you/your company put out.  We weren't asking for any exceptions to be made or special treatment and we weren't being cheap.

968,"Ohhh I wanted to like it! We live in Henderson, so it took a lot to convince my roommate to drive the 30 miles one way -- I had to offer to pay LOL so off we went. I ordered NY Street Dog, waffle fries & BBQ Western Burger w/bacon. I have to admit when the food got to the table, in the cute little bar style baskets -- I turned to my roommate and said \""""disgusting\"""". It was so gross, to me (and I'm from the west coast) but it was all Chicago style -- like a mess. It wasn't the type of food you can just pick up and eat, the bun - from both the hot dog and the burger were just saturated, wet, soggy, mushy like dough like gross - which is where my \""""disgusting\"""" game from. So the hotdog was some type of pressed meat type of hot-dog, like a cheap hot dog and it was not grilled. It was not a good, high quality hot dog at all. What I didn't like was it was all pink - inside and out I don't know I like my hotdogs grilled with like grill marks on the outside. This dog sat down in the soggy bun covered with sour croute and mustard. I bit off the one end and pushed the hotdog over to my roommate. He cut his burger in half and gave me half - same thing, and I wanted to take a picture but I felt silly - it was a big piece of mush. Seriously like \u00be of it had been dipped in BBQ sauce........... It seems like the BBQ burger had some kind chili on it or something but it was all over saturated with BBQ/Chili sauce. I took a bite, the burger itself seemed like a good burger - and I did like the actual meat of the burger itself but as the BBQ sauce got all over my hands and fingers it was a mess, yucky - I set the rest of the burger in its basket and pushed it away. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. Oh ya and they were out of waffle fries - so we opted for the \""""natural\"""" fries, which ya, were very greasy. We ate all of the fries, because we were hungry and both of us not too happy with the meals - the little sauces that came with the fries was good  some kind of Cajun sauce and what seemed to be tarter.\n\nLike I said I wanted to like this place, I like the d\u00e9cor and the waitress was very nice but this place is not my style. I'll continue on my personal search for a great Las Vegas burger.",0

Cheapest option, right? Wrong. So very very wrong. Unfortunately I dropped by an hour before closing so I'm guessing I was rushed out while they were closing shop. They either never checked the air coming out of my vents for themselves or they KNEW they were ripping me off $150.

975,I visited their location in Arizona Mills Mall and the service was ridiculous. I stood in line for 5 minutes waiting for someone to even take my order then after that I stood in line another 10 minutes waiting to check out and pay for my food. Needless to say I became so annoyed and upset by the slowfulness they demonstrated with their customers that I happily gave them back their slice of pizza and told them that they could have it because I no longer wanted it. So if you desire to wait in line and then wait in line some more just to eat at what is suppose to be fast food then I suggest you visit this place.

986,"Besos review\n\nBeso's is a very nice place though a tad bit noisy when full. We like many reviewers here used an $79 Travelzoo voucher for a dinner supposedly worth $200. if you have one of these be prepared to be treated like a 2nd class customer. They seem to look down on you just because you are trying to get a deal on a dinner actually worth about price of voucher. Standard drinks from the bar are $14 each so keep that in mind before ordering.\n\nBecause of voucher, you can only chose select items on the menu. The crab cake appetizer was not bad. The sides mac and cheese and green beans we average at best. The main entre, 8oz steak filet was cooked perfectly and tasty. The champaign was not very good. I would say this steak dinner was not even close to worth $200 and barely worth the price of the $79 Travelzoo voucher. I have had better steaks and sides at The Outback for 1/4 the price. Also it was dinner for 2, but they automatically added $30 gratuity based on value of dinner, $198, so that was odd because service was not that good and food not worth the price.\n\nI will complain to Travelzoo.\n\nPro's:\n- nice place\n- decent service\n- good steak\n\nCon's:\n- $30 gratuity automatically added\n- average food at best\n- rude staff\n- Eve club passes were supposed to be included but Eve went bankrupt 3 days ago.\n- pricy average bar drinks",0
987,"the worse place I have ever been to. It is located inside a run down gas station. The place has a feel of Texas chainsaw massacre.  Inside, the place was equally horrific as the outside. There is no way I would send my dog there ever again.",0
988,"HAHA! The name is clearly amusing on its own and so was the show itself. Perfect for a ladie's night out. I'm personally not a fan of these type of shows but when you're in Vegas, why not? Actually, it's a lot 'classier' than the one I went to in NYC for a bachelorette party so if I were to choose, I would go back to this one. The show is held at a small theater in the Excalibur hotel and everyone is seated in rows of tables. The bar is in the back of the theater so make sure you bring enough cash to tip the bartender. Personal cameras are not allowed but you can take a Polaroid shot with your favorite Aussie boys at the end of the show by one of their own cameraman.   For me, a once in a blue moon experience is enough.",1

991,"Chick-fil-a is comfort fast food for me. I love the original chicken sandwich; I add 1 pack of honey mustard. I grab a second honey mustard packet for dipping my delicious waffle fries - which, unfortunately, they sometimes skimp on, in my opinion. \n\nI have to tell you, though, I witnessed the talent of the best balloon artist I've ever seen at this location! (He's not there every week, but you'll find him there on some Wednesday afternoons for the whole \""""kids eat free\"""" thing.) I was so mesmerized, as I waited in line to order and then for my food,  that I hardly noticed the wait and the fact that the place was overrun with little ones didn't detract from my experience! Chick-fil-a actually caters to the whole family thing really well. (And, their kids' meals have educational toys, often promoting literacy).",1
992,"I tried my first class two days ago and it was amazing. I was sold. They welcomed me right away and they have lots of equipment (bolsters, straps, blankets etc). What I really liked about this place is they offered water and a mat rental without charging unlike most places. The instructor was kind and helpful. Also the studio is well maintained and clean. \n\nI pre purchased a 5 class pass that day. Much to my dismay the very next morning a Groupon for a much better deal popped up. It was for first time students only. Technically, I was no longer a first time student. I emailed the owner and she was awesome about it! She let me cancel my original purchase and get the Groupon deal instead. I have a feeling I am going to become a long time member of this studio due to its wonderful business ethic and awesome classes.",1

994,"I had the distinct pleasure of making the acquaintance of the King of our fair city earlier this week. At his behest, we met up at The Skeptical Chymist.\n\nAt first glance, I was nervous that the venue would be incredibly small. It's tucked away in the corner of a shopping center, between a sandwich shop and a Rubio's. The storefront is immensely wide, but for some reason, it didn't appear that it would be very spacious inside.\n\nTo say that I was wrong would be putting it lightly. When I walked up to the \""""Please Seat Yourself\"""" sign where a hostess might stand during peak hours, I was immediately lost. There was a vast section in the center of the bar that was teeming with people there to enjoy the amazing happy hour specials (from 4:00 pm - 7:00 pm). I had to actually walk around to the right side of this group (through a small seated dining section) to reach the bar.\n\nI only had a moment to gaze at the bar while waiting for Scott D. to arrive. In that time, I noticed several different beers with which I am, sadly, not yet familiar. Though, after the night I enjoyed, I'm sure we will not be strangers for very long.\n\nWhen Scott D. arrived, we ordered a nice stout beer (I'm ashamed to say that I was too nervous to pay attention to the name of the ale). Scott said that it's a good idea to \""""start from the left, and work your way to the right\"""" of the beers on tap. On this night, we never made it past the first tap.\n\nWe picked up our ales, and headed to the outdoor patio (another pleasant surprise).  The patio was surrounded by misters, which I'm sure, offer great relief during the blistering summer months. There was a television in the corner of the patio that was airing the Thursday night NFL game. There was a walk up bar that connected to the bar in the main room. \n\nAt first, it appeared that we got lost in the mix, as it took a while before a waiter came around to see how we were doing. But, once they realized their mistake, they were exceptionally quick to rectify the situation. Our server, whose name escapes me, was incredibly courteous and apologetic for the delay. He asked if we were interested in appetizers...which, after the strong ale, we absolutely were!\n\nScott recommended the \""""Pulled Pork Sliders\"""". Perhaps it was the beer, perhaps it was the situation. But the sliders were great! They come four to a plate (perfect for sharing). And since it was happy hour, we got them at half price ($5.00).\n\nAs the night progressed, there was another round of the same beer. That, subsequently, led to another appetizer. For this round, Scott suggested the Chicken Tenders. Being happy hour, we only paid $4.50 for this dish. Just like before, this dish comes with four chicken tenders, making for another easy mathematical conclusion as to which way the dish should be split. I know they were chicken, but the manner in which these tenders are fried, they reminded me more of fried fish. Whatever the case may be, they were scrumptious.\n\nCue the third round of beers, again from the same tap. (Now I HAVE to return, just so I can figure out what this beer is called!) \n\nWe sat, we drank, we ate, and we were merry. We ended up chatting for more than three hours over drinks and bar fare. So, if you were paying attention, you know that we each had three stout ales and two delicious appetizers during our little pow wow. \n\nBy the time the tab came, I had completely forgotten that we had been drinking and dining on Happy Hour prices. The damage was an astounding $40.00...including a generous tip! \n\nAs we exited the bar (three plus hours later), it dawned on me that there was a stage upon which live music acts performed! This place is WAY bigger than I had originally though!  \n\nAnd did I mention the \""""Library\""""? I fear I may have said too much already...perhaps when I return, I'll venture into the rest of the nooks and crannies of this local gem!\n\nThat wraps it up for my 50th review. I know, to some, 50 reviews isn't an impressive milestone. But, to me, this one was special. And, after all, everybody has to start somewhere!\n\nI hope you enjoy both the review and the venue!",1
995,"For a vegas eatery on the strip, this place is an amazing find. 5.99 sandwiches that I would buy anywhere, they are that good. It's open 24/7 and is the perfect stop at 4 or 5 in the morning when you need some nutrients to go with the booze.",1
996,"From the previous review I thought I was just getting a foot massage with a head, neck, and shoulder massage. Instead I got a complete massage from head to toe. Though it was one of the best massages I've ever had, she only spent about  5-10 out of 60 minutes on my feet. I had just had a regular massage the day before and had aching feet from going out dancing the night before, so I was primarily there to get my feet worked on. If she had even spent another 5 minutes on my feet it would have been a 5 star review. Still it was an amazing massage and I left feeling totally relaxed and fairly blissful. The recliner chairs are extremely comfortable. She changed the back on the chair and had me flip over, the new back had a face hole in it like a regular massage table, but it was infinitely more comfortable than a standard massage table. The dim lightly, pleasant decor, and soft music all added to putting me into a relaxed state. Next time I'm going for the 90 minute massage so there's plenty of time for the feet and everything else.",1
997,"My husband and I had a wonderful dinner here while visiting Montreal. It is hidden away on a side street; an escape from the hubbub of St Denis. The food was gorgeous - delicious, beautiful, innovative and very inexpensive for what it is. The space is cozy and pretty with just a few tables. The chef is a true artist and the waiter struck the ideal balance between being unobtrusive and attentive. It's a real gem. My favorite meal in Montreal.",1
998,"My boyfriend and I entered bachi burger with the thought of exotic flavors and delicious high-quality beef. Though the beef may have been exceptional, we both were disappointed with how overpowering the flavors were of everything else other than the beef. Cooked perfectly at medium, we would have liked the burger to not be completely overshadowed by what was an addition to it. \n\nHe got the Miyagi-San burger which tasted more like sushi than it did hamburger (and I took a bite of it!) I got the Ronin burger where I thought the Katsu BBQ sauce was way too sweet and made it hard to keep eating.\n\nCall me \""""old-fashioned\"""" or \""""all-American\"""" but I'll take a Great Burger where I taste the beef before these two options any day, \n\nFor $40 + dollars, we had two burgers, two sides of fries, a beer and a green tea. I hoped to actually enjoy my meal rather than us question to one another whether the burgers were worth even worth eating. \n\nWe found more enjoyment giggling over the green sunglasses with no lenses, neon orange shirt wearing hipster next to us than our food. I was so excited about this place. But it just wasn't good, in our opinion.\n\nWait... the fries were good! Two stars.",0
999,"I normally receive excellent and speedy service at this walgreens. However, the last time that I was in I was treated very rudely and tsk'ed for doing something outside of the store that was none of the employee's business. Yes, he literally said \""""tsk tsk.\""""  I was so upset that I came home and told my husband who immediately called the store manager to discuss the employee's interaction with me. \n\nI hope that this was an isolated incident because I've never had a single issue in this well maintained store.",0
1000,"I was so hopeful we found a new place that we could frequent...but our hopes were soon stomped on by over priced bland food.  I will say their caprese salad was good. \n\nMy husband had the baked goat cheese that came out 8 minutes after my salad & was burned...as soon as the server dropped off his appetizer she said that our dinners were up & asked if she should just bring them out.  We asked that she wait so he could eat his appetizer, a few minutes later our dinner was on the table & we were not even half done with our first course.  \n\nHe ordered the meatloaf & was unimpressed and thought it was pre-made from sysco, his green beans were nuked to death and were the texture of old shoe leather.  I ordered the Mac & cheese. I figured the $8  price tag would yield a high end very good dish.  Well, kraft deluxe is not the worst thing, but I did not expect that from a restaurant.  Masteros & Flemings serve theirs for $5 and are both very good Mac & cheese dishes.  Basically I felt a little robbed by the entire meal. Total for the meal was $76.00 which included a $34 bottle of wine.\n\nWe are sad to say that we won't be back unless we hear things have improved.  The design of the restaurant was wonderful...but they need to figure out their food & service or it will be just more empty commercial space in the valley.",0
1001,"Was looking for a restaurant near Boca Park where we could eat outside, and found this on google maps.  Saw the 4-star yelp review, and decided to check it out.\n\nWe arrive, and our waiter, Diego, was definitely an Italian immigrant -- immediate street-cred.   We proceeded to completely over-order and pretty much everything was excellent. We all enjoyed the bruschetta mix, cheese plate and prosciutto (all pronounced very precisely by Diego).  For mains, we got the monkfish picatta, the pappardelle, the chicken thighs, the roman gnocchi, and a pizza.  We polished it all off.  We topped it off with the chocolate dessert platter, which probably put me over the edge fullness-wise but just to the brim with deliciousness.",1
1002,"I had brunch here last Sunday and I would have to say that the Rib-eye steak was awesome.

They should write a book called \""""Friendly 101\"""" and then make every business read it.\n\nSince this is my new hood and I fly by it every day on 7th Street, I popped in to see if I could make an appointment.

We went with some lighter tone highlights (hello Summer) and a gloss to help ward off the red (go away brassy). Chelsea is fairly new to Charlotte. She moved here when her fiancee took on a new job here. She is just fantastic. I wouldn't be surprised if her old customers drive all the way to the Queen City to keep her as a stylist.\n\nBonus: I mentioned how I have been wanting to try a wand, but was a little scared. She took the time to show me how to use one. Gave me some great tips, advice and instruction. (Tune in next week when I'll be writing about burning myself)\n\nIf you are looking for a stylist, I definitely recommend Chelsea. I absolutely love my color and everything she did. Chelsea gets five stars! Cost-wise, it's not in my budget to come here on the regular. But hey, you get what you pay for.. right? For some people, probably not an issue. \n\nThere's more than just hair styling at Shine Salon.

I don't know when I think Mexican and I think Carribean cuisine i think loud bold flavours.

Can't go wrong with that!  \n\nOnly complaint - it can get pretty busy so there can be a wait occasionally.  One time I went, the car behind me bumped me while going through the wash.  I told an employee my concerns, and he gave me 50% off my next wash.  Wasn't too happy about it, but there weren't any scratches either and I've been here dozens of other times with no issues.  Watch the distance between you and the car ahead or behind you though.",1

We went back the second time and she remembered our orders and was quick to bring it!  Happy Hour ROCKS from 4 to 7 with half off of EVERY DRINK.  Yes...

1010,"Staff just seem burnt out. \n\nThe customer service is really lacking. They really have no concern in their customer loyalty or keeping customers coming back. \n\nThe facility is sometimes clean, and sometimes not. The water last week looked disgusting, it looked \""""thick\"""", I can't describe it any other way. The play area toys are grimy, more often than not.\n\nBut I decided to write a review after this experience:\n\nThey were using our instructor during our 30minute private lesson to train new staff. He spent most of the time talking to this new staff about how to instruct. When we said something to the staff after about 10 minutes, 1/3 of this lesson, was already wasted. Then, it took a few minutes to sort it out. Now we'd wasted 15 minutes of a 30 minute lesson. This was the first lesson since we have been back where my son was back to being comfortable and attentive in the water and it was wasted on training their own staff. He was off jumping around on the platform and playing. He basically got a 10 minute lesson because they usually play with water toys the last 5min, as a reward for listening. The playing is fine. But I am not okay with spending $42 on a 10 minute lesson. I would also have preferred that they informed me of the training in advance, as I would have known there would be wasted time and then would have rescheduled my lesson....sneaky sneaky bad customer service.\n\nThe worst part? When the staff started scrambling around after we informed them about the lack of attention during our private lesson...we asked that he stop training during our lesson...the person I am assuming is a manager or owner came out of the office and once she heard what was going on, she hid in the back offices and did not say anything to us. I mean, a manager should have AT LEAST apologized on behalf of the business and the RIGHT thing to would have been to reschedule us for a new lesson. Nope, nothing.\n\nOur instructor is good, Adam, which is why we return. And we have now signed up for a bunch of lessons coming up so we will see that through. We are looking for a new school after that.",0
1011,"We go there as a family all the time because the food is wonderful and it's very close. However, there is a particular Hostess/Waitress that refuses to take my order (but acknowledges the rest of my family members) and then brings me the wrong dish that I did not order and does not try to correct it in any way. She does not bring plates and my husband has to go up to the sushi bar and request plates to eat with all most every time. Great food but the horrible service makes it almost dreadful to eat there. If my family didn't love it and it was blocks from my home, I would pass on eating there.",0
1012,"I have a very entertaining experience at the Sushi Room that I will gladly tell while keeping names private (so as to not piss anyone off). Note that this is a whiiiiiileee back so I don't know if their staff is still the same. Phew\n\nSo my date and I show up really late on a Thursday night. The place is essentially empty except for a couple of people at the bar. We order a couple sake bombs, 2 rolls (spicy tuna and a salmon roll) and some korean-style ribs. The sushi was pretty tasty (very standard, nothing out of the world) but the ribs were pretty hard to eat with the chopsticks and had a bit of fat. Still, it was decent appetizers and HH pricing at night, so we were pretty complaisant with our choices. They had a couple choices of sake which I appreciated, so we went with the drier (less sweet) option. With HH prices, it ended up being about $25 for the both of us. Pretty darn good. \n\nHalfway through our meal we notice that we are the only ones left there and that the staff is busting up the volume (90's rap) and dancing to it. Don't get me wrong, it was freaking hilarious. Then, another staff member (not our actual server) invited my date and I next door to the Living room, where she proceeded to tell us her life stories and flirt with all the owners. (Sushi & Living Room are owned by the same group of people). Needless to say we had a great time, but it was all incredibly random. Their staff was fun. They kept it moderately professional while we were eating and enjoying our alone time... then let it all loose when their shift was over and we had paid our bill. Lol. What can I say, I love the restaurant life.",1
1013,"Excellent food, attentive service,very reasonable prices. What's not to like? Well, the table at which we were seated needed a bit of attention to its cleanliness. Otherwise I would have seriously considered five stars. But that was minor; I'll be back at first opportunity.",1
1014,"Visited Rachel's for the first time ever on 1-16-2013 for breakfast with my wife.  Service was not the best, in fact, counter girl had somewhat of an attitude.  Ordered a burrito and a wrap.  When the food came, my wife asked for extra salsa and the same counter girl only offered us hot sauce.  So much for that...so the food to our taste was a little dry.  I was surprised to find Scotch tape on the paper wrapper on my wrap.  All the serving cups are advertising franchise opportunities...a little tacky I thought.  Next time they might be advertising for a lawyer...Need a Check?\n\nAll in all, ok.  I would much rather go to Jamms or Babycakes.",0
1015,So... where do I start?\n\nCame here 2 nights ago... with a bunch of guys of course.\nThey all had beers... me on the other hand... well I don't drink... which leads to me to review on the food and service.\n\nI ordered one of their wraps... it took over 30 mins to arrive after placing my order. Why did it take that long to get to me? My friends said they messed up on my order... oh and the worst part after the long wait... It didn't have any flavor and the taste was horrible! I had wedges with my wrap... and that was decent. \n\nI suggest only coming here if you're a guy looking for a casual sports bar to have drinks with friends... and don't order any of the food items. My other friend ordered a chicken sandwich and it looked really scary... he didn't want to eat it but he was really hungry.  My other friend ordered the nachos... from my view... it looked really cheap and horrible. No good quality here when it comes to food.\n\nParking wasn't a problem. Seating wasn't a problem. Very casual. \n\nI would never be caught in a BWW again... first and last visit for me. Can't believe I spent 2 hours in here. yuck.\n\nNEXT.,0
1016,"HACKS! Be careful if you have a food allergy and you eat here!!!! I had one of their Grandma Blacks cookies which was loaded with walnuts, which I am allergic to. After eating the cookie I went into anaphylactic shock and was hospitalized for three days. There was NO mention anywhere in this restaurant on Baseline road of walnuts being used in any of their products. Not on the menus, not on the website, not on the damn wrapper for the cookie.\nWhen I approached the owner Terry Black about getting partial compensation for the thousands of dollars of hospital bills, I was met with little sympathy. Not even an apology. I can understand the owner not wanting to fork out the dough, and I even understand that there is no hard law in AZ that states you have to list allergens on your food products. But in this age of information, business ethics and customer service is everything and unfortunately this establishment LACKS just that. Years later and they still don't have any sort of allergy warnings on their menus or website. The day after my incident, the counter girl put a hand written note on the cookie jar that said 'may contain nuts'. That note was on for a day, tops! I am no longer a customer. These guys are poor excuses for restauranteurs. Stay away! Your life may depend on it if you have a food allergy.",0
1017,"So on an unexpecting Friday night bar hopping expedition, our final stop was Next Door Brewing. I've been wanting to try Next Door since before I actually moved here, so I was excited we were stopping here for our last drink. \n\nNow coming from what is voted as Beer City ( Grand Rapids ) I have a love for brewing companies.. I don't think that there is one that I wouldn't like.  I'm happy that I can now check Next Door Brewing off the \""""Brewing Companies to go to in Madison\"""" list. \n\nI liked how open it is here, and the huge tables are very ideal for bigger parties I would imagine. The beer list looked fantastic, as well as the menu. We ended up getting the Cheese Curds and the Chips and Guac, both great.. the sauce that comes with the cheese curds is fantastic! And the service was pretty good as well. I will say that the interior is a bit blah and basic I guess. Nothing really stood out for me. But I will definitely be back in and drink up some amazing brews!",1
1018,Love it. Near my house and always end up going here twice a month for dinner on my way back from my shop. Its fast its easy and the flavors are spot on. I normally get the spicy eggplant 6* rating. My wife will get the prik king or the chicken fried rice. The spice eggplant is done on point. There is no soggy about it. Other places over cook the eggplant and it tastes bad. This reminds me of being back home in Hawaii at a little thai shop there. The owner is a little thai lady who is very nice and laid back. I also like their curries. I haven't really tried much else other than the pad thai but really wasn't a fan of the way it was done.  either way good little thai joint to try out.,1
1019,"Pizza it's always good.  However this place really needs an update or refurbishment on booths.\n  And they had music playing overhead that was more annoying than anything; lots of static.\nMusic, static and kids tv noise doesn't work!\n\nLast but not least.  Guy that took my order had Attitude Attitude Attitude.",0
1020,"My, have times changed...\n\nOn a positive note, I can tell I'm maturing. I find myself having way less tolerance for bullshit and lames. TAO is the first club I went to when I turned 21 and I don't know if it's because I'm getting older or it was just way better three years ago, but TAO was just meh this time around. Don't get me wrong, the venue itself is fantastic. I love the decor and set up but apparently they will let just about anybody in. I mean, seriously, the group of girls in front of us were wearing flip flops.\n\nFLIP FLOPS!!? \n\nWho does that? \n\nIt baffles me that flip flops are allowed but men have to wear collar shirts and dress shoes. Luckily, we got in V.I.P. because if not, the guys would have had to pay for cover to an okay club and that would not have been the biznezz. Three stories with different music on each level. We headed straight to the balcony on the roof top where the pool was. This lounge area was very spacious and included many seats. I couldn't believe it was hot as hell even at 11 p.m. It was hard not to sweat just simply standing there. Grabbed beers and headed back down to the second floor. \n\nThis is where the low tolerance comes in. \n\nSure, the club was poppin' and people were dancing left and right but it was packed. TOO PACKED. I tried to get through to the other side of the bar and there were two girls freaking each other while two guys were behind the girls dry humping the shit out of them taking up the whole walking space. I haven't seen that ish since high school and I'd like to keep it like that. D\u00e9class\u00e9! Then, we tried to get into the main dance floor to party with other people. BIG MISTAKE. I almost made it to the center but had my four ppls stuck behind me. At that point, NOONE was moving. I told myself, \""""EFF IT.\"""" and started dancing until this guy's back was leaning on mine while he was dancing with some other chick as if I were the only thing holding them up. Another chick looked as if she was passing me and then stopped right next to me and stood there. WTF? Then, everyone trying to get into the main floor started pushing their way in so there go my elbows. Needless to say, I had enough. I headed out and found me a spot to dance my ass off to the same old repetitive crap - I won't say anything good about the music. Actually, it sucked balls. I am over \""""apple bottom jeans, boots with the fur\"""" as well was \""""put your, put your, put your hands up\"""" and \""""I'm goin, goin' back to back to cali caliiiii...\"""" After the day spent at Azure, I could tell I wasn't going to be too content about anything. \n\nI know I know, it's Vegas. What was I supposed to expect? Still though. \n\nEventually we peaced. I was on a good one and we decided to gamble our asses off since we barely spent anything so off to the blackjack table I went...",0
1021,"Uncomfortable seating was the first problem. \n\nDo not make the mistake of going here for lunch in the summer. The server we had remarked that this is when they train new chefs. And it was obvious.\n\nWife had a philly sandwich and it was tough.\n\nI ordered a Rib Steak. First one was over done. Second one was almost raw. I asked them to stop trying, and wasting good steak. \n\nThe manager picked up our tab, which was nice. He also gave me his business card to use for a free meal on a return trip.

1022,"Lil'porgies is great, I frequent every other Wednesday with my mentee from the CU one to program. Porgies is fast, you order and your eating.

1023,"These people are basically con artists. All they did was change the name on the sign. It's STILL the same crappy food and the same crappy people. The crappiest chinese place I've ever eaten at.

Probably my favorite Kona Grill location, and I love Mellow Mushroom Pizza! \nThe fro-yo place (Mojo)  is a little more unique than some of the cookie cutter fro-yo places around town. \nBlue Martini is a very fun place to go, and also very unique for Phoenix. If you like live music, this is your place!\nI love that it's not as pretentious as some places in Scottsdale, but still has a mature and classy atmosphere.\nNot really a place to \""""be seen\"""", but not everyone is looking for that anyway!\n\nGreat place for special occasions, or if you do happen to be fortunate enough to have a large budget for dining. \nThe shopping is a lack thereof, but there's no shortage of shopping in general anywhere in Phx.\n\nI can't believe no one mentioned the fact that the street is called High Street!",1
1025,"My husband and I ate at the Siamese Cat for the first time last night. I am very disappointed in all the dishes we ordered.\n\nWhen trying a new Thai restaurant for the first time, my husband I always get our favorite dishes. We ordered Laab Gai, chicken satay, phad kee Mao (drunken noodles) and phad bai kra prao. It's a lot of food but like most Asians, we like variety in our meal. \n\nThe satay came out first and it was ok. Nothing memorable- you could taste a hint of the curry power but not much. The peanut sauce was super oily. \n\nNext was the Laab - I had high hopes for this because it usually is always good everywhere I go but this dish was much too salty.\n\nThe noodle dish was the worst dish. The noodles were really hard.  I could tell they did not warm up the noodles enough before cooking it. Also, there was no flavor to this dish at all. A big disappointment as phad kee Mao is always flavorful with the sauce and basil. \n\nLastly the stirfry tasted nothing like what it should have tasted like. It was a typical stir fry and it was quite dry. \n\nOverall we phad 33 for everything so the food was cheap. The service is better than most Asian restaurants so we tipped our waitress well.  Sadly, we will not return because not one dish we ordered was anything near our expectations.",0
1026,"What a gem of a place in old town Scottsdale. Has it all from ambiance to service. They use as many local products as possible, great bruch sparkling wine selections. Prices are great and portions spot on. This place is must try, I will be going there again!",1
1027,"Sorry, Okada.  This time was so incredibly disappointing.  Well- maybe because we went to the teppanyaki part of the restaurant.  SO MEDIOCRE.  I was expecting much better since I had such a great experience last time.  \n\nSo totally overpriced (as expected in Vegas) for all the teppan dishes.  We ordered some sashimi on the side but it wasn't as fresh as I remembered from the prior year.  Sigh- I think Okada has gone down hill.",0
1028,"How do you start off a review when you're simply flabbergasted? Liberty Market has flabbergasted me. What a place. It is so unassuming from the street, almost leaving you wondering if you're in the right place, but then you walk through those doors and feel like you've been transported to some magical dream world. Here's a word of warning, I will be gushing until the end of this review. \n      I asked my dear Kristen to find us a new restaurant last night for dinner, and she, through a very unorthodox way, found us Liberty Market. I asked her if she was sure it was a restaurant and not a market, she said yes, and we were off. While driving over to Gilbert she let me know that the owner of Liberty Market was also the owner of Joe's BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill, this excited me to no end because those two places are wonders themselves, masterfully put together and designed, if I may say so myself, and Liberty Market is no different. \n      Sitting next to a fun water park of sorts (a great place for photography), it is set in beautiful downtown Gilbert, and right when we walked in the door we were greeted by every employee under the sun, it seemed even the chefs ran out from the kitchen to say hello. Now, this was not because it was slow, there were quite a few people there, not quite busy, but hopping for sure, they simply are awesome employees. The atmosphere here is incredible and the interior has a wonderful modern design, there is even a \""""market\"""" where you can purchase various drinks and old timey trinkets. The salad and bread chefs conversed with us and explained how the market worked, so we sat ourselves down, looked over a menu, and picked our delights for the night. \n      Kristen stuck with tea, while I had an Anchor Brewing \""""Liberty Ale\"""" as we began our meal sharing the starter pizza, a delicious, light, grilled flat bread with olive oil, pecorino romano, rosemary and hummus to dip it in. We were already hooked with just the starter. The bread was so good, warm and airy, the cheese had a perfect bite and the hummus was a perfect topper, nothing too heavy and nothing too lite, simply a delicious starter, leaving us ready for the next tasty morsel. I ordered the flatiron steak with chimichurri sauce, garlic smashed potatoes, and fresh from the ground grilled vegetables. The steak... oh boy, the steak... it was so flavorful, cooked perfectly, not tough at all, I'm having a hard time finding words to describe the deliciousness, it was just so good. The chimichurri sauce added a wonderful dimension, it was light but flavorful, never overpowering. I thought the potatoes were awesome, a great blend of big delicious fresh chunks of potato and small hunks of garlic, and the vegetables (carrots and asparagus) had a wonderful grilled taste that brought out their natural goodness. A truly special and wonderful dish. Kristen ordered the liberty bowl with pasta (essentially spaghetti and meatballs) and loved it. The meatballs were big and filling, wonderfully seasoned and cooked. The marinara sauce was done really well, tangy and rich with an intoxicating aroma and the noodles were tender yet had a good bite to them. I am by no means a pasta man, and I thought it was terrific. With every bite, we each were just overwhelmed with our plates. The food at Liberty Market seems to have been very well planned out with careful seasoning and incredible ingredients. \n      We will be back to Liberty Market, many many times. You simply have to try it, you will see what I mean, see why it's so special. Also, don't leave without visiting the restrooms, all of them, peek inside each one. I love cool restaurant bathrooms, and these are some of the best.",1
1029,Consistently good contemporary thai. Order in or get it to go. Favorites are the Noodle Hut Special spicy tom yum soup that I order w both chicken AND shrimp and the Glass Noodle Salad in that yummy lemon-lime sauce. \n\nEverything is fresh and made to order. Nice selection of hot teas too.\n\n The summer rolls are not very flavorful though - basically just bland vermicelli w a lot of lettuce and a hunk of shrimp in the Shrimp version. \n\nKids love chicken on a stick w/ side of white rice. Super nice wait staff too. Bathroom is tiny and clean.,1
1030,"This should be called the porn hotel.  Several of us were staying here for business.  We came to the conclusion over lunch that this is less than desirable for a business traveller hotel, unless you are a porn producer.\n\nFirst the entire hotel is dark!  Have they heard of 100 watt bulbs!   This is where ugly people go to screw.  \n\nThe rooms have the bed in the middle of the room.  This can be off putting to a business traveller.  But it allows for dramatic 360 degree views of the action.  Did I mention that the room was dark!!! Is makes it a challenge finding the bathroom in this goofy studio floor plan.  The closet is also hidden for those pornos that want to have the rapist waiting in the closet motif.\n\nDid I mention the music.  It is everywhere and loud!  It makes it difficult to have a conversation.  Oh yeah and it sounds like a porn soundtrack.\n\nThere are a few suggestions for improvement:  \n1.  All of the bell men should get 70s porn staches\n2.  They need the bell men to wear dress shirts unbuttoned to the navel over day old wife beaters.",0
1031,"I only eat one thing from dim sum carts, the steamed pork buns. These were ok, similar to the ones found in the frozen foods section at the supermarket. The food from the regular menu was nothing special either. For the price, I expected better.",0
1032,I am a Sephora Insider because I frequent Sephora all the time. I recently had my free makeover done by Heather and Yvette at Sephora. They did a fabulous job! It was so great! I don't usually like when people do my makeup since I am really fussy. They listened to exactly what I wanted and made me look flawless! I recommend getting all your beauty needs at Sephora!,1
1033,"This used to be my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix.  About a year ago my husband and I both became violently ill a few hours after eating there, and after reviewing what we ate in common determined it had to be the salsa.  So we stayed away until Sat. night when we decided to give it a try again.  The place has always been scary by its appearance but we were amazed how much it had run down in just a year.  Everything was dirty, from the floors on up, including the inch of grime covering all the crap hanging on the walls, which keeps them from really cleaning or putting a badly needed fresh coat of paint on the place.  There are holes in the booths with stuffing spilling out and there was a big smear of dried salsa on the mirror hanging right next to my head.  All very unappealing!  Add to that stale, tough tortilla chips, a very bland green chili burro and watered-down Margarita and I'm writing off an old favorite.   Unless you really like the dangerous feeling you get when you walk into a border town dive, stay away!",0
1034,I never made it to the food. Waitress walked past three times with an obvious hatred of her job.

Although he did fleck off some crumbs. I left.,0

1036,"We went to a Christmas Eve Dinner with the family and I was let down hard! The Cioppino that I ordered for $50 was far from average. I've had a great cioppino and was not even worthy being called cioppino. The broth was like it was out of a can and the seafood was fishy (not fresh), more like frozen crap. Let's just say the entire dinner was a 1 star rating. The bill was over $500 and for what? I expected so much better. A big let down!!!",0
1037,"Just checked out of this hell-hole hotel. Don't blame the staff for this mess, however...they were both friendly and helpful. The problem is that this place reeks of cheap. Yes there's a pricey Kartell Ghost Chair here and there, but other than that the negative reviews people have mentioned about the run-down conditions of this place are true. Think IKEA meets Howard Johnson's and you've got the idea.\n\nThey did upgrade us from our $300 king pool view room to an apartment...an enormous space with a separate living room, dining room, and three private terraces. But that only meant there was three times as much that needed to be gutted and re-done. Shame on you, Morgans Hotel Group, for misrepresenting this property. Next time I'll be staying at the Sanctuary at Camelback.",0
1038,I usually wouldn't make fun of retards but the people this place hires are total retards. Have no idea what they are doing. Run out of buns for sandwiches ? Really ? Total shit hole I can't wait til  this place disappears again.,0
1039,"Pizza was on point! Chewy crust, fresh mozzarella and delicious topping! Sausage & mushroom and vingole will not disappoint.

1040,"Munch a Sub makes me want to munch on a sub.\n\nWhat I am honestly a fan of is their breakfast menu. They offer good food at reasonable rates. The English muffin sausage with cheese is huge and the sausage is King of that meal. \n\nWhether you want to walk in or have delivery this place is a must. It is good, fresh and tasty food.\n\nYou can't go wrong with their roast beef sandwich, one of my favorites. You can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches.

1041,"I am sorry, I use to really like this place, in fact, every time I come to Vegas I usually stay at Palazzo so I always eat a meal here, I like their breakfast.\nThe reason for 2 star is for their retard and rude server, this guy give us NO service! maybe because we r 4 young Asian and he figure we won't tip him good? well after this kind of service he is definitely not getting any tip! Other people arrive later and got bread but this guy won't bring us any..wtf? \nWhen he bring out of paste, it is not hot! \nWhen we order drink, he didn't bring straw..

1042,"While several dishes were very good i.e. falafel and hummus, twice we have been burned by entrees.

Oh, yes it was asparagus soup! The bread is amazing dunked into any of their homemade concoctions. Makes me all warm and fuzzy inside! \n\nGreat spot for a business lunch apparently. The last time I was there, it was full of patrons pouring over their paper documents and laptops keys ticking away. I felt a little left out, but Kaleb and I had our own business to attend to.........filling the belly!",1
1045,"WHAT?????????  There are many mysteries in life, but  none as inexplicable as this.  Why is there a line outside this place?  Why did the concierge at the Intercontinental urge me to come here?  I just don't understand.  I don't even care that the place looks like a dump of a diner.  That's fine.  It's a cheap meal.  But come on!  The \""""legendary\"""" smoked brisket that they serve is TERRIBLE!!!!  The \""""home made\"""" fries suck!  I mean, there is nothing good about them.  Anyone can but potatos and fry them.  They do nothing to them.  No flavor.  Just blah.  And back to those sandwiches.... what are you people raving about.  Have you guys had a decent sandwhich anywhere? They suck. They are plain bad.  Sure they age and smoke the beef for days, but who cares.  They slap it on boring rhye bread with some cheap mustard.  The beef is just boring.  If I smoke something for 10 hours, you better believe it's going to be one of the most delicious things you've ever tasted.  This was just bad.  We weren't that hungry, so we told the waiter to just bring us one.  He chuckled and said, once you try it, you're gonna want another one because they are small sandwhiches and they are the best.  I insisted on just one to share and we were both very pleased with our decision.  Neither of us finished our piece.  We ran out of there as fast as we could... confused and disoriented as we passed the 30 people waiting in the line outside.  As we walked down the street, we overheard a group of people talking about the place.  They were locals... all were wondering what the big deal was about this place.  I started a conversation with them and we were all in agreement.  Anyway, Montreal is a wonderful place to eat.  Don't waste one of your meals here.  Wow...",0
1046,Michaels is awesome.  I prefer their custard over Culvers though I still frequent Culvers as well for that but Michaels burgers and fries are head and shoulders above Culvers in taste.  Their rootbeer is also better than Culvers and so is the cheese curds so I'm beginning to wonder why I ever even go to Culvers.,1
1047,"So far, I have only come in here for breakfast, but I have loved everything I'ved tried! This place is right by the gym so the location is very convenient. I've gotten the oatmeal with bananas, cinnamon, raisins. The mulitgrain protein pancakes and granola french toast have to be my favorites. I loved the turkey sausage and egg whites. The portions are pretty big, which I like because I can share with someone or take the rest home. I love the Berry Blast smoothie which is nice when I'm on the go and can't sit down to eat. I can stop in and just grab a smoothie. I have been here quite a few times and I notice that sometimes the food can take about 15-20 minutes to come out, even when I only have one entree for myself. Other than that, the staff is very nice, the place is clean, and the food is tasty!",1
1048,"Where do I even begin...\n\nI'll keep this review minimal, as you should waste none of your precious time or money thinking about or being in this wretched place.\n\n*WAY outdated facilities\n*Needs a paint job\n*The vast majority of the tiles in the jacuzzi were missing - snagged my bathing suit\n*The jacuzzi was WAY too hot\n*The table that I received my sub-par treatment on was not heated\n*The shower in the treatment room that I was in was freezing cold\n*The shower head was broken in the treatment room\n*The staff was very loud when speaking to each other and customers\n*The Aquvana experience is a joke\n*The wave room and salt grotto are also a joke (glorified sauna)\n*The lights above the jacuzzi were dirty and filled with dead bugs\n*Bleach stains on towels\n\n...you get the point\n\nI've been waiting over 24 hours to speak with a manager who just now called and reluctantly gave me and my friend a full refund.

1049,"What a disappointment...the most over-priced, terrible dining experience I've had in Charlotte. Took 15 minutes to have drink orders taken. After that, the poor performance continued. The calamari was way over-salted!!! Awful. The sushi was sub-par at best. The fish was pretty fresh, but the rolls were simplistic and lacked flavor. Considering the specialty rolls range from 10-22 dollars, I expected a lot more. Ru San's is a much better choice if you are looking for sushi. The only good thing about the meal was that our waiter had the calamari removed from the bill because he agreed that it was way too salty as he had seen the chef season it. Even with that off the bill, way over-priced! Save yourself the time and do not dine here. The staff and customers at Enso are too worried about being hip to provide a decent experience.",0
1050,"I am extremely disappointed! I was surprised at how fast they were done and after doing a quick walk around my car I pointed out numerous areas missed. It was as if he never wiped down the outside! It was so ridiculous and I was so aggravated that I said \""""Whatever, forget it\"""" then tipped the bare minimum and left. I will not go back.",0
1051,Sorry Nacho Daddy but I'm giving ya 1 star. I've never walked out on a restaurants before ordering but we were not impressed by the atmosphere or the lack of mexican dishes offered. We were craving tacos and were disappointed to see only one dish on the menu. I know each restuarant has there own complimentary snacks brought to the table like bread or chips and salsa but here you give jalepeno corn bread muffins and sadly they weren't cooked all the way and were so tiny. I'm sorry that this wasn't a better experience for us.,0
1052,"I finally made it to Pure Pizza recently and was impressed by the quality of the pie they're serving up! I ordered my pizza from the chalkboard above the cash register with a little help from the guy who took my order. He helped me to decide which crust and even sauce that was to go on my pizza. I decided on a 3-Cheese pizza on traditional crust with a \""""special sauce\"""". It was de-lish! My pizza was brought right to me as I waited at a small table in the 7th st market nearby. The gentleman who brought my pizza even asked me if I needed anything else, although I'm sure he didn't have to. The 7th St. Market seems to be very much self-serve. \n\nIf I'm craving a personal pizza in uptown in the future, I'll be sure to return to Pure Pizza and try another yummy pie. Keep up the good work, guys!",1
1053,"LOVED this place! Low key, chill hangout spot. My favorite part was the mini bar where you are served by midget a bartender. There is an old school juke box in the corner that has a huge selection of old and new hits. There is huge tree swing at the main bar, tins of huge adult drunken games, too many too list/describe. I recomend just getting your booty down there and enjoy yourself! This bar is great for the active, fun adventure seeking type of drunken night!: )",1

1056,"I WILL never come to this one again. Customer service sucks. The blonde girl who looked like a mabager wasnt even paying attention to handing us our food. She was busy talking to someone else while handing us our food. The food was BEYOND cold. Just never again, waste of my money!!!!!",0
1057,"The Kitchener Delta is a classic case of bait n' switch. Their web site shows you pictures of their updated lobby, their bar area and their neon-blue swimming pool housed under a brightly lit atrium. All of this is true, but once you get past the lobby your experience goes steadily downward. \n\nWhile the bathroom of my room had been remodeled and was clean, the room hadn't been updated in ages. To be fair, the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable, but the finishings like the furniture and the carpets were well worn. The lamp shades are faded yellow and the televisions are older, small tube units.\n\nAlso, my room on the second floor was very, very loud. You can hear the traffic below through the double-paned windows. \n\nThe restaurant in the hotel is pretty run down. Even though their \""""buffet\"""" breakfast is free, it's well worth paying for something nicer on your own at a local restaurant. \n\nDon't be fooled by their \""""fitness center\"""" either. It's a bunch of run down equipment in a basement that smells pretty funky/musty. \n\nThe price was reasonable, but you really do get what you pay for. If you can afford $25-$50 more a night, I'm sure there are better places to stay. I hear the Radisson in Kitchener isn't so bad. Maybe that'll be my next stay/review.",0
1058,"This review is from an 18 year old/non-gambler perspective. Red Rock Casino Resort is one of the best hotels/casinos I've been to on and off the strip. It's very kid friendly with activities such as a movie theater, arcade, bowling alley, large pool, and for the younger kids Kids Quest, and a good food court.  I would have rated this 5 stars, but the curfew policy is a little bit ridiculous and inconsistently enforced. During my stay at Red Rock for most of the time i was with cousins around the age of 14-17 years old, and since i was the only one 18, I served as their  \""""guardian\"""" while away from their parents after 10:00 pm. Around this time you need to be 18 in order to buy food, I found this a bit odd after being carded to buy an banana split at Ben and Jerrys. Besides the ridiculous curfew, this is a great place to stay when taking your family to Las Vegas.",1
1059,I was so excited that Crab Corner opened on Rainbow and Sunset. I took my friend there for a belated birthday lunch as she is from Maryland and loves good crab. \n\nWe got seated at a table in the middle of the room - no biggie - except that the waiter mentioned that it is much warmer in this area. The restaurant was absolutely freezing! I had a sweater on but my friend had a light sweater and was miserable cold the whole time we were there. \n\nThe waiter was attentive except he had his cell phone out and was checking it in between talking to us which was very annoying. He was very informative and went into detail about the menu along with the specials. Both waiters were running non-stop but did check in with tables. We did not get a refill of our drinks which was disappointing.\n\nWe were served soup in Styrofoam bowls - REALLY! The soup was very good but we had to eat it quickly as it cooled off fast. The crab cakes we ordered were excellent with 1/3 pound of crab and was served on fun red plates. The homemade coleslaw was very good and definitely a great side. \n\nI would like to try the blue crab and other entrees but not until the place warms up!,0
1060,"In my previous review, I made the argument for Charcos in how they avoided the dreaded \""""drama plate\"""". I ordered something interesting and it managed to taste great without any sort of micro-management.\n\nAlas, I must step down a few paces from my previous praise, because the drama has creeped back in. What used to be gourmet chicken on a budget is now a roll of the dice.\n\nThe confidence from my first visit seems gone. Employees seem confused; not sure whether to charge up front or when the food is done. Or what goes on a particular sandwich. The wait time has doubled. The \""""wraps\"""" sometimes use burger buns instead of pitas. The fries sometimes come without that seasoning that worked so well. It's like a roll of the dice with your twenty dollar bill on the line.\n\nWhere is that Charcos we were first enthralled with? I hope it comes back soon, because I'm not sure it's worth being burned a third or fourth time by something on the production line.",0
1061,"This place was below average. Artichoke dip was ok, calamari was horrible. If you go wrong with calamari, then the restaurant has issues. It was pretty much just batter and no squid. My meatloaf was salty and edible but that's about it. The ravioli was under cook and bad. In general, everything including my mash potatoes was salty. My friend couldn't finish his meatloaf and left to eat Chinese food at the Venetian. Service was fine though but we left disappointed the plates averaged 20 bucks aside for steak items.",0
1062,"Our experience not so great.  We have mortgage as well as basic free checking and savings with Dollar in Squirrel Hill.  Mortgage application process was brutal.  Starting with the advertised rate of 2.85% being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it in; got 3.01%.  Automatic deduction of mortgage payment was required to secure this rate and it came out of the required Dollar checking account on the first business day of the month.  Free checking is free... until.  Beware of Funds Availability policy.  We deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.  In August, the end of the month was a weekend and Labor Day was on September 1.  So our check did not get deposited until 9/2.  Mortgage payment hit on 9/2. It was paid, but we were charged $36 insufficient funds due solely to Funds Availability Policy.  After doing this first, Dollar then merrily hits us with two more $36 charges on smaller checks that would have cleared had they been processed before the mortgage payment.  Had we NOT been required to submit to automatic deduction of mortgage, according to our monthly statement, we had at least 10 days grace to make the payment, so Dollar's requirements and policies trapped us into this situation.  Moreover, there was over $3000 in the associated savings account that was ignored.  I called to protest, and one of the $36 fees was waived.

Lunch appears to be pre-made and gets reheated once ordered.  Myself and the other customer ordered two completely different dishes and the cashier/cook/bossboy disappeared for what seemed to be the quickest 5 mins ever and came back with both dishes.  Suspicious much? Mine was super salty instead of the extra spiciness that I requested.  No I won't be coming back.",0
1065,"Being a member of the Edinburgh University Scandinavian Society, this Swedish cafe has been the venue for a couple of our events, and it's definitely appropriate, even down to it's decor of minimalist scandinavian design.\n\nI lived in Sweden for two years, so was increasingly surprised as I spotted one swedish speciality after another on the menu and at the counter! It's primarily a bakery, so all the delicious pastries and desserts I'd only found in Sweden were here, and in abundance as well; cinnamon buns and all sorts of muffins! They also sell a selection of sandwiches, and for those homesick Swedes, hand made crisp bread and jams imported from the land of the Vikings!\n\nOn the occasions I've been there for society get-togethers, there have been free for all waffles, served with ice cream, jam and cream... extremely messy but equally satisfying! And ofcourse a Swedish caf\u00e9 wouldn't be complete without an endless supply of coffee; seeing as I'm not particularly a fan, I'll give it a pass and say I've definitely had worse. \n\nPeter's yard is just off George Square, so a student favourite, and with outdoor seating, it's a glorious place to be when the Scottish weather decides to be generous!",1

1067,"I am not a fan of airport restaurants, and this place will not change that. The food and drinks are average. I really do not like the fact that this place is NOT kid friendly. This airport location was a connection for me and my family and during the layover; my wife and I ate here but I had to buy food at the next door Burger King and Sbarro for my three kids. It was cool that they allowed us to bring in this food (our server agreed they are not kid friendly) and that is good or otherwise we would have just walked out. It's not that my kids do not like Mexican food, there is only a chicken quesadilla that would qualify as kid-food and $13 is an outrageous price to pay for the size (yes airport food is always too high).\n\nI would come back here to eat...not a whole lot of other options without walking to another place in the airport....and no airport food is worth that.",0

It's a bit rich, but nothing beat their fall off the bone oxtail.  Perfect with rice. \n\n-Asparagus:  Grilled to perfection. I think I can eat two orders on my own.  \n\n-Bacon Wrapped Dates:  Pretty good.  Not sure what was better, the bacon or the dates.  Regardless, still tasty.  \n\n-Meatballs:  Not the best that I've had, but a good addition if you're looking to add some meat to your diet.  My opinion, the sauce was a little runny. \n\nThere's a lot more that I've tried and a lot more on their menu that I haven't tried.  For now, it's their oxtail and asparagus that keeps me wanting more. Thumbs up for price, value, and selection.",1

Beer and bites my ass!\n\nI have been here a number times, mostly because it is close to home.  It is always dead in here and the few people that frequent here are chain smokers.  On the bright side, I usually get good service here and if your just drinking beer it is good enough.\n\nI stopped by here for lunch and a few things rubbed me the wrong way.  I ordered the chicken club special and a bloody mary.  The bloody mary was $8.25.  Are well drinks in crappy local bars really 8.25?  The chicken club special was barely edible, I had to drink 3 glasses of water just to choke it down.  If you are going to offer a special - make it special or at least better than you average fare.  \n\nNow here is what really pisses me off.  When I order the special, the waitress asked what I wanted for a side.  It was implied that a side order came with a sandwich and a sandwich usually comes with a side at all places like this.  Nobody said anything about a charge for fries or anything!  I get billed for the special and extra for the sides.  It is just a dirty trick.  The special turned out to be anything but special.  \n\nA basic crappy bar lunch with one drink rings in at $37.  Really?  Then a tip and lunch for 2 people was over $40? \n\nNOTE to the owners of PT's:  You would be better off offering a better product at fair prices than trying to profit off every sandwich served.  You have about 25 tables in the restaurant part and I have never seen anyone sitting in there... and I can see why.",0

We ordered the drunken chicken which was boiled cold chicken cut into pieces bones and all with booze on top. No flavor, the texture of the cold chicken skin was like biting the inside if your own mouth. Trying to eat these bite size chunks with the sharp, jagged chicken bones inside was impossible. Next up we had a 5 spice beef appetizer which was again cold (WTF?) and was basically pho soup beef on a plate with cilantro. The plate was pretty just didn't taste that way. \nThose were the worst dishes. The best we had were the orange flavored chicken on a sizzling plate. A little deceptive in name as it tasted like chicken teriyaki on a sizzling fajita plate and that was fine by me. The beef rolls were also one of the other few high points in an underwhelming  dining experience. They were also seasoned with 5 spice and cilantro but the beef inside was brushed with a sweet sauce that worked well with the grilled wrap.\nThe rest of the dishes we tried were basically the same vanilla Chinese I find here in a lot of the Vegas local scene. Stick to China Town staples like Joyful House, Diamond China etc.",0

I ordered the Chicken Salad Sandwich on Sourdough with a side of salad. My husband had the same except he had his with Cibatta bread and a side of fries. The Chicken Salad had grapes, apples, celery,scallions and watercress. It felt very light and tasted like something you would have at a summer picnic. It was delicious and not your typical chicken salad which was refreshing to me. The salad that came with my meal was very fresh and the dressing complimented it perfectly.

It's hard to find (especially at night) because they don't have an illuminated store front sign just yet. So keep your eyes open! \n\nThe decor is modern. Clean and simple. There are smaller booths around the restaurant that seat 2-4. Large tables are available for bigger parties. There are an ample amount of high top bar tables that seat about 3 per table. Where the high top tables and booths are, you can see the open kitchen. It's a lot of fun to watch especially when they start pumping out their food. \n\nTheir food is tapas style, so don't expect large dishes that fill you up with leftovers to doggy bag. Everything on their menu screams fusion. Can't really put a finger on what they're a fusion of so I'll say that they fuse flavors from all around the world! The menu itself is super adorable. They separate their items by categories: pork, beef, chicken, seafood, veggies, cheese and dessert. Within each category, they have around 7 or 8 dishes to choose from. \n\nEach plate is priced anywhere from $5 to about $12. I took my cousin and we were content after 4 dishes. And then we saw servers carrying plates of food to other tables and decided to order 2 more dishes. In part, this was a big mistake. We had no room for dessert and became overly stuffed. \n\n- Complimentary popcorn: What a cool way to substitute your average bread and butter basket! Perfect amount of butter. \n- Sticky Bun Tacos: Fried pork belly, pickled cabbage and ginger soy. The pork belly wasn't greasy. I personally think this dish would be better if the pork was shredded. Total of 3 small tacos. \n- Albondigas: Meatballs with salsa roja with sliced jalapenos. Even without the jalapenos, there's a kick of heat in the sauce.\n- Brulee Salmon Skewers. Three pieces of salmon on a stick with a honey miso glaze and a side of warm Japanese cabbage salad. I thought the honey miso glaze tasted a lot like regular teriyaki sauce.\n-Pretzel Brats: 2 mini sandwiches - chicken sausage with cheese gravy and sauerkraut on pretzel bread. This was my fave, hands down. \n- Cremini caps: Mushroom caps filled with asiago cream and caramelized onions. For all you mushroom lovers, this is a very yummy appetizer. I can sit and muNch on these babies all day.\n - Tater Tots with truffle oil and parmesan cheese: the tots are super crispy on the outside with a soft and tender potatoey goodness on the inside. Truffle oil taste on every bite. I can munch on these all day, too. \n\nShout out to Groupon for making this trip possible!

1106,Went here the day after St. Patty's. Place was empty but the table we sat at still hadn't been wiped down. Still hadn't been wiped down by the time we left. Food was OK. I had a nice Black and Tan to start the meal and ordered the fish and chips. Received a huge portion of nicely fried Cod and shoe string fries. I personally like wedges or crinkle cut  round chips but it's not a big deal. They do have huge burgers and my friend couldn't finish his Cheese Burger. Neither had room for dessert. Typical pub. Nothing to rave about. Maybe they were just recovering from the day befores party. I'll give them another try the next time I'm in Scottsdale to see if I have a better experience.,0
1107,"it's a very very beautiful church as from inside and outside. \n\nthere was some admission cost when we tried to get in last time but all the times before I always went in for free. so not sure what the admission cost depends on - time of the day, day of the week or seasons. \n\nthere is also a light show that's highly advertised. we went for that (tickets were something like $12) but weren't really impressed. the set up is great but the scenario/story/length is too boring.",1
1108,"My fiance and I came in for a bite to eat, and was very pleased with everything.\n\nOur server Liliana was very nice. We had a great experience, she and the other servers were constantly at us with refills and always made sure we had everything we needed. Amazing service, I wish every restaurant had service like Babystacks!\n\nWe had a beef hash with rice, and the breakfast burrito, with a share of pancakes. The beef hash was solid, however the breakfast burrito could have been better, not much meat and the red sauce that it came with was too sweet to pair with it. The hazelnut pancakes were AWESOME. \n\nLong story short, good food, great service, we will be back!",1
1109,"Was psyched to hear they have a gluten-free menu. Although there are only 2 flavors-Pei Wei Spicy & the sweet & sour. That's good for my SO since he likes sweet & sour. I'm not a s&s fan so I'm stuck with just rice- would have liked the spicy but it's made with chicken broth so not vegetarian friendly which explains why they only list meat options on their gluten-free menu. If they would switch to veggie broth then we would get takeout weekly. But I can't get satisfied with just rice so they lost my biz. Staff is friendly but some really have no clue about the gf menu - for take out they gave packets of regular soy sauce when they have gf tamari. 2 stars because they made an attempt, and with a few tweaks could be a 4 or even 5 star.",0
1110,"This is hands down my boyfriend and I's favorite spot in Chandler... Actually... ANYWHERE.  We absolutely LOVE San Tan Brewery and are there almost weekly.  I always joke with him saying that one day we will have our rehearsal dinner there.  I can not say one bad thing about this place.  I walk in and it seems like people recognize us, that's when you know things are good! \n\nSan Tan becomes more packed everytime I go in, but I love that they do so well!  They are very casual, loud, and a bar setting.  Don't walk in expecting to get a Bud Light, or Miller Light.  My fave beers are the Epicenter and Hefe.  I have ordered so many different food items off the menu but my recent fave is the Pork Pabil.. Its amazing.  \n\nYou will never go wrong with San Tan Fries... they are the best fries I have ever had.  All the servers are awesome, I have never had bad service from anyone there.  The bar tenders are great, and always make you feel like you are the only person at the bar.  This place is awesome for groups, or a casual date.  We bring out parents all the time and they love it just as much as we do.",1
1111,"Great place to take in a baseball game. The times that I came here there were no concession stands but knowing that ahead of time was perfect, so it provided ample opportunity to run to the store to buy stuff or go somewhere or plan to go somewhere after the game.",1
1112,"First time at this location last night.  We went late in the evening and had a party of 3.  Got some drinks at the bar which was fine and then sat and waited for our table.  It was quite humid and hot where we were waiting as the air vent was dripping cause the humidity.  While we waited, not one person came to check on us or tell us why it was taking so long to be seated.  We finally were sat a table in the back after 25 min or so waiting.  Took approx 10 min before we had anyone come take our order.  We all ordered fairly simple food and only 1 time did anyone come to us to offer drinks.  We sat for nearly 45-50 min waiting patiently for our food and once we got it, no apologies or explanation.as to why it took so long.   We all had pretty much lost or apatite and barely even 10 min after getting our food, had our server come to us and ask us if we wanted desert (seriously lady ??!?) As we were waiting for our check the manager ( older lady with a raspy quick tone) was across from us, apologizing to another couple that was waiting nearly as long as us, for the wait.  No one came and asked how we were or how our service was or apologized for the delay.  Needless to say we paid and left dissatisfied and upset.  I have eaten at the old town location countless times and have always had superb service and food.  We will most likely not be returning to this location.",0
1113,"We first saw Chronic Tacos in LA, but never got the chance to eat there. So, when I heard there was one in Vegas, my brother and I sought it out. The only way to get there from my side on town - the SW - is to risk your life via several roundabouts. I'm a skilled driver, but I despise those things. We made it in one piece without incident, phew.\n\nNow give me food to calm myself.\n\nNot able to decide on what I wanted, I ordered three tacos: fish, carnitas and carne asada. My brother tried the chicken and carne asada. We were the only people in the restaurant and the staff seemed highly annoyed by our presence. \n\nI grabbed a diet coke from the soda machine and it tasted terrible, flat yet it tasted only like seltzer. I couldn't drink it. I don't do regular soda so I was out of luck.\n\nI dug into the tacos. The fish taco wasn't the worst I've had, but I wouldn't call it good. Edible. The Carnitas were the best of three. The carne asada was so salty. I about died. It was inedible. My brother agreed on the carne and thought the chicken was decent. \n\nI couldn't believe I risked my life on the roundabout deathtraps for this! Leaving, I was forced to gamble again. A few close calls, but we made it home safely. Thank goodness, I would not want Chronic Tacos for a last meal.",0
1114,"Elixir brings in a mid-to-late 20's/early 30s crowd that does more mingling/drinking than only dancing. They do have a small dance floor where some folks dance but it's a small minority of the total number of patrons. The bartenders are friendly enough but the wait to get a drink can be long when the place is jumpin'. The atmosphere is fun but not uppity.\n\nStill, it's a more sophisticated standby for those nights when other Southside joints are too collegey or dirrty for your maturing tastes (natch). Probably the classiest place on the Southside.",1
1115,"The Bellagio boasts the most diverse,carefully arranged feeding trough on the strip (that i can speak for), putting it in the running for one of the greatest buffets in the world. I came to their buffet between breakfast and lunch (we'll call it brunch) to a fair sized line. Despite this i was promptly seated, given my drink, and sent for my first helping. The cocktail shrimp were amazing and chilled perfect. The prime rib and london broil were exquisite. The African bluenose was delicious. Even the desserts, coming fresh from the oven, were pretty outstanding. I dont remember exactly what i paid, but it couldnt have been more than $20. It is by no means the cheapest buffet in town, but probably has the best value.",1
1116,"Reviewing airports? Guess I was compelled to after being yelled at by the annoying, power tripping, airport staff lady who thought it was okay to bark at anyone trying to avoid her escalator line control on the way up to the TSA security line. For a city dependent on people dumping their money on the strip, you'd think they'd up their efforts to provide a better gateway and experience to their patrons.\n\nThen again, the airport is okay at best most of the time especially when you think about the trainwreck that JFK & LAX can be. McCarran doesn't seem that bad anymore. Talk about low standards.\n\nArriving at McCarran is usually a smooth affair, the walk to the heavily advertised, spam filled baggage claim can be pretty fast even in the narrow corridors throughout the airport. Getting a taxi or shuttle is straightforward and the airport shuttle to the car rental center is a breeze & really convenient.\n\nLeaving is bit more difficult. Crowded check in terminals with not much space to move, long TSA lines, and not enough seating at the gates which are probably too close to one another. However, these complaints are all pretty trivial since it could be far worse in my past experience.",0
1117,"We went in there on Sunday for lunch, it was packed-well the foyer was at least. After sitting there for ten minutes we were led to a dinig area that was maybe 1/3 full of customers. I was a bit confused on their use of host and hostesess. There was one person taking names, another checking the names, two other standing their alternating taking the diners to their seats in the dated dining room. Christ the only reason we went to this place is because we had a gift card and I'm hoping the gift giver next year makes a better choice. So my wife ordered the fettucini alfredo with Chicken (she has a standard) and I ordered some sort of entre that appeals to men that only eat beef, toss it with some pasta and voila, Dinner!  The humorous moment was when the server asked me how I would like my braised beef done-it's braised, look it up. Anyhow the sauce with it was a cream base, had some portabella mushrooms with it and some fresh parsley (to make it appear fresh) though my entre looked like it has been sitting under the hot lights for a good 10 minutes. The salad we got was marginal (I don't get what the big deal is) and the breadsticks seemed like they'd been sitting in the basket for 10 minutes (not so hot)- While our food  wasn't absolutely horrible, I don't understand why this place is full all the time. I would love for it to be another 10 years (or more) until I eat here again....glad I wasn't paying for it!",0
1118,"\""""Greasy spoons\"""" are called such for a reason, but when you have a pool of that yellow margarine stuff under your hash brown, it's too much.\n\nThe biscuits and gravy were no better than the ones at Whataburger, and the eggs are definitely not fresh eggs.\n\nBut the biggest letdown of all was the coffee, which was several hours old. I've had baths hotter than this.\n\nThe only saving grace was the very pleasant and attentive servers, who (bless them) kept offering coffee refills.",0
1119,We stayed at the Monte Carlo and were looking for some food after a long day of walking the strip.  We decided to stop at the Pub and luckily we made it in time for Ladies Drink Free.  We got a free drink.  We ordered the spinach salad.  It was delicious.  We also ordered the meatball sliders.  BEWARE...they were not cooked.  We told the waiter and he returned the plate to the kitchen and gave us the meal free.  But then the waiter ignored us!  You would think they would want to give us some good service.  Make sure your meal is cooked!,0
1120,"I hate to give bad reviews but this place was definitely NOT GOOD.\nThe food here wasn't very flavorful and I'm not super picky on flavor. The chicken looked and tasted like it maybe wasn't chicken... There was a fish tank full of dead fish on display for the diners to see, gross. \n\nThere's millions of places to get Chinese food in Chinatown so I would not recommend this one. \n\nAlso I got sick to my stomach almost instantly after we finished eating. I usually prefer food that doesn't make me sick.",0
1121,"It is no New Orleans but the food was surprisingly decent for a chain restuarant.  The seafood was fresh and cooked well.  I had the halibut with the Diablo sauce.  They are great with mixing and matching sauces and fishes.  We also ordered a dozen raw oysters and oyster pappadeux.  There are hints of southern style cuisine such as dirty rice, crawfish sauce, and any seafood you like fried.  As for actual taste, I didn't get much southerness from the flavors.\n\nThe second time, we got the seabass and two of us got the all you can east lobster. The seabass was cooked well and the sauce was tasty. The lobsters came with dirty rice as the side and it was pretty good. The lobsters are a good decent size and good quality lobsters. I finished 5 of them and the other finished 9 of them. I think eating 3 would be good. i cant say it is necessarily a good deal because it is just eating too much lobster unnecessarily. The time in between each round of new lobster fluctuated a lot and the service was just decent.",1
1122,"I'm from SoCal, and come to Phx often for biz. I'm a fan of Paradise Bakery in general, but was really disappointed with this one.  I ordered a cuban, and gotta say it was pretty much the worst. Mostly bread - crappy bread and not chibatta-- one puny slice of ham, it wasn't grilled, and it took almost 20 minutes - super disappointing, and for $8 not a good value at all. Also got a cup of soup - it was good -- but for a total order of $12, I'm over the free cookie.  \n\nI got this to go for my road trip, and (frankly) gave a good part of it to the dog.  I probably should've gotten something from the Whole Foods next door, or even a $5 foot long....Where's a subway when you need one?\n\nLots of people waiting for food at 11 am, long line.  Others seemed to know the service was terrible and stuck to salads and pre-prepared things. \n\nI've had good experiences with other locations -- probably not going here again.",0
1123,"This airport sucks. You would think workers would know what to do or know where everything is considering that it's an international airport. Nope. Who say's, \""""I'm not sure\"""" and walks away? Really? Seriously, it's a guessing game here. Our flight home was in the late hours of the night. We came into the airport pretty early and the line was mildly short. My bf tried to check us in but it froze on him. Wtf man! He tried finding a worker from the airport but no one was available. I mean no one was there. He tried asking for help from the workers at Hawaiian Air and they didn't help either.  He finally found one after searching for at least ten minutes. By this time, the line for the bag check in got longer. Thank goodness I was standing in line already, or so I thought. After the first worker walked away, my bf found another guy (another 10 or 15 minutes wait) and this one told us to stand in the shorter line because we didn't check in properly. We were finally relieved that someone knew what they were doing. Yea right... Mind you, that short line or the line I was in had no sign of what each line was for. \n\nWe moved to the shorter line which only had two couples. OHH MUH GAWD! We stood in line for 45 minutes. Everyone who came after us on the other line had bypassed us. Not only did the airport worker screw us over, the Hawaiian Airline workers also screwed us over by making us wait 45 minutes. The only reason why they started helping us was because I yelled out for everyone to hear that all of us had been waiting for 45 minutes. I got a reply back from the Hawaiian Air worker; \""""please be patient, we are busy\"""".  I never ever yell out in public places but it was just too much for me.   We finally got checked in and had only 20 minutes to spare before they opened the gates for our flight. \n\nLuckily for me I hated Las Vegas. I probably won't come back unless it's something important. And since I won't be back, I won't have to deal with this airport. Thanks for ruining the end of my vacation McCarran International Airport and Hawaiian Air workers.",0

I went in Friday night to be greeted by a really rude girl who when asked questions made you feel stupid. The thing about this place is that they are fairly unique, when asking for a recommendation I don't need a sarcastic answer. I had before ordering just walked out as I couldn't handle it. I will recommend people against it, as it us not worth it at all when your initial impression is so negative.",0

A great little Irish Pub with some great food and drink offerings.\n\nMy husband loved the corned beef and cabbage, I enjoyed my fish and chips only complaint is that the chips were french fries....fish and chips need chunky fries! It is a tradition. The side of coleslaw though was delicious.\n\nThe VERY best part was dessert. Can highly recommend the Bailey's Irish Cream Bread & Butter pudding with custard. Speaks for itself really.\n\nThe atmosphere was nice and the staff were wonderful!",1
1126,"I am giving this place 4.5 stars. I went there on a night where it was so packed the line went from the front door to almost I dont know how long.

I ended up having to go home and clean around my cuticles with all the over spill and I have a hang nail on my pinky now. Worst and I mean WORST! Gel I've ever gotten.

I explored 3 styles of beers I'd never tried and then finished with 3 favorites to satisfy the taste buds.\n\nThere was a nice variety of food on the menu.  They have an interesting take on wings with the sauce on the side. Tried one of the salads which was tasty, but left you a little hungry...especially since it was the same price as the wings.  That moved us onto the Sweet Potato Tacos, which area little more like empanadas, but really tasty with a pesto dipping sauce.\n\nLiving in the southwest for so long I'd like to some type of hot sauce on the table or a homemade concoction to bring the heat.\n\nThe noise is a little loud, but they'll get the acoustics figured out.  The openness of the floor plan and windows will make it a great year round place for a pint.  It's smack dab in the middle of the Evans Churchill district which is great for a pub crawl",1
1131,Normally I wouldnt waste my time reviewing a fast food restaurant but the service at this KFC is a joke.  I've gone twice the past few months and it has been horrible.  Today the person working the register was also having to expedite the orders which made things super slow.  What was crazy was that the guy behind me ordered a chicken pot pie and they said it would take 35 minutes...and he decided to wait for it.   This place needs to hire more staff and TRAIN them.,0
1132,"If you're considering getting waxed, read below as well, but just for nails, well, the nail job was poorly done and rushed. I could have done a more thorough job at home, and not wound up with spots of nail polish on my skin. I will NEVER EVER ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever EVER go back!  And I highly recommend that you don't even try it, either. \n\nAnd in regards to the waxing: Oh if only you could give negative stars. In this case, I definitely would. I learned a hard lesson today. NEVER EVER use the \""""express\"""" salons/spas in malls. EVER! Especially when you've got to look nice (like, say, for your birthday party). I've used them before but NEVER again. The lady giving me my pedicure asked me if I wanted my eyebrows waxed. I said no. She asked again. I said no, again. She asked a third time (very pushy), and though I had been saying no, I knew it needed to be done because I had some scraggliness off to the side. So I finally said yes. AND I GOT BURNED! Like bright red, with tiny white welts BURNED! I looked like some sort of effed up raccoon. And they all kept staring, not asking if I needed aloe. It should have been obvious to anyone with eyes that the post-wax condition of my general eyebrow area WAS NOT normal. If they'd had an easily available mirror on the inside, I wouldn't have left. Period. It was embarrassing. I went to the Carmen! Carmen! Prestige Salon in Belk and they fixed EVERYTHING and I am so thankful that they had openings and were willing to help. \n\nAfterwards I went back to the salon, just to mention that their wax was too hot and they completely denied it and put the blame on me and said I should have asked them for aloe to fix it. Aloe didn't cut it. It took hours of ice compresses, along with several skin-clearing/redness-relief creams, and a full face of makeup to hide it for my birthday party that night. Also, apparently they use \""""multi-purpose wax\""""- I don't know what this means but it seems to imply that  it's not necessarily gentle enough for the face which would make sense.

No luck.

1140,"There's another review here which describes Saffron's interior as being more like a banquet hall than an Indian restaurant and I have to concur completely. When we arrived at around 8PM on a Saturday the large rectangular building was empty with the exception of two other pairs of customers at the round tables in the main part of the room. Down one side there are four half-booths, although only two of these appear to be available for customers, with one having a computer set up upon it and the other, outfitted with a pair of mismatched, padded office chairs appears to be used as a hangout for the proprietor's children when they aren't helping out with the restaurant.\n\nAfter being instructed by a small child to \""""just sit anywhere\"""" we took one of the open booths and another child brought us our menus. The covers looked slightly grubby, like they could have used a wipe down and I noticed a large stain on the side of the booth next door to ours - it looked like someone had spilled a large glass of coke over the side of the table at one point and that it had been allowed to set before washing. Chairs and tables were covered with plastic to ward off such spillages and the plastic on top of our table felt like it could have been a little cleaner also, as could the salt and pepper shakers which felt a little grimy when we moved them.\n\nThe restaurant is a bit odd and has a little raised section in the corner opposite the door and the 1970s disco ball in the middle of the room. The disco ball was just a mystery and I expected to see the four children from The Chronicles of Narnia file in and take their places in the four throne-like armchairs upon the curious dais at any moment. It was an unusual atmosphere.\n\nAfter a few minutes our host arrived with a jug of room temperature water with shrink wrap covering the top. He had collected this from one of the central tables which was home to a collection of such jugs. He seemed very friendly, however, and quickly accepted our restaurant.com certificate and enthusiastically took our order. In order to meet the $35 requirement we ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Malai Kofta, Shahi Paneer, and a selection of Naan (two garlic, one sesame).\n\nOur host then presented us with some pappadums and the usual chutneys of tamarind and mint. The mint chutney had a nice kick to it and although the tamarind had an uncharacteristically odd \""""ketchupy taste\"""" it mellowed into a pleasant aftertaste so it all worked out. We were cheerfully informed that we could ask for more pappadums if we liked and as the host departed I commented to my wife about how the friendliness and enthusiasm was enough to make me overlook some of the oddities of the place in my upcoming Yelp review.\n\nDespite the fact that there were very few others in the restaurant we didn't see any staff again for the forty or so minutes it took for our food to arrive. I wasn't bothered at all by the longer than average wait time and the food more than made up for it anyway. My Chicken Tikka Masala was a little milder than I am used to, however the very nutty and savoury Shahi Paneer was a perfect accompaniment. I found my garlic naan to be tasty without being amazing, but my wife found her sesame naan to be a little overcooked on the bottom. The Malai Kofta was somewhat different to other incarnations of this dish that I've experienced. The sauce tasted more like a onion/butter sauce than creamy, but was tasty, however the kofta themselves were dark, somewhat sharp in flavour and fell to pieces at the merest touch of an eating utensil. Overall though, the food was excellent and we couldn't wait to return and I expected to award the restaurant four stars with a disclaimer about the slightly odd vibe to the place and maybe a friendly suggestion that they wipe up a bit in my review.\n\nThis is where things took a turn for the worse. A medium sized party had entered the restaurant and placed their orders just as I was enjoying the last bites of sauce-dipped naan and they also appeared to have a couple of take-out customers. Our host asked me how everything was to our enthusiastic responses and disappeared into the kitchen.\n\nI got my credit card out and politely sat at the table waiting to deal with my bill. Twenty minutes later we were still waiting. Ten minutes later I asked a child if they could ask someone to help us with our bill. Twenty minutes passed and a surly woman came out, but it was to deal with a takeout customer. The child still clutched our bill and restaurant.com certificate. Finally, after about an hour of waiting we were finally dealt with and could get out of there, lamenting that we could have driven across town to our home TWICE in the time we waited to pay for our meal.\n\nThe food here is great, but being made to wait a full hour (no exaggeration) to pay, including 30 minutes after you TELL THEM you want to pay is just unacceptable, especially when there were at least three adult staff members and custom was slow.",0
1141,"I would give fuddruckers 4 stars, but the service at this one is outstanding! Adrian was informative and super friendly, accommodating, and honest. The Guy grilling the burgers did a great job and was also freindly and engaging. Even the dude that wiped our table was super nice.",1
1142,"I'm surprised this place hasn't taken off yet! Good price, great sushi, awesome staff. It's mostly awesome for the quick lunch. I just wish they had a website 1, but their hours will be better when they're open for dinner next week.",1
1143,"I've always had issues with this cable company. They always raise their prices, even though I've seen ads on tv saying how they don't raise their prices, but the other companies do. \nOooh Cox, you little liars.\n\nThe past month I have had issues with channels not working and when you call Cox, they tell you it's no them and it's that particular network, so the issue is say with the TLC network and not Cox. Um ok!  Damn it! I'm trying to watch a \""""What Not To Wear\"""" marathon and TLC is not coming in! Fix it you effers!\n\nTheir service is just down right expensive and there are all these little fees that seem ridiculous to pay for. \n\nFor months we have been trying to get the phone number on file changed as they have an old phone #, but they never make the change. \n\nI'm pretty fed up with their service, but really the area of town I live in I don't have much of a choice but to use their service for cable and internet.",0
1144,"Went here to ship some stuff for our relatives. I stood there for a good five minutes before being helped, even thug there was no one else in the store. After that some lady tried to tell me that the couldn't ship dry ice. I told her that it wasn't dry ice, it was just ice packets. Then she said I would have to buy one of their boxes even though what I had brought in was perfectly wrapped. Finished up by just walking out of the store, and the lady helping me just turned her back and walked away as if this was the most normal thing in the world to happen in an exchange with a customer. We went back two weeks ago trying to ship some pots back in a box that the manufacturer actually sent to us, and it had a \""""place shipping label here\"""" box on it. They said that it was not acceptable and that we would have to buy one of their boxes. We left and went to our normal PostNet on Flamingo and they just said, \""""Sure\"""" and shipped it. Total rip off. \n\nStay away from this place.",0
1145,"We normally love Pei Wei but yesterday when we went we ordered our normal order of chicken fried rice and pot stickers. When we got our fried rice there was a hair at least 4\"""" long weaves through the rice. So disgusting, I took the plate over to a server standing next to the manager and tried to get the managers' attention (he ignored me) so I pulled the hair out of the rice and showed the the server. She took the plate from me not saying a word and followed me back to our table to pick up the bowl and took it back to the kitchen. I had to ask her a few minutes later if they were remaking it an she nodded yes. The manager never came over to our table and seemed to hide in the back until his shift ended. \nOne of our favorite restaurants and we will not be visiting for awhile!",0

We split the veggie salad that tasted bland and I couldn't even taste the jicama and beans.  The avocado saved the salad.\n\nI've had better service, but it wasn't the waitress' fault.  The manager should have hired more staff as this poor waitress was serving at least 20-30 people out on the patio.  It took us over an 1.5 hours to get our 4 piece brucetta and salad.\n\nThe only reason I am giving 2 stars is due to the great selection of wine. Sorry 5th and Wine but I'm sticking with Postinos.",0
1147,This is the second time I have driven all the way from Glendale and they have not been open during the hours posted which pisses me the fuck off. I went there last Saturday and got there at 305 and they said they closed at 3!' Even though it says 4. And today if went there to try and get tacos for a party and there is a lock on the door!! It's total bullshit all I want is their delicious tacos but if they can't get there act together about when they are and are not open I'll take my business and taco craving stomach else where.,0

The people that work here know us well, and we joke and laugh together.  They are super helpful.  Whenever our favorite soda is out, there are more than willing to run to the back and change it.  There is also a wide selection of snacks and other drinks in the refrigerated section.  They keep the store clean, and clutter free.\n\nAll in all, if you are looking for a quick place to pick up snacks for the movies, or a quick drink for work, run over to this location.  They are always willing to help!",1
1149,This review is just for the afternoon tea.  \n\nSandwiches were bland and unspectacular.  Scone's were hard.  Desserts varied from subpar to pretty decent.  The worst part was the tea which was not even as good as good as what you can get from Pete's.  It wasn't even just my tea.  I went in a group of ten and tried some of the other ones and they were all just okay.  What you really get is decor and ambiance but honestly the place is located in the middle of a casino and there is casino visibly all around you even when you are seated inside.  I can't say ingredients are much better or quality was better... nothing was really better to justify the price premiums.   Even service was only average.\n\nI gave an extra star though cause i did like the lemon custard.  Try to always find a positive.  It helps you get through life.,0
1150,"This place gets no star from me! I'm only putting one star b/c I had to.\n\nFirst of all, the place was a mess! It looked like they used one corner for as their 'junk closet.'\n\nSecond, the owner's lil boy was in there riding his bicycle!! Are you kidding??? The lil boy was screaming, throwing tantrums, hitting the chairs, etc. w/ his bike and his parents just sat there watching tv. Mind you the restaurant had about 15 customers in there. \n\nThirdly, I asked the waitress what something was in my soup and she said she didn't know. I asked her if she worked there and she said yes but never tried that soup before. I don't care if you've tried it or not - you're Vietnamese, you work there, you should know your own damn food!!\n\nFourth, they had a long extension cord running from inside the restaurant - out the door through the parking lot - ending God knows where. \n\nLastly, never going there again.",0
1151,Great pizza. I had two different pizzas. One was the Manhattan. I can't recall what the other pizza was. I came here after shopping at the Las Vegas outlet. The employees were nice. The decor is interesting and fitting. The pasta servings is enough to feed at least two people. Might be much for one average person. Wait time for our food was a reasonable five minutes for the pizza since they just needed to reheat it. The pizza took about 15 minutes to make.,1
1152,"So how does a Latina know the best Vietnamese food?  Well, growing up in LA, specifically an area called Monterey Park - just outside of East LA - my neighborhood is part of the San Gabriel Valley's amazing Asian cuisine landscape.... Moving to Charlotte with my husband, meant that we left behind some of the most awesome Asian cuisine.... just look up a place called \""""Golden Deli\"""" in San Gabriel, CA and you'll know what I mean....\n\nSo we have been exploring Charlotte's food scene and looking for some of our favorite cuisines... We love Pho, the traditional Vietnamese rice-noodle soup, and Ben Thanh does not disappoint on this soup: the broth is fragrant and flavorful.... I also love their egg noodle soup with wontons... The only thing I would love to see is that they improve on their Imperial Rolls... Although their spring rolls are very fresh and my husband loves them.... We have gone back for their Pho and are glad we found this place!  They are also great with kids - our two-year old loves the broth and we ask for the rice noodles on the side so he can enjoy too!  They're always nice and have great service....",1
1153,"Had a very solid eating experience at Comme Ca in Vegas.  Our waitress was very nice and service was prompt.  For our starter we tried the steak tartar.  It was very good and well seasoned, not the best that I've had but I'd say a solid 4 star dish.  Then for dinner my friend and I split the mussels and the spinach.  The spinach was a bit too oily but I really enjoyed the chorizo mixed in with the mussels and the smokey flavor it gave.  For my cocktail I tried the Comme Ci because the flavors seemed interesting.  It was good but a little too heavy on the sugar component for my liking.  There were more dishes on the menu that looked intriguing to me so I'd love to come back and try some more.  Each dish was not the best that I've had but definitely an above average score of 4.  The helpful service definitely made the experience better too.",1
1154,"Ate here 1 and 1/2 times. The first time I really enjoyed the pizza but the service was slow. Being a pizza lover and living so close by I returned. The 2nd time was awful, we were rudely seated, then left to wait for literally 10 minutes. When we made eye contact with the waitress to place our order, she ignored us. We tried a second time, but the waitress said it was another waitress's table. After close to 15 minutes of waiting, we got up and left!",0
1155,"The mister and I came here for some celebratory dinner. I relied on Yelp for a some good sushi and Koishi came up.\n\nPlace -  You have to be careful when trying to find the entrance to the restaurant.  I knew the vicinity of the place, but almost missed the entrance when I finally saw the sign to the restaurant.\n\nFood - I was somewhat overwhelmed with the choices of sushi, appetizers, entrees, and etc.. But with a little help from the waitress, I started with the volcano salad - crab, masago, cucumber, medium spicy.. OH MY GOODNESS, was deeelicious.  I am craving it now, while I am typing this. Then I ordered the traditional shrimp tempura roll, which was not bad, and my husband loved the cherry blossom roll (since we were told i was the most popular one).  \n\nService - We had a kind waitress who was attentive and took care of us.  So I cannot complain. \n\nPrice - It was manageable.  As any sushi place, they will be a bit pricey, but we chose this place because it was not as pricey as other sushi restaurants.  \n\nKoishi! My husband and I will be back!",1
1156,Thought we'd try something new other than Papa Johns. I'm very pleased to say we will be ordering from here in the future. \n\nWe were pretty skeptical whether or not we needed a large or extra large so we went to the XL Venezia supreme and hot wings. \n\nThe tasting of the pizza and wings were exquisite! Not too much marinara and just enough cheese. Our order was expected 45 to an hour wait but we ended up waiting about 40 minutes. \n\nVery satisfied with our first experience.,1
1157,"The Tom kha is pretty good, panang curry was okay too but they are stingy on the meat and their tempura is more like fishstick breading, definitely not tempura. It was okay. Probably find a different place to eat next time.",0

Any Asian person really, Asian people love to talk and to eat... is there anything better??!!\n\nCame here again with my son and as I salivated over the menu, I couldn't wait to come here over a period of several wks to try the various dishes so in one seating I ordered:\n\noyster omelette\ndeep friend chitterlings Taiwan style\nchitterlings noodle soup\nstir friend rice noodles Taiwan style\ntaro smoothie w boboa\nand a mango smoothie \n\nI wish I could write that I ordered all this food cause my son is a big eater... but alas, he's four... but, hmmm, me and my stomach really enjoyed all this food... everything was very tasty.\n\nDon't worry, of course there were left overs which I took home for another meal... well, I'm not sure if the food lasted until the next day... I might have had them for a snack... tasty tasty!",1
1159,"We used to frequent the Albertsons on Town Center and Charleston, but this one is our favorite one now.\n\nThe shopping center is very nice and very close to Redrock.  It brings a feeling of not being in Las Vegas since you're west of the 215 beltway.\n\nThis new store is different from the many others I've been to.  it is new and has a better layout with what seems like a better selection of produce.\n\nThe store feels very clean, the staff are friendly and even though the layout is different from other stores, things are very organized and easy to find still. The signs are accurate and I like the fact that the isles do not span the length of the store; rather they have an isle that runs through the middle of the width of the store as well and it is more convenient to navigate.",1
1160,"Real Mexican Fast Food! It was really good but still not as good as Plaza Mexico in Eastpointe, Michigan. I got a burrito and rice. The people were nice. I bought 4 25 cent mustaches from the toy coin machine. Hit the spot.",1

Walked in, jammed, figured it would be a long wait......surprise, within 15 minutes we were at the counter - which was an awesome place to luck into sitting.\nOur waitperson, Carol - outstanding!! - guided us through the extensive menu......as usual when we're new to somewhere, we over-order.....but oh so good.  Sushi was killer - best I've had since Honolulu. \nLove the BYOB - our Chardonnay was a tad warmish by the time we got seated, but staff brought over an ice bucket (classy!).....\nWe'll definitely be back - maybe just won't order so much.  Agreed with some reviewers can be a tad pricey - but given the quality, I don't mind paying........worth a visit if you have shied away so far.",1
1162,"My family got there just in time for happy hour but they don't serve happy hour at the table, you have to literally goto the bar.  We also don't know what was available for happy hour because you only get to see that menu/special in the bar area.  So we were VERY disappointed.  At the very least they should advertise it in the regular dining room so people will know for next time and will come back and goto the bar area.  Dinner was good, but not great.  We were going to order some margaritas and they sounded really yummy on the menu and even saw another table with some, but there were no prices on the menu which means EXPENSIVE!!  So we didn't order any drinks.  No real complaints.  We of course waited for our check and that took awhile (not uncommon for most places)  \n\nWe came back about 2 weeks later for the fajita lunch buffet and we were the only ones enjoying the buffet and it was yummy but they weren't setup for it and some of the items were cold.  We were disappointed and won't be back for it.",0
1163,"After looking at all the Yelp reviews, I knew this place was either gonna be a hit or a miss. We basically just wanted a place to sleep since we were planning to be out pretty much the whole weekend. So we decided to go the economic route and gambled on this hotel. Well, let's just say, it was definitely a miss for us. Economic or not, we won't be coming back here again.\n\nPros: \n-Room cost is relatively cheap compared to other hotels. \n-I heard they renovated, so the rooms LOOKED decent. \n-Check-in and -out was pretty fast for us, BUT the line was quickly forming behind us. \n\nCons: \n-The bathroom sink's drain was closed and there was no way of opening it. The sink was quickly filling up with water we used to wash our faces. Gross.\n-The bathroom/shower was small and stuffy with no fans or windows.\n-The AC SUCKED. I woke up so many times throughout the night because I was so hot, not to mention, IT WAS LOUD. \n-They charge you $10 for resort fee PER NIGHT plus tax or whatever else they charged because my CC came back and it was $11.30 per night.\n-Not much of a resort. Our apt complex's pool was about the same size. I didn't bother going, but I could see it from our room. It was sad. I paid $22 for NOT using their crummy \""""resort\"""". Nope, you can't opt out. \n-$5 parking fee. You can get that back at the front desk when you check in, and they'll give you a parking permit.",0

Also, order the buffalo wing wrap with ranch and the pasta salad, awesome stuff!",1
1166,"They specialize in fish tacos, and I can honestly say they are the best I have ever had!! They are pricey but you get what you pay for here. I do agree with other reviews about the lack of side orders. It would nice to have something not fried, like some black beans!!",1

I called customer service and this stupid indian lady kept telling me she would mail me a pin. I could NOT for the life of me make her understand I wanted my password reset. For about 5 minutes this went on until I said \""""can i please speak to someone who knows what they are doing\"""" she YELLED back at me that she KNOWS what she is doing. I said I would like to speak to a supervisor.. she said \""""may I ask what this is in regards to\"""" UM DUH! I said I dont want to talk to you anymore.

I thought you wanted a new pin because your CC wouldnt work.. WOW I told her 4 times throughout the call that I CUT UP my card. I had missed a payment by 1 day and I called customer service and asked if they could reverse the 25 fee..this dude proceeds to give me a lecture about how I need to learn to pay my bills on time.

The service was immediate and attentive. They have a buffet and a menu from which to order. I chose the buffet because I wanted some vegetables. Although the food tasted fine, the buffet is very limited in choices: salad, cabbage, fried chicken and a couple of other choices. This would have been OK except that they charged over $9.00 for it.

Even though our waitress was training another waitress, it didn't interfere with the service or our overall dining experience.\n*PERFECT TIMING - any great dining experience has great service and great PACE with that service; quick, but not rushed.  We were able to get in and out within 45min, which was just what my gf and I were looking for.\n*PRICE - For such a nice, upscale feeling place, the prices are very reasonable.  We were able to get in and out for UNDER $30, and that included a Mimosa.  \nPARKING -  COMPLIMENTARY VALET\nFOOD - Both of our dishes (see pics) were very tasty and filling.

1171,"As a relatively new resident of the valley, I'm disappointed that it has taken me several months to patronize this establishment.  Last night, we left our first visit to Oreganos both satisfied and in great anticipation of our return.  \n\nThe atmosphere is very friendly and laid back.  The d\u00e9cor is reminiscent of a hometown pizza joint from the '50's.  Outdoors is a large patio with a bar.  The entire staff makes you feel at home, with the hostesses calling your name as a friend would, not as someone waiting in line at the butcher.  The wait staff is equally friendly and attentive with excellent recommendations.  \n\nOur service was matched in satisfaction by our food.  We started with the Guaca Tony, a delicious pairing of garlic pizza crust chips and Italian guacamole.  For dinner, we split the Big Rig Pasta, agreeably, a favorite of our server.  Our meal was washed away with a pitcher of Dos Equis, leaving us no room for one of Oreganos' popular cookies for dessert.   However, I would welcome a better beer selection for such a unique destination.\n\nThis is a place that would be great to bring your family or a large group of friends.  We'll definitely be returning soon.",1

I have been there twice and it is the only time in years of eating out that I have felt the need to add salt and pepper to my dishes, BOTH TIMES!  There are way too many really good places to eat just minutes from this restaurant for about the same price.  Also, what is with the truck Trailer(s) in your parking lot.  It's not a big lot in the first place.  \n\nOk so enough bashing.  You have a great concept and a great looking restaurant.  Figure out your kitchen so food comes out timely.  Tweek your recipes so the food had a lot more flavor.  (We put up with \""""True Food\"""" portion sizes only because the food is pact with flavor.) Organize your servers and wait staff so it is more efficient and organized (you may think it's organized but it doesn't seem like it or look like it.)

Technically your liable either way since you dont have anything staing your not liable for damage, and Curtis told me a customer came in with stretched tiers and wide wheels.

I've had to bring it in a couple times to have the hubcap fixed but other than that the car drives very well and has a lot of cool features. Everyone is really nice and helpful at this location. Each time I've been in the store Sica has gone ABOVE and BEYOND to help me. She took the time to show me additional features in my car that I didn't know I had.

Being a foodie, I asked the cashier (owners wife) what the most popular/ best dish is. I was recommended the chicken shawarma. \n\nMy thoughts after my first 2 bites, SERIOUSLY??? I've never had shawarma before, but to me, it taste like white meat chicken simmered in buffalo wing sauce and rolled up in a pita. As for the shredded lettuce my fellow Yelpers referenced, I can't speak on that accompaniment to my shawarma because they must have run out. Lol\n\nThe tziki sauce taste like plain yogurt with chunks of cucumber in it and the hummus had such a heavy hand of garlic to it, I felt like I could scare off Dracula with one breath. \n\nOn the bright side, the pita was fresh made and delicious, however if the bread is the best and only delicious part of a meal, there's a problem. I know there are vegetarians, vegans, fruitarians and pescetarians. But who just eats bread?\n\nFor this restaurant, good thing there are inebriated college students.",0
1182,Ordered food for delivery last night. The General Tso's Chicken was awful. It was like they didn't cook the chicken pieces long enough. Breading was droopy/soggy - there was no crispiness at all. Carrots were not cooked all the way through either. Wontons were cold.,0
1183,"I placed the order for coworkers birthday. Order successfully went through and receive a confirmation email. The next day when the order was supposed to be delivered to our job, they never showed up. The online check is a joke and is inaccurate. When I called the next day to cancel the order, the order number was completely wrong and was mass confusion. Then they went on to tell me they tried to deliver the arrangement but the business was closed. Which was untrue because the business didn't close till 10 PM. Had to haggle to get a refund back. Didn't receive an apology or any compensation what so ever.",0
1184,"I don't usually write reviews but today I decided this place was worth one:)\n   \n I just got the 12 piece chicken meal for the family and I have to say, it was delicious!\nChicken was crispy, not greasy at all, coleslaw was awesome. Kids loved the mac and cheese and biscuits ( I don't eat them ) but they said it was great. Also got an order of he butterfly shrimp which was delicious.  Definitely worth going back for!",1
1185,"Ok so i have now tried this place 3 times and i hate to say this but i prob wont be back again:( the service is great, the atmosphere is fun and lively but it is HOT in the restaurant and the food is not yummy. I have sent back food, packed it and just threw it away at home and/or just ate it because i was so hungry!! The food always takes a long time to cook, which isn't a bad thing because u know its being made fresh but then to wait that long and then not like the food....ughhh. So sad because this place is really cute and the servers are great!!",0
1186,"Our first meal upon arrival to Las Vegas, even before we checked into our Hotel... Service here is very friendly and the food just amazing.\nWe had the Shrimp Toast with bold flavors of the sausage and you could taste the garlic on the toast.\nMy son had the Fat Choy Burger, such good burger patty, well seared with the fried egg on top, very well done burger.\nI had the short rib rice and let me tell you, that short rib had to be one of the most tender and delicious I've ever had. served also with a little salad on the side which is lightly dressed.\nLast but not least, we split the Duck Bao! Oh My! soft little pillow \""""tacos\"""":) with crunchy duck skin and soft tender duck meat, fresh little \""""salad\"""" all in one little package...\nTo drink we had a \""""Gummy Bear\"""" soda and a Peach mellow yellow.\nCan you believe our bill was only around $40! incredible.",1
1187,This place is great!  I went in late in the day with a broken ipad screen and Vahe had it repaired fast!  The cost was the lowest I could find and he was very friendly and helpful!  I highly recomend i Doctor AZ!,1
1188,"I stayed here for a couple of days before heading to The Westin in Henderson for a Spartan race, and was very sad to leave.\n\nFirst of all, the concierge service and people checking guests in were extremely friendly and courteous. That's to be expected in the hospitality field, but I find it seriously lacking these days so I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nI completely agree with another Yelper in that the room was like a studio apartment, complete with a kitchenette. The jacuzzi tub was nice the one time I actually used it, and the bathroom was spacious, with a separate area for the toilet.\n\nUpon check-out, the staff was again very friendly and the bellman actually went to Valet and got my car himself since he felt that they were taking too long!\n\nI would definitely recommend this place.  I liked the fact that there was no casino downstairs (although it is connected to the MGM Grand).  I appreciated not being forced to walk through smoke-filled rooms to make my way to the elevator.\n\nThe next time I'm in Vegas, I would have no hesitation in staying here, and the rates are actually pretty reasonable, especially considering the quality of room and service you're getting.",1
1189,"I cannot sing Tim Walter's praises loud enough.\n\nI have taken my car to him for about 5 years, and I always leave with a new experience attesting to his awesomeness. If you think you might have something wrong with your car that you're not sure what it is, you can just stop by, and he'll usually take a break from what he's working on to get in your car with you and drive for a little bit and then give you his opinion. Then, when he diagnoses your car, he'll explain it to you like you're not an idiot, and he'll make sure you understand what's going on. He's incredibly honest and cares about his customers. For instance, once I had a tire that needed to be replaced but he didn't have it in stock. He told me how much it would cost to have the tire ordered and how long it would take to come in, then he called another shop to see if they had it and asked how much they were charging for it, and he sent me there because it would be cheaper and faster for me than having him order it. The price difference was like ten bucks, so I had him do it because it wasn't an emergency and I'd rather give him my business. He's awesome.",1
1190,"I attended a happy hour party on Friday. The party includes one drink for one dollar and the rest at a discounted four dollar rate. I ordered two stoli o and sodas - but my first was significantly weaker than the second even though it was made by the same bartender. It wasn't a huge deal, but  I feel that drinks should at least be consistent. The happy hour party comes with free appetizers as well. They hand everything out to you most likely to conserve food. I felt overall the temperatures were off  but most of what I tried tasted  pretty good. \n\nThe real reason for the meh review had to do with a bus person (or manager)- I really am not sure who he was. Basically we had two or three tables pushed together because we had a large group. He kept obsessing about our seating arrangement and trying to push our chairs in. It wouldn't have been a huge deal but there were four chairs to a small table-top and we would have been packed in like sardines if we kept the table the way he clearly wanted it. Even when we said we needed a bit more room he stomped around us and was visibly agitated. We were not creating any kind of distraction and the chairs were not a hazard the way we had them, he was compulsive about them, it was really strange.\n\n\nThe instrumentals were good - and the musicians clearly had a wide-range of song knowledge. The vocals were not nearly as good, in fact I hate to say it but they were just kind of bad. \n\nAll in all I don't think id go again, one dollar drink or not...",0
1191,I recently stayed here and my stay was mostly uneventful. But the hotel is cheap.... Rightfully so.\n\nThe hotel has no elevators so make sure you can lug your luggage up the stairs. There are several reports of bed bugs that were reported to the front desk that they didn't care about. I didn't see any bed bugs or bug bites.  \n\nParking is a royal bitch... Apparently there is a hidden parking lot somewhere where you pay a guy some money for a parking spot... I read reviews that cars were broken into in that lot so I just ended up parking in front for free during posted hours.  (Free hours were mostly evening and early mornings.)  I forget what the hours in which you didn't have to pay the meter but I basically scheduled my day around being gone at those hours so I didn't ever have to park in a shady lot that couldn't guarantee my car's safety.,0
1192,"Its hard to get 5 stars out of me and I don't always have valid reasons but this place came VERY close to getting 5 stars.  \n\nI love the fact that it is hidden to some extent and the fact that it is small.  After living in NY for several years I learned  to appreciate these types of restaurants/cafes.  The price is right and the portions are perfect!  \n\nI ordered the falafel and I like Kabob Grill's better BUT this was a VERY good wrap and I love the fact that it was offered on a wheat pita.  I wish it had hummus or tahini sauce on it but they went a different route.... They put onion, tomato, lettuce and tzatziki on theirs...which was still great!  I didn't try the fries but the people next to me no doubt caught me peeping their plate...the fries looked amazing!!  I should have just asked them for one.  lol!\n\nMy friend got the cheeseburger pita wrap, which was unique in and of itself!  He thoroughly enjoyed it!!  He even paid a compliment to the chef after his last bite with a loud belch.  Once again, the people beside us must have thought were were incredibly wack.  But, we enjoyed OUR meals!  \n\nThe best part of it all was the price.  I appreciate the fact that they serve fresh, tasy grub for a reasonable price.  Hats off to them and I WILL be back!!",1
1193,"Our Foodie Adventure has just begun!!!  Had dinner at The Harvest Restaurant last night.  We asked if we could just sleep there so we could have breakfast too.  Seriously, this place has killer food!\n\nIt also has a relaxing atmosphere and friendly staff.  The three of us shared Duck Tacos, Fried Calamari and Lobster Bisque. All were outstanding.  The Calamari was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, served with Homemade Marinara Sause.  Yummy!  I also have to mention the bread cause its my favorite addiction.  Four kinds with whipped butter.\n\nMy entree was Garlic Shrimp & Grape Tomato over Angel Hair with snow peas and fresh basil.  The shrimp were sweet and buttery, the flavors blended perfectly.  My husband had Roasted Long Island Duck with Citrus Orange Sauce.  It was so good that he picked the last bits of  Daffy off the bones with his fingers.  My daughter had the Lemon Pepper Shrimp which she chose not to share with anyone cause, \""""they are too good\"""".\n\nBelieve it or not, we even had dessert. Fresh Mixed Berry Pie, topped with latice crust and whipped cream.  Bananas Foster, covered with buttery cinnamon sauce and ice cream.  Both were \""""to die for\"""".\n\nBottom line is, we can't wait to go back again and again.  Breakfast and lunch, here we come!!!",1
1194,I stay at the Wynn 6-8 times a year. Lakeside was my first time visit. They only had 3 star review but I still decided to try with my wife and few friends. I was very disappointed when they brought me the bill it was $150 higher then we ordered it. Waitress immediately apologize and told me she is going to fix it but it has been 10 days and nothing got reversed...Stay away from Lakeside...,0
1195,Wow... can you say bland? Flautas would be much better with seasoning. The Peppi Burger was too small for the bun and had more breading then stuffing in a Thanksgiving Turkey. If you like guacamole from a jar and tasteless food this place is for you.,0
1196,Great decor and experience at the bouchon each time I've been here.... \n\nGreat for brunch which is why most people go here but also great for dinner \n\nCroque madame is amazing for brunch \n\nFor dinner.... \n- sea bass was good except the sauce was slight on the salter side \n-the chicken was super tender and the sauce complimented well\n-the lamb was pretty good and amazing! Texture was just perfect \n-foie Gras in a jar was good it was tasty and paired well with the slight salt.... but I actually really liked it with jam it off setted some of the saltiness\n\nAwesome service!\nAaron Pana manager and our server Danny surprised our bride to be with a a box of macaroons.... she really wanted them so the manager walked over to the bakery and got some macaroons it was amazing with our coffee,1
1197,"Ordered a grilled chicken salad and sangria.  The dressing on the salad was very tasty.  Shared some tapas with my sister- the brie/apple/almond combo was delicious. Great ambiance -- dim lighting, friendly wait staff, and a wall dedicated to wines alone.  Live musician playing cover songs on acoustic guitar - phenomenal.  In addition, they held a wine tasting and I got a little lesson on wines! Hope to come back again the next time I am in town",1
1198,"It was Saturday night we had just got done eating at a pretty bad restaurant and we wanted some really good ice cream to wash the flavor away. We looked on yelp and saw this place. It was a bit far from where we were for ice cream, but we decided to try it anyway. 20 miles later we had arrived, the place was small but inviting. The lady who help us was really nice, she let us try any sample we wanted and answered any question we had on the flavors. \nI couldn't decide what I wanted so I got a vanilla waffle cone and my boyfriend tried their red velvet waffle cone. They were both great! The waffle cone was so delicious, it was the best part! It also had an awesome gooey suprise at the end of the cone, it was a marshmallow that had soaked up the ice cream and tasted so good. This place was defiantly worth the drive.",1
1199,"The food was \""""OK\"""" for frozen, out of the bag, canned, run of the mill, heat and eat. \n\nThe description makes it sound Yummy.. but the taste doesn't backup the menu (or the price).\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love my gay boys, but when you're a waiter, it's not always cool to show your \""""I'm a Diva\"""" side when you're waiting on a table of 6 people that can either make your night with a good tip, or leave you a $1.00, which it wasn't even worth that. \n\nThe \"""" I'm a diva in my real life, but I'm just playing waiter tonight\"""" attitude really sets a bad tone for the night.",0
1200,"I've only been here once, but I can't wait to go back.  \nI had the ceviche, the beef tenderloin, and the arroz con leche and it was all so extraordinary.\n\nThe portions were humongous.  The seafood was fresh and full of zest and flavor.  \n\nThe price was very reasonable.\n\nThe venue is a bit small, but the service is friendly and outgoing, and the ambiance is very clean and relaxing.",1
1201,"This was the first hotel I stayed in Vegas, and of course at the time I liked it (I didnt know any better), now that time has passed I can say that I really dont like the place (sorry) the area where it is sucks, I take a Downtown Hotel any time, and sometimes they are even cheaper. Oh and dont even get me started on the buffet, it made the person who was with me really sick.",0
1202,"I love my dog, even though she's a bitch. *rim shot*\n\nSo when I have to drop her off somewhere for a couple nights, I don't mind paying a bit more for a quality kennel.  And that's exactly what Club K9 is.\n\nI've used Club K9 only about 4-5 times over the last year.  Most kennels wouldn't consider that an A-list customer.  But they remember my dog every time.  \n\nThe only reason I didn't rate them with 5 stars is because my dog seems absolutely petrified of the place.  It's not like she has the heart of a warrior anyway, but I can never leave her there with 100% confidence as she's usually lunging away from the handler and screaming like a banshee.  That may not have anything to do with Club K9 or its employees, but I just couldn't give it the full 5 stars.  It's my dogs fault, (I told you she was a bitch.)\n\nI've had to call and ask them twice to stay 5 minutes after hours so that I could come grab my dog before their doors close on Sunday.  And while they obviously don't like to, they've stayed both times.  Gotta love that.\n\nI'd recommend them to anyone.",1
1203,We recently debated if you'd come back to a place for good food but bad service or bad food and great service. Answer found here - service doesn't win out over bad food. Too salty. Ckn tacos were limp greasy tortillas filled with mashed bland chicken - looked like baby food. Rice dreadful. Chimichanga the size of a small enchilada. Do people really wait in line in so phx for this?  Too many good alternatives to come here twice.  And we're usually pretty forgiving...,0
1204,"What is GOING on with the 3.5 stars here??\n\nTried more than once, seemed to get worse each time.\n\nAll the servers said \""""Oohh, the Chinese food is GREAT!  So authentic, gotta try some!\""""  \n\nWe were skeptical (1) because of the name, duh!  and (2) because our first (AND SECOND) meal here was garbage!  Sadly, we didn't learn.  \n\nWe reasoned that since the American food we ordered the days before had been so bad, perhaps the cooks are Chinese and know how to do that better?  WRONG!  Where's Panda Express when you need one, sheeze.  I'd rather fast dinner and head to the strip for a yummy breakfast in the morning:(\n\n\nOh, I get it now... most of the good reviews are for being CHEAP and OPEN LATE from apparent drunkards, nice.",0
1205,"I have not stayed here yet but that is my next goal. I love to eat here and gamble,  this hotel is so beautiful. I have gambled here b4 but i would enter from Fremont St and exit the same way this time we walked the entire hotel i was surprised that they let us roam the pool area, as we were not guest and anyone thats been to Vegas knows how most will not let u in certain areas, but we asked the guy stationed at the door if we could go n & take some pic he said sure.The restrooms r huge and always clean. This hotel rivals anyplace on the strip as far as the common areas r concerned, remember i havent seen the rooms yet, the shark and fish tanks the gorgeous decor, plenty of staff at every turn if u need something, and the free drinks while u gamble actually have alcohol in them i.e the rum punch is delicious, the nightclub,The Gold Digger music was da bomb, i didnt know any downtown hotels even had clubs and alot of stores inside if u like to shop. My next review will b after i stay here.",1
1206,"can't see any reason to dine here. The atmosphere was dull, the food ranged from OK to yuck (we tried to send one dish back, but they weren't interested), service was OK but not great, and they close early. Very disappointing. The best part of the experience was spinning the prayer wheels near the entrance, hopefully to spare our party from food poisoning.",0
1207,"Make a reservation! This place is deservedly popular. Everything has quite a kick to it, but they will strip certain menu items of the spices (e.g. Salmon) upon request. \n\nTables are close together and I always end up talking to the coolest people about the food they're eating. \n\nUsually a great experience. Last night our waitress was cold and pushy, which detracted from the typically positive dining experience. Otherwise, I highly recommend Mesa Grill.",1
1208,"Groupon brought us here with $8 to spend last night.  I got the Chocolate malted crunch ice cream sandwiched by homemade chocolate chip pecan cookies!   Yum yum.  Earl isn't much of a dessert person but he could not stop raving about his ice cream sandwich, which was the pistachio ice cream with the chocolate brownie.  Those were $3 each so we had another $2 to spend.  We spent it on 3 cookies and devour those cookies tonight after dinner and they were still chewy and delicious.\n\nWe will be coming back to Sweet Addiction when we are in the Spring Valley area!",1

1212,"First visit to the Yardhouse on a non-home game Sunday...\n\nSurprised at how much business they had at 3 in the afternoon but also encouraged by it.  This must mean the place is pretty good, right?\n\nWe started with two beers out of the 120+ they have on tap.  I had one of the Oktoberfest selections, the Beirweisen, which was light, earthy, and very tasty (especially with a squeeze of lemon).  The Main Man simply had the house Hefeweisen and reported it to be nutty, full bodied, and smooth.\n\nWe sampled some nachos (of course we did, the MM has to have nachos if they are on the menu) and they were very good, just about like we make 'em at home!  Momma had to dive in and swim around in the lobster, crab, and spinach dip... So much so that she cordoned off half the order and declared it would be placed atop her order of (Mac n Cheese)2... And really, I can't blame her, it was good shit!\n\nYou know what Momma ate for lunch and all I can say is that she gave me her rolling eyeballs and strange chewing smile that I think might be the same face she gives up during an orgasm.  So while its nice to know she enjoys the food, it's disconcerting at the same time.  \n\nMM had the burger with green chili and pepper jack and it was very, very, very good!  How can one go wrong with a whole, firm, grilled Hatch green chili sitting atop lean Angus on a fall day?\n\nI had the Surf n Turf burger sans bun and I think I'm happy I eschewed the bun.  The asparagus is the perfect compliment to the full sized chunks of crab and lobster sitting on the Angus like a beauty queens crown!  \n\nOur server was friendly, warm, and polite.  She made sure we never wanted for anything... Thank you!\n\nUnfortunately, we were too stuffed to even ponder desert, but we will be back and their molten lava cake is firmly in my sights!",1
1213,"The Jean Philippe Patisserie in Bellagio has a Chocolate-fantasy like theme, where you can see the largest chocolate fountain in the world.

They are quite pricey but well worth it.",1

Couldn't have recorded the relatively low score without them. We only had to wait for other foursome playing in front us. One of the guys is kind of a prick, so no surprise there. Otherwise we moved pretty well.\n\nHaving played at the Ocean Course, Pebble Beach, and Sawgrass, I can't quite put this course in the same 5 star echelon, but close. Then again, it doesn't cost as much to play as these courses, so maybe some value there.",1
1215,"Fantastic place to stay. The only downside would be that it might be a bit costly for most people (I'm no exception). Nonetheless, I suppose it is to be expected for a hotel in Vegas.

1217,"Came here a couple weeks ago and enjoyed the experience immensely...except for the wait, of course. We didn't have a reservation, so hung out at the bar and had drinks for about 45 minutes. We weren't in a hurry so it was fine, but if you want to sit immediately, make reservations...and make them well in advance.\n\nOn to the food (which - let's be real - is what we all care about). We ordered:\n\n- Cheese & Charcuterie Plate: We went with the Fennel Salami, VSOP Gouda and the Mobay, all of which were yummy (the Fennel cheese is very Fennel-y so if you don't like Fennel...you've been warned). I will say that I felt their meats/cheeses were outrageously expensive (I compare them to what I can get at Good Food on Montford, which are similarly delicious and you get twice the goods for slightly more than what B&G's charging). I know, I know, quality over quantity...I just don't think I'm enough of a meat/cheese connoisseur to think what they're charging was worth it. That said, we still enjoyed them.\n\n- The B&G Burger (their signature burger grind): I went pretty mainstream with my entr\u00e9e choice, and was not disappointed...from the moment they sat that burger in front of me with its little \""""B&G\"""" branded bun, I was a happy camper. Burger was cooked perfectly, bun was great, fires were great...it was great. Did I mention it was great?\n\n- Sides of Pan Fried Corn, Brussels Sprouts, Mac & 3 Cheese: In my opinion, these were easily stars of the show. These aren't particularly inventive or crazy sides, you see them (in various forms) on lots of menus...but what set them apart was the execution. They were all just perfection. My mouth is watering just thinking about how great each of them were...makes me desperately want to try to the rest of the sides. Could I get a meal of just sides? I kid, I kid...sort of...\n\nI can't exactly remember what my boyfriend ordered...I think I was too enamored with my food to care. A steak or something that I'm sure was amazing. \n\nWell done, B&G...well done. Slash the prices on your meats and cheeses, but otherwise, keep up the good work.\n\nP.S. they have corkage ($15 fee, which in my book isn't horrible - but then I'm from L.A. so take it with a grain of salt).",1
1218,"Today I ordered a large vanilla cone and paid for it the person at the counter  said \""""That'll be right up for you.\"""" Well it wasn't right up and I waited for 20 minutes before they finally got around to making it for me.

1220,"I don't know if it was an off night, but the food was very disappointing. Especially considering the price of the food!  The appetizers were good and service exceptional. The main course, foie gras, was under cooked and all of the presentation beforehand was elegant for show, but the food still has to taste good. In my opinion, this is a very, very over priced French restaurant that is trying to add modern gastronomic flare...fail. I would rather go to Alinea for the real thing.   I had a much better culinary experience at a much cheaper restaurant called TAO. For people who are in the culinary field or eat high quality food frequently, go somewhere else and save your money...lots of money!!!!",0

1223,"I was so excited to try this place! I dragged my sisters and boyfriend here for lunch... Highly disappointed:( I love soup and was eager to try all the soups they had... I ordered the mushroom bisque after having samples of the lobster and cauliflower. Needless to say, I prefer Campbell's mushroom soup from the can. I got the pick 2 combo, turkey bacon avocado. Again, first bite I was disappointed. For some reason, the sandwich was sweet? I asked for regular yellow mustard, and when I opened my sandwich the bread looked like it was drizzled with honey. I literally took a few bites and called it quits. My boyfriend and sisters, also not impressed. Only thing my boyfriend liked was the sauce they used on his Italian club. I did enjoy the complimentary chocolate covered strawberry though. Definitely made the lunch better. Sadly, I will not be returning. I'll stick to canned soup and homemade sandwiches or Panera Bread.",0

I called ahead and it was all ready when I came to pick it up 15 minutes later. The lady was nice but I guess decided to jack up the price $2 from the menu. I didn't say anything, but actions spoke louder than words and I left no tip. The restaurant is FILLED with cans of food all over, so obviously nothing is fresh. Gross. \n\nI decided to not let the experience at the restaurant ruin it for me so I went home with an open mind, hoping to find a treasure. Well all I found was junk. The noodles were slimy and had a weird thick gooey sauce (from a can) smothered all over it. My one piece of broccoli could hardly mark it as a vegetable dish, so they added a pound of cabbage. I don't mind cabbage but that is not what I ordered and it is a very cheap substitute for a plate full of real veggies. \n\nI will never be going back. I will though continue my search for good food in Henderson! Wish me luck...",0
1225,"This review is for their Lounge. \n\nI was walking with my group from Diablo Cantina to The Bellagio, and one of their many promoters on the street convinced us to go to Brand. I have stayed at the Monte Carlo before, and I did not even know they had a lounge. Anyways, he confirmed with us it would be $20 bucks each. He even walked us to the line. We saw that the line was a little long, but he assured us it would only be about a five minute wait. After a while in line I noticed that the only reason it was getting shorter, was because people were leaving the front of the line. Someone from the back of the line yelled at the hostess monitoring the line and told her that they were spewing lies, but some how we did not connect the dots. When we got through the rope, the girl working the line told us it would be $30 each. We confronted her and told her the name of the promoter that told us it would be $20. She did not even consider this, and goes on and on about how it was technically Saturday night, and now we had to pay the \""""weekend\"""" price. Naturally, we left. \n\nEither the staff had NO sufficient communication, or they were just building up a line in order to get people to come to their obscure lounge.\n\nI'm sure it must be a lovely restaurant.",0
1226,"I've hated this place since it was a BP.  And even though the name has changed, nothing else has.\n\nThis place is by far the worst of the worse.  This particular one is located at a very busy intersection where five roads meet.  So just picture that when attempting to enter/exit this place.  And to speak of the overcrowding of this tiny lot isn't even worth it.  \n\nThe tiny store that goes along with this place is as much of a joke as you can imagine.  They have attempted to shove as much as they could in here to make it look like a typical GetGo.  Right down to the ATM.  Save your time and drive a few more miles to a different gas station, you'll surely save a headache by doing so.",0
1227,Place isn't worth it. Went there about a week ago. Thought it was going to be a great time. Well I was wrong! Took 20 mins to just get drinks. Once we ordered we literally did not see our waiter till the last 30 mins of the showing and I had to remind her again that I haven't got anything. Whenever I pressed the button nobody would come. When I found another waiter they said they would be back and never returned. I don't know what's up with this place. We finally got the food literally 15 mins before it ended. Just terrible. Never going back.,0

In Canada, we have only a tiny number of Victoria's secret locations, and the one location in Toronto takes me 45 min on the subway to get to. Plus, there is nothing better than going in half drunk on casino drinks and getting fitted. (As I am sure this is a regular occasion, and I am sure I stank like booze, I feel bad for the girls)\n\nReally helpful, friendly staff, and a huge selection. They always have which bra I would like, in my size, in the colour I want. Plus, with close proximity to the strip and casino fun, Its easy to lure boyfriend into this direction. Being semi-feuled on casino drinks himself, he doesn't seem as uncomfortable waiting for me to finish shopping. \n\nLove Victoria's Secret. Really no other bras fit as well, and offer so many comfortable options. Extra Star for getting to shop while buzzed, and it not being taboo.",1
1231,"My boyfriend and I have gone to this place several times and really enjoy sitting at the sushi bar.  The food is consistently good. The reason for the 2 stars is the poor customer service. We normally order one saki bomber.  The menu says $6.50 but when you order, the server offers a large beer without mentioning this \""""penny\"""" beer special so then we are charged 11.50 for the 6.50 menu bomber.   We talked to the server twice and nothing was done. If you are going to run a great beer special then offer it to your customers.  There are a couple of other sushi restaurants in the area that offer better food along with good customer service and who promote their specials.  Not going back to this place again.",0
1232,"\""""Hotdogs are made out of pig buttholes,\"""" my dad told me when I was eight. Needless to say I didn't eat another for over a decade and we've had a tense relationship ever since. But thanks to the gourmet hotdog movement of 2004, I've ventured out to try them every few months or so.\n\nEnter Haute Doggery- located in the LINQ, touting Kobe-beef dogs with gourmet toppings. I opted for the Fun-ghi Dog, menu description: a char-grilled frank with grilled mushrooms, caramelized onions, truffle mayo and shredded Gruyere cheese.\n\nIt arrived covered in cheese, which was fine with me since I love cheese. But I quickly discovered that the cheese was a blanket of deception, meant to hide the fact that my $9 hotdog had a scant four mushrooms on it and so few onions as to seem missing or forgotten.\nOh, and I highly doubt that these are made with Kobe anything- and even if they are, their cooking method renders the quality of product useless. Listed on menu as grilled, it tasted boiled and lightly seared (which explains how it was ready in 3 minutes) and had ZERO snap. And the bun was unremarkable other than it being broken in two pieces before it reached my mouth. \n\nPet peeve: receipt for walk-up restaurant has a tip line, but there is virtually no service provided. Even when there are only 3 people in the restaurant, order is called out when ready instead of walked out to the customer. Kind of tacky.",0
1233,"Since it has opened, Monsoon Siam has quickly become one of my favorites in the area, and it's now on my regular visit rotation. Although their service is good, the staff is nice, and the prices are reasonable, I keep coming back here for two main reasons: The dishes, and how fast they come to the table.\n\nConcerning the food: There's a lot more variety on the menu than one would expect. Some of the specials are interesting and unique concoctions, like the lemongrass tofu and tofu angel. Otherwise, there's a lot of classics to choose from as well, like the Pad Thai, and the selection of curries. One aspect I really like is that in the dishes where you can choose your protein, you can pick a tofu BALL, which is different from your regular old tofu in that it's deep-fried and packed with herbs. I very much recommend trying those at least once.\n\nAnd all of this food comes to you FAST. Like I put in an order with 1 other person, and the dishes came to us in 4 minutes. It's almost too fast, because it makes me wonder if they're even made to order. But they're delicious regardless, so who cares? The speed of the service always makes me consider Monsoon Siam when i'm in a pinch for time and am feeling too lazy to cook.\n\nWith all that said, I can say that even if you think that there's too many Thai places in Madison, Monsoon Siam is still well worth your time to check out.",1
1234,"Thanks to all you reviewers- I found Shampoo Ink on yelp....and SO GLAD I did!!!  Kelly transformed my flat, lifeless uber-long 1 length dark blonde hair into a work of art- with bright blonde and purple highlights ombre-style with long layers and side-swept bangs.  She even styled it for me for an event I was going to the next day.  My hair got lots of compliments.  Kelly was meticulous with the color, cut and style.  She took her time and stayed an hour after closing to make sure I was thrilled with the result.  She gave me lots of tips for styling and maintaining the health of my hair.  She was a lot of fun to spend 4+ hours with and very professional.  The cost of everything she did to my hair was an absolute steal.  The vibe of the salon is creative and artsy without being impossibly hipster.  I loved every part of my experience.  I'll definitely be back!",1

Music (and I am really a Beatles fan) and audio is loud in a good way.

Their baba ganouj and falafel are some of the best I've tried! The falafel is perfectly crispy and fresh, not overdone. I often go here for takeout because they are so quick and reliable. If I do takeout I usually get a rolled pita with hummus or baba and tabouli. My parents love this place as well. My only slight complaint is that sometimes it is a little cold with the AC, but I just have to remember to take a sweater and then I'm fine. The outside seating is also very nice on a summer day!",1

Our server suggested the Southside to start, and I was intrigued. They only make 15 large jars per day of this drink, so I decided to take advantage of this special drink. It's just beefeater, fresh lemon juice, and mint. Super delicious. Super refreshing. Of course I ordered a second drink. My friend had the pub's version of a moscow mule, and loved it. \n\nWe shared the fried pickles, which were perfectly crispy and not greasy at all, and our server recommended the Greek salad and I was requesting \""""lighter\"""" fare.

He responded by saying well if you don't like it call another cab, which I did. 45 minutes later, the next cab came, however this ended up with us stuck in rush hour traffic, which in turn made me miss my flight. After calling the company, they mentioned to me that he was suspended for 24hrs, but there was nothing they could do about me missing my flight and having to pay another $700 to get a new ticket.

I was thinking- maybe they dont serve it becuase the meats too expensive- but then; there was tons of people in there so how can they NOT afford the meat when Filibertos has it??  Lots of cars in the parking lot and after we ordered it took like 20 minutes for our 1 BURRITO and 5 rolled taquitos/flautas... Im sorry- but that's way too long for simple taco truck orders.

I stumbled across Bounce and Rebound and was a little unsure of what service to expect as I could find no prior reviews.  BAM!!  They hit it out of the park.  The owners always answer the phone in-person (don't have to wait for a call-back), they suggested the best slide (Fire and Ice), and handled all of the contract and scheduling via their web-site.  A simple, yet forgotten, courtesy of service providers is an advance phone call notifying us that the set-up man was on the way to our house.   Colton called 15 minutes prior and actually arrived a tad EARLY to the promised time.  The 13 teenagers all went crazy with the Fire and Ice water slide and had a blast.   They have already requested the same slide for next year and of course we will be calling Bounce and Rebound.  This is a monster large slide, yet Colton did all of the set-up and take down with no issues.   Highly recommended.",1
1250,"For my 500th review, I thought about writing about beaches in San Diego, art centers in Los Angeles, cafes in New Mexico, or bookstores in Boston.  But it seemed right to focus on the Mass Transit District of Champaign-Urbana, the bus system that keeps my life in order.  \n\nI moved a month ago to Chambana, and it has quickly become apparent that I do not live in Southern California any more.  The land is flat, the wind comes sweeping through, the place is smaller in scope, and I'm rapidly realizing that I'm not going to want to rely on my car when the snow falls from the sky.\n\nEnter Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District.\n\nThere's no need for a parking permit when there are countless, continuously running lines covering the entire area.  My weekday mornings find me checking my house, looking through my backpack, making sure all my stuff is in order, before frantically hustling down the street in order to catch the 13 Silver South Line to campus, which runs twice an hour.  \n\nIf I'm worried about catching the bus, the MTD has a text messaging service, where you can text the bus line with a number and get real time information for when the bus is arriving.  Let me tell you, a text message has saved me more than once from missing the last bus before class starts.:)\n\nThe website is unfortunately abbreviated (http://www.cumtd.com), but wonderfully comprehensive.  I've had generally great luck with the drivers on the 5, 10, 13, and 7, and I'm really glad to have made it to a place with really accessible, constant, reliable mass transit.  I'm slightly less worried about gas prices, as it's free for university students to ride the ever-present CUMTD system.:)\n\nIn short, thank you so much, Chambana MTD for getting me where I need to go all the time, every time.",1

1258,"I was in the area for lunch and noticed this place. I was in need of a birthday present for my nephews upcoming 2nd birthday. This is normally something my better half would handle but as I mentioned I was in the area and noticed this place and didn't think it would be so hard. I was wrong and will forever gladly let my wife buy all children related things in the future if this is how it all goes down. \n\nFirst when I walk in the place was chaos. Kids were running all over and books and toys were scattered everywhere. I felt very cramped and the store just seemed dirty. There was only 1 woman working and she said she was the owner. I explained that I don't usually do this sort of thing and told her what I was looking for. I asked her if she had a couple things that were educational and fun for a 2 year old. She then went on to tell me the store was \""""her baby and her livelihood\"""" even though I absolutely never asked. She said they offered a service where parents can drop off their kids at her store to be watched while they shop. Serious? Parents are really doing this? The store isn't very big and they just have half of it stuffed with a bunch of overpriced toys and the other half has baby gates closing a section off where parents can leave their kids. Since the kids were running wild and screaming and she appeared to have no help, I asked her if she needed to tend to them while I looked around. She said \""""oh, 4 of them are mine and only 1 is a drop in so it's OK\"""". NO it's NOT OK! How can this lady work a storefront AND watch 5 kids. I would hope if some of them were hers that they would be better behaved to represent her business better. I was just wanting to get out of there so I grabbed 2 items and got the hell out of there. \n\nWhen my wife got home and saw what I picked out she was actually impressed with my purchase until she saw the price I paid. \""""don't you know Melissa & Doug is a brand and you can get that stuff cheaper on ebay\"""". Dang I already felt out of place doing this whole thing to begin with and now I'm getting annoyed by 2 woman! She went online and indeed found the same 2 items cheaper by $20 including shipping. $20 bucks is $20 bucks right?

1261,"I tried out this place, like many, earlier today (between 4:30 - 5:30) due to the effusively positive reviews here. Unfortunately since my experience was so out of whack with what I've read I decided I would christen Alamo Hand Car Wash with my first Yelp review.\n\nI chose an exterior/interior clean + seat shampoo package for $59.95. The array of options they offer is vast: everything from a simple exterior wash to waxing and detailing. Though I was tempted to splurge and go for the full monty at $120+, the issues I had with the lesser package alone made me glad I went small as a trial.\n\nAfter about an hour the car was unveiled as finished. As I walked around inspecting it one guy from the crew remained, doing touch-ups. The manager was also there beside me as I looked. Everything looked fine until I got to the front. When I peered inside the driver door I noticed the steering wheel appeared untouched, marred still by the unsightly ring of grime it had when I brought it in. I pointed it out to the manager and asked if they'd cleaned it, knowing the answer already. He said something to the crew member, who grumbled in annoyance (something about being unable to clean it) as he sat back into the car and scrubbed the steering wheel. \n\nAs he cleaned it the manager first said they only used Windex to avoid tarnishing the metallic Mazda seal with chemicals. Then he started talking about how they used an all-purpose cleaner. I believe the cleaner was what the worker used AFTER I mentioned it. The manager said the black finish of the steering wheel made it so the stains would reappear--he claimed they already cleaned it--and that he was having the worker do it again just to show me. But wouldn't you know, the steering wheel is back to its pristine roots. It's a result that I'm unsurprised with considering I've successfully used Armor All wipes to clean it in the past.\n\nDriving away I noticed a few other blemishes left over. My center console has three spots of... something... (pictured) that definitely weren't there before. I've taken a cleaning wipe and fingernail to them to no avail. My rear view and side view mirrors have water spots. The rear view mirror also has a couple prominent smudges. Besides the steering wheel they didn't touch the driving stick either. I had to follow up my $60 car wash with a cleaning wipe (also pictured).\n\nI'm rating them 1 star for two reasons: \n\n1) It's ridiculous that the most visible portions of the car for a customer were neglected. There's no excuse for not doing the steering wheel. It's what's staring me in the face when I get in my car. \n\nAnd most importantly,\n\n2) The spots on my console (damage, essentially, judging by the difficulty I've had so far in removing them).\n\nI would be open to revising my rating if they corrected these issues next time and removed the stains they put in my car.",0

They obviously support Yelp, which means Yelpers must support them.  \n\nWe walked in around 9pm, so it was only about half full.  We took a seat at the bar and ordered two glasses of wine.  The wine is all reasonably priced.  We ordered the Margherita pizza and added mushrooms (which might be a crime against humanity in Italy but that's how we like it).  We also spilt a salad to share.  The pizza was perfectly cooked.  Unlike some other Neapolitan pizza joints, this pizza had an even char across the entire pie.  It was an amazing pizza and you could tell that all the ingredients were the absolute best quality.  The bartender and our server for the evening, David, was making a delicious looking martini with hibiscus and peach schnapps so I went ahead and ordered one for myself as well.  I don't remember what it was called (the first glass of wine had already gone to my head) but it was one heck of a great martini.  For dessert, we ordered the cr\u00e8me brulee which came with strawberries and raspberries on top.  It had amazing vanilla bean flavor and you could see the flecks of vanilla bean in the custard.  \n\nI have to say that the service from David definitely put this place over the top in terms of quality for us.  Give that man a raise!",1
1264,"A & A Traders is one of a number of shops in Edinburgh which seems to sell almost anything you need for you home! The shop is crammed full of home ware goods and gardening items. \n\nThis shop reminded me of the Edinburgh Bargain Store in Newington, however, this shop is smaller and seems to be struggling to modernise itself. Now, don't get me wrong, these kinds of shops are very handy to have in the city if you don't want to travel to a retail park to visit a Homebase or B & Q. However, just along Easter Road there is a B & Q, so you would most likely get what you need there than from this shop. \n\nWith just looking at the window display you can tell this shop is stuck in time. It advertises that it sells Video Tapes and its windows are full of clutter that no one is really going to need to buy (Including that dodgy yellow coloured kettle). \n\nNot the best home ware shop I have been in to, there are many other similar shops which are better, but this shop is still a handy place to buy that odd item you need!",0
1265,"This restaurant helps to provide some Asian food variety to the Champaign-Urbana area. While the food isn't great, most of the dishes are relatively solid. The banh mi is really the best choice over here and I'd say the pho was probably my least favorite. It's not that easy to find Vietnamese food in most of the midwest though (outside of big cities and some campus towns) so it's nice to have a solid choice.",1
1266,"DON'T GIVE THIS PLACE YOUR BUSINESS.. I shall explain\n\nI am a officer in the military and looking for a place to take my platoon for a camaraderie dinner on myself. I walked inside this restaurant and asked for a menu then proceeded to ask \""""What kind of food would be New Mexican Food\"""" The guy working the front just said \""""its from...You know...The state of New Mexico\"""" in a very rude and cocky tone as if I was a 2 year old. I handed him the menu then left. I have never once eaten at this location and will continue to never eat there..EVER",0
1267,"I love to laugh! I really had no idea this place existed and probably would have never found it had it not been for the Groupon I bought. I just seen Stand-Up and Comedy Club and bought it without even noticing it was in Scottsdale. No worries though. \n\nOur only problem with the night was it was kind of confusing what was going on for a first timer. We got there close to the 9:00 pm start time and walked into this big room that I guess was a bar area where everyone had to wait. There was a sort of line to walk into the seating area but after asking people in this line what it was for, they weren't sure either lol! \n\nOnce they started letting people in it was great from there. Abby and I got a nice intimate table, we didn't have to share it and weren't crowded in. They had several local comedians before the headliner and the locals hella impressed me. One did a song on the guitar that was hilarious. The MC did a great job keeping the show along. \n\nAlso there was a crazy, obnoxious bachelorette party that sat right in front, talked the whole time and basically all acted a foo. This was easy material for all the comedians and I felt like it was an extra treat that most people don't get to see. \n\nOur waitress did a great job taking care of us, I was a little disappointed that the dessert I really wanted was not available that night but other than that drinks and food were a-okay! \n\nIt ended up being the start to a great night in Old Town. I'll keep my eye on their lineup and hope to be back here again sometime soon.",1
1268,"Wow.  We came here as a fluke, simply because it was the only restaurant in the area that had a table on Friday at 7:00.  And what a happy fluke it was because WOW was that a good meal.\n\nThe service was amazing- absolutely top notch and entirely faultless.\n\nThe food... wow.  We opted for the sharing platter to start which was amazing.  The tempura was perfect - light, crunchy and not greasy.  The ribs were the star, though, loaded with meat and SO GOOD.  \n\nI had the shrimp pad thai as my main which was loaded with shrimp and had two massive shrimp butterflied on the side which were absolutely fantastic.  The Man had a duck dish which he loved.  I was too busy eating my own food to pay attention to his.  \n\nOur wine - a Californian Zinfandel- was also fantastic and at \u00a315.95, a steal compared to restaurants we've visited lately.  \n\nWe were hugely impressed and absolutely can't wait to return.",1
1269,"Just terrible.\n\nSign outside says $5 drafts - night special, Tilted Kilt night.  Great, we say!  We'd love a happy hour draft on a hot day.\n\nWe walk in, find a seat at the crowded bar, and order two Miller Lites.\n\nBill comes, and we're charged $16.  What!?  I ask, he tells me the $5 is for industry night, and only applies to those in industry.  What does that even mean?  I say the sign does not say that, and he argues it does.  I go out to the sign three times to confirm, and every time tell him it does not.\n\nHe says, well you're wrong, but because you're causing an issue, I will just charge you $10.  Of course you will, because I am not wrong (and, isn't the customer always right anyways?), and you really should check your signs, and honor them.  Maybe most of the people that come in here have really taken Vegas to the extreme so do not notice the bill, but that's just dishonest business.\n\nNever again in this location.  Never again in any location.",0
1270,"I really wanted to give this place a good review, but, alas, I can't. I have been there only twice, but I doubt my stomache will allow me to return.....The first time, I ordered the steak sub, got sick and thought it was just me...Went back last week to give it another shot, again, ordered the steak with mushrooms (which Pop's claim ALL their ingredients are fresh...nope! CANNED mushrooms..YUCK!) And now here I am 2 DAYS LATER still throwing up. Tried to email them, yet their email is INACTIVE! SUPER EXPENSIVE! The only thing I enjoyed was the smart mouth of the \""""Grill Master\"""" Steve S. Will spend my money at Port of Subs before I return.....",0
1271,"Nice friendly breakfast and lunch place. Donuts, breakfast and lunch meals, etc. OK so its in a strange little mini mall, but the food pretty good and the staff is friendly and personable.\n\nFor $5, I got a very large egg burrito and a drink. I enjoyed it and would go back if in the neighborhood.",1
1272,"I know that it is hard to go wrong finding a good restaurant in Montreal, but some places are just better than others.\n\nA co-worker, who lives in Montreal, took me here on a Tuesday night.  He told me that we would likely never get in on a weekend night.  Based on the food, I can see why.\n\nThe location is in Old Montreal, which can have touristy places than border on bad food.  The decor is also not quite as fancy as the four $$$$ that Yelp lists this place.  \n\nIn fact, I would not call this a $$$$ place.  The menu changes quite a bit, but there were plenty of meals under $40.\n\nService was helpful and attentive.  Recommendations on wine, entrees and dessert were excellent:\n-Wine list is good... heavy on French and European - with lots of price points covered.\n-I had a simple mescalin salad with dressing.  Other than the fact that it was enough for two, it was a great start to the meal.\n-My dining companion had the tartar mixed with beets.  He said the beets gave it an interesting flavor and texture.\n-I had the scallops.  Presentation was beautiful and the various textures/flavors were to die for.\n-Finally, we shared Chocolate Bavarois.  There has never been a better combination of cocoa!\n\nThe last point I would like to make on this excellent establishment is that the chef must like foie gras.  I counted no less than 6 menu items that contained it.  The amuse bouche had it.  My scallops were flavored with it.  At the beginning of the meal, we remarked that we thought the butter was flavored with it (it isn't - it was simply butter with olives in it).  This chef really knows how to cook!",1
1273,"I use the Tri-centre mainly because they have cyclocross specific knowledge, are near my house and have a coffee shop attached, but also because they are a friendly helpful bunch who know their sports. \n\nSeveral times I've been in and they've recommended kit and I have not been disappointed. I really feel you get good value for money when shopping at your LBS (local bike shop) rather than ordering online. They will quite often recommend you DONT buy the most expensive, rather buy the item that's best for you. All the guys in there are racers and therefore know their nutrition as well, but in the sense that they will recommend based on personal experience. I prefer this to someone saying \""""THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER\"""". Different things work for different people. They do stock Stinger gels (until they sell out!) which I know some people lose their s*** over. I find them a bit sickly but each to their own! \n\nThey stock LOADS of Triathlon stuff and I would recommend anyone starting out popping in to get stoked about all the lovely kit you could own. I certainly try to pop in from time to time to encourage saving my pennies to buy a decent bike. \n\nI think they also do kit rental if you're not sure what you want to buy. \n\nThey are also a shop that gets involved. They run swimming sessions in lochs regularly through the summer helping people get used to open water swimming. They also sponsored and ran a race at dunbar in the scottish cyclocross series which was a triumph. It was an absolutely brilliant course and provided hundreds of people a fantastic day out. \n\nAll in all I recommend checking them out. Remember with a specialist shop or your LBS  you get much more than just what you're buying. You get advice, an experience, and usually - much less hassle if something breaks or needs to be returned. You'd miss them if they weren't there!",1
1274,"I'm in love with this place. It's just got amazing energy. Great music, good (although expensive) drinks, good people, go-go dancers, crazy light show, etc.\n\nI started out with a Beer which I believe was $6, and then switched to mixed drinks which were $11. On my second vodka Redbul I asked for double and the bar tender gave it to me for the same $11 price as the single so that was sweet. Also had a great gin and tonic. Service is slow though, lots of folks and the bar tenders aren't in a rush. They are however pretty nice once they get around to you. The place is filled with chairs and couches, but people also kinda get up and dance in the empty space (although there is no real dance floor). I actually found that somewhat appealing, it takes what little formality there is in club dancing and makes it completely casual. Most folks were in club attire (dressed and button up shirts), but there were a few folks dressed down a bit and that didn't seem to be a problem (there is no bouncer). The music that night was also super dope. Chris Cutz was in from San Diego and absolutely melted faces. Right song at the right time every time, lots of bass, and hard beats. Their sound system in general is of pretty good quality.",1
1275,"For a Sunday night, this place was crackin! A group of us rolled in after dinner at RA and found the party. It was not too busy to be able to order a drink and their bar was more than amply staffed. They have an army of attendants ready to sweep up broken glass, pick up finished drinks, and manage the bathroom lines and cleanliness. The DJ was playing a great (and fair) mix of hip-hop, top 40 and house/dance music. There was a $5 cover, which I thought was fair considering how heavily staffed they were and how relatively reasonably priced their cocktails were. A nice plus was that we were able to secure a free table opposite from the bar. Great view of the VIP and the floor. Whenever I'm in Scottsdale, I always enjoy having a few drinks here.",1
1276,"I know, I know... why the hell review Kazimierz? Hasn't everyone reviewed it already? Yes.. but I can't help it. It's sentimental. I've had some of my *best* dates here. And it's where I met my husband!\nSo deal with it, people.\n\nLove the atmosphere. Even when you walk in, it smells like tannins (or is that dirty leather? Well, whatever). It always feels dark and earthy and romantic.\nI always get the fondue, which is pretty good. \n\nThe best time to go here is NOT on the weekend nights. Sundays, Thursdays, any other days, they will often have live jazz or blues. Tonight I got to hear jazzy Christmas music, which was great. The weekends, however, can be lame, as they charge you for... absolutely nothing, other than walking in the door.\n\nWhy not five stars? Well, the long line for the bathrooms. AND the fact that, in spite of being a wine bar, many of the wines aren't that good. I was all excited to try one of the flights they have with Armenian and Lebanese wines. But they weren't actually that good. Some of the other wines I've tasted have just been mediocre.\nOne exception? The zinfandel I had tonight. Something from Mortenson \""""dry creek.\"""" Can't remember the actual name of it because, well, I had too many glasses of it...but it was delicious! Spicy and warm and with a finish that reminded me of... marshmallows? I know that description won't make it into Wine Spectator or anything, but honestly, it was awesome!",1
1277,"Eggstasy restaurant is finally open! Had a nice, BIG, breakfast there this morning, just to be sure.  The hash browns are the best, nice mix of crunch and generous seasoning for excellent flavor. The Benedict with crispy prosciutto was recommended by my server and was a great selection, prosciutto was thinly sliced and cooked up like bacon, only crispier, and smokier. The poached egg (just the very teensiest, slightest bit underdone) and hollandaise (very lemony, yum!), over a monster of an English muffin from a local bakery. Portions were HUGE - half of my Bene and most of the hash browns are in the fridge for tomorrow. Service was excellent! Hostess, waiter (Junior), co-owner/manager, and water servers were very attentive, friendly, anxious to please, and delighted to share all the details on anything related to the menu or local restaurant biz. Like that the terrific and spongy English muffin came from Strictly From Scratch bakery, who are also the suppliers for Scramble and recently bought Chompie's. Who knew?\nCan't wait to return and try some of the funky crepes and omelets on offer!\nAlso:  Coffee is strong and good and plentiful, but needs to come with a spoon for stirring in cream.",1
1278,"We've been here plenty of times before and it seems like its always crowded no matter what time or day.  The food is good and what I especially like is the unlimited soup or salad. In addition, the breadsticks are great and my 4 year old daughter can attest to this. \n\nThe entrees here are very good and I know I'm going to get shunned for saying this but I'm not a big cheese eater. I come here due to my wife loving Italian food. Nevertheless I still love it here due to the breadsticks, spaghetti and soup.\n\nI hope this review helps and Happy Eating!",1
1279,AWFUL SERVICE.  There is a major communication gap.  I cannot place a to go order over the phone.  The employee does not know her own menu.  The place itself does not seem tidy and was quite unorganized.  Clear furniture is a bad idea if you do not plan on cleaning it often.,0

1281,"I've been ordering from Rosati's for decades. I found them in Chicago and was overjoyed to find them again in Fountain Hills, AZ. However, the FH store has messed up my order on multiple occasions. They did so again last night when they failed to put cheese on my half of the pizza and then burnt it. When I called to let them know I was told there was a note on my account that I \""""complained too much\"""" and they would no longer serve me. So apparently the business model isn't to get the orders right but to cut off service to the customer if they rightly complain that the pizza is not done correctly.  They also claimed my husband was \""""threatening\"""" when he returned another incorrectly done pizza and he said he was going to inform corporate of the terrible service. Do not walk, run away from this terribly run franchise and get your pizza from a completely different Rosati's location.",0
1282,"Once a month my girlfriends and I get together for a long overdue \""""Girls' Night\""""!! This month we had the pleasure of trying out Baku, which is centrally located on Sharon Rd. across from South Park Mall. \n\nUn-freaking-believable!!! There was something for everyone, I'm not kidding!! We decided to start with a few sushi and sashimi dishes to share while we discussed wine and sake options with our server, whom I might add was charming, accommodating, friendly, and overall extremely helpful and patient with all of our questions. He picked out a few bottles of sake for our table to share based on listening to our likes and dislikes, delicious! \n\nNext, we decided to continue our experience with some skewers (the pork belly are to die for) and some small bites (2 words: roasted oysters). As new food came, so did new plates, the staff definitely made us feel as if they too, wanted us to have an amazing experience. We tried everything! We ended our meal with surf and turf and vegetable courses, including the spicy filet, lamb chops, duck, Madagascar prawn (you have to see this thing!), black cod, salmon, grilled baby artichokes, and portobello mushrooms. \n\nWe were so stuffed after trying so many delicious items, we almost passed on dessert.... J/k!! We decided to share the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, mango toffee cake, and assorted sorbets.

1283,"My review is only on their Acai Bowls, which is NOT real acai bowls. It is basically a acai smoothie with the various toppings. I watched them pour in acai juice into the blender with banana and ice...when in other places they blend pure frozen acai puree resulting in rich purple color and taste of acai. What I got was just a diluted acai juice smoothie. They also serve it up in a cup rather than a bowl. Needless to say, it was a disappointment and a waste of money for $7.",0
1284,"Though staff seems friendly, they are not knowledgeable about shipping valuable things, how insuring a package works and completely overpriced. \n\nI used their services to ship a sewing machine. They charge $25 to put it in a box and wrap it with bubble tape.  I was charged $136 for postage and insurance (though not enough insurance to cover the machine if it broke while shipping because she didn't know how).  I felt that I was paying way too much but was in a time crunch so I accepted and left (did not get an actual copy of any shipping forms because she said she had to keep all copies including the one that says \""""customer copy\""""). \n\nOnce my package arrived my feeling of being overcharged was confirmed.  Of the $136 I paid for postage and insurance, it only really cost $77 to send. Upon contacting the owner, I was told there was no error and the +75% markup was the retail price because they have no affiliation with UPS and thats how they earn money to stay in business.  Had I taken my package to the US Postal Service  up the street at Cave Creek I would have gotten better service and paid over $50 LESS for my shipment. \n\nI would give this store 1 STAR because of my experience and feeling that they are extremely overpriced and \""""shady\"""". I gave it 2 STARS however because the item that I sent, did arrive in 1 piece and in the amount of time I was promised.

This Starbucks was clean, had friendly staff,  and had outlets for me to use- always a plus. Of course, I was lucky they weren't crowed on Saturday afternoon.  There's a nice covered outdoor area to relax and enjoy your purchase as well. If I lived closer, I'd frequent this particular Starbucks.",1
1286,"Of course your average Starbucks fare is here, as at every place across the country. \n\nWhat sets an individual location of a chain like Starbucks apart is the quality of their service and the feel of the store. Both are subpar at this particular spot. Long lines out into the terminal because the store is understaffed, and that leads to abrupt, harried staff who in turn provide an unpleasant experience for the guests. \n\nThere are also unpacked boxes of inventory lining the walls. I know that your bakery items aren't actually fresh-baked, but I like to keep a little mystery alive as to how those pastries end up in the glass case.",0

The service at the casino was good. \n\nWe also did spa during our stay. The spa was expensive, but it was really good. The facilities were well designed and incredible. The spa lobby was quite stunning. \n\nHowever, we had to wait in line pretty much everywhere, oh well, this is Vegas. \n\nAlso, they made a mistake on our spa charge upon check-out.

1290,"I wholeheartedly agree with Mike K. - for your money, this is a great deal in Charlotte. The Dowd Y is a very nice gym that offers a bevy of group fitness classes, up to date (and always functioning) equipment and a super clean atmosphere. \n\nWhy I love this Y in particular...the machines are always in service (and I've head that techs are out fixing them weekly if need be). They also do not allow any children under the age of 16 in the workout areas. Now, don't get me wrong, I love kids, just not when I'm trying to get my sweat on. \n\nAs mentioned before, this Y offers so many great group classes. I'm a big fan of Total Strength, Pilates Mat and Kickboxing. I've also heard the Spin classes are great. I've tried Athletic Conditioning, and while it certainly is an awesome workout, make sure you're at least in decent shape before you partake in that class! It's a rough one. \n\nAs other reviewers have noted, this gym can get packed especially after 5 pm during the weekdays. So be patient while parking. Some classes can get a bit crowded too, so keep that in mind when you're sprawling out your mat or equipment. \n\nI haven't had any issues with theft in the locker room, but I'm a big proponent of a big papa lock on my locker. For the money and the friendly service, the Dowd YMCA is a great deal for anyone looking to slim down or tone up.",1
1291,"I took my niece and nephew here.  I was a little worried about the location and that it would be not as nice as the pictures on the website made it look.  However I was pleasantly surprised.  It was a nice little amusement park located within a large park.  It's free admission, but you pay for the rides.  We got wristbands for the kids as well as one for me, since my niece could not ride everything alone due to her height.\n\nThe kids had a blast going back and fourth from ride to ride.  Their two favorites were the \""""Dumbo\"""" style airplanes and the \""""Merry-Go-Round\"""" style cars (located next to each other).  The other favorite of the day was the train ride.  It was a nice long ride (at least 5 minutes, maybe more) that takes you through the adjoining park.  My nephew loves trains which was part of the reason we went here, and he was not disappointed.  The Carousel also had 2 small stationary horses which the kids enjoyed (they usually choose to sit on benches instead of the up and down horses). \n\nEnchanted Island is definitely for younger kids, since there are maximum height restrictions on almost every ride.  It was reasonably priced for a day of fun for the kids.  They even have annual passes available that seemed like a good deal if you live nearby.\n\nTIP: Sign up for their email and you get a Buy 1 Get 1 Free Kids unlimited wristband coupon.",1
1292,"WOW! Where to begin... was it just me or was everyone else dazed afterwards? Lol I couldn't for the life of me figure out what the theme of this production was, other than it's a water show. There was no rhythm or reason to each of the scenes (like the scuba people), but each scene kept your eyes busy that's for sure. \n\nMy all time favorite were the 3 contortionists and that's all I'm going to say because you just have to see it to believe it! The big boat was exciting, but I don't know, I wanted more flying and swing. The music was good but the musician were in this costume above us and I think they were trying to dress like a ghost? Anyway kind of weirded me out, among other weird dead like props and costumes. If I had to pick one act to see more it would have been the clowns! They were hilarious and I loved the comic relief between all the intense acts. \n\nBy the way even if you brought tickets outside of the splash zone you could still get drizzled on, but nothing to wear a rain coat to. Also these tickets were way more than all the other Cirque du Soleil shows, but not sure if it's really worth it. It was a huge production so I understand why they had to charge as much as they did. But a lot of the acts were just extra because I only have one pair of eyes and I can only process so much at one time and it was a huge stage 8-) Not sure if I would want to see it again, but I'm glad I saw it.",1

Pizza and gelato: fantastico!!,1
1296,"I hate to be the odd man out but the previous revues must have been friends of the owner.  The Bolognese lacked flavor and the pasta was gummy and stuck together in a clump.  The Spiga salad advertised salami and pancetta\nAnd if there was one ounce of meat in it I could not find it.  My calamari was inedible and looked like it came from the frozen food case at Safeway. The dipping sauce with it was flavorless.\nOn the plus side the space is great with a good vibe.  If you go for vibe and space go, if you go for good food go somewhere else.  A generous 2 stars.\nAs usual North Scottsdale people confuse with flash with real quality cuisine.

He suggested a nice mix of charcuterie based on our adventurousness as well as provided some great tips on how to cook the steak.  With our skirt steak, he suggested that the best way to get an even temperature is to flip the steak every minute (vs flipping it once).  \n\nHe also suggested wines and cheeses that would go well with the charcuterie.  Even wrote it all down on butcher paper for us! He really knows his stuff!\n\nIs it a little on the pricey side? Sure, but not more than Whole Foods.  You are getting premium service and products so you def get what you pay for here.",1
1299,"I came back to BM for a friends B-day celebration.\n\nIt was a party of 8 or so people. My gripe is the price points for the quality.\n\nNow before you call me a \""""chincy Pittsburgher\"""", I have ate and drank in many fine establishments from NYC to Chi town to New Orleans and every where in between. \n\nBM is good per se, but its quickly becoming Ibiza-esque in that its over priced tapas that is trying to capitalize on the unique trend of small plates and \""""craft\"""" cocktails. \n\nI ordered one whiskey concoction, one glass of wine and some bacon wrapped dates. My girlfriend ordered an amaretto sour, and a gin concoction.\n\nThe Amaretto sour was about the only drink that was unique and delicious. The rest were really just so-so. Bacon wrapped dates, as always, are delcious. They had a miniscule amount of manchego cheese, however.\n\nThis brings me to my issue. Bacon wrapped dates are 10 dollars. With the sparse amount of Manchego, they are probably better suited to a price point of 6. \n\nThe cocktails for the most part were mediocre and priced at 10-12 dollars. The Ameretto Sour was the only place close to that. Try an 8 dollar price point.\n\nI can get better Tapas and Drinks for a much more reasonable price at Tamari. Better yet, try the Headkeeper in Greensburg, where I went the next day. Granted, its a suburb, but everything there is impeccable for similar prices to BM, with larger portions.\n\nI wonder how many of the customers are repeats, or simply first timers enamored with the uniqueness of the place. \n\nI wish BM all the success in the world, but I can spend 80 dollars or so elsewhere for much better food and drink.",0
1300,"I went there based on Yelp's reviews and truly wish I didn't. I believe that the person that cut my hair has absolutely no idea what cutting hair means and/or that was his first time doing it. He was done in about 7 minutes, 2 of which he had to go to the restroom wtf ?!. The next 20 minutes I spend explaining him that hair should be smooth and that I cannot have random chunks of hair all over.  It just doesn't look normal... at which point I gave up. The 5 star review are a joke and I would not recommend this place to anybody!",0
1301,"I was excited to try the food here, but it honestly was a big disappointment.  The vegetables did not taste fresh and the meal we ordered for my daughter was terrible. We had to go to get something else for her to eat - Yes, it was that bad.  My husband got lucky, his meal wasn't too bad.  I won't be going back.",0
1302,"I have been going to Last Chance since before it moved to the Colonnade in 1995.  This place is truly for the bargain shopper!  Anyone who loves to shop and is visiting from out of town MUST see it for yourself!  I highly recommend it!\n\nPrices are great - better than any Ross, Marshalls, etc.  A lot of times there are additional discounts on a category of items.  I always find something there!  Recently I got a silk chiffon formal dress for $4.75 when the dresses were 60% off.  A few months back the size 11 shoes (my size) were 60% for two weeks!  I went about 4 times and they always had new stocked shoes.  I got about 20 pairs.  Most were $8, some were $5 and the Tory Burch flats I got were $29!  The clothes are very reasonably priced.  Most tops range from $2.97 - $9.97.  Nicer brands bring the price up a bit to $19.97+.  Women's shoes mostly range from $12.97 - $29.97.  Nicer brands up to 99.97+ ( I rarely see anything higher than $29.97 in 11's:)).  Great accessories.  Lots of purses, wallets, earrings, hair clips, scarves, necklaces, watches, and random other things.  \n\nI have 3 children (gasp)!  I rarely bring them to LC.  Sometimes they do need to come so that I can try shoes on them since you cannot return them!  The kids shoes there are wonderful and such high quality.  Most are $12.97.  Most are new or like new.  You can't beat $80 shoes for 13 bucks! The kids clothing is very hit or miss.  I have found great kids belts (1.97), silk ties (.97), hats (2.97), purses (1.97), etc.  Once in awhile I find cute dresses for my six year old (5.97).  Baby girl clothes are the easiest to find.  They get a lot of diaper bags in as well.  \n\nMy husband has done well finding shoes there.  Most men's shoes are around $30.  I have found great dress shirts for him.  Most are $9.97.\n\nI don't get to go as often as I like... about 2 times a month.  I usually don't get there when they open and I still find lots of things.  Go expecting to find something and you probably will!  It can get very busy, but usually most everyone is nice and having fun searching for bargains!",1
1303,"Lot of bad reviews here.  I guess my experiences, yup that's plural, was different.  As an Asian, I always look for the hot long noodle soup.  Vegas is heaven for that reason, and this place inside the Monte Carlo has the best soup.  You get a large bowl, but the quality is what sold me.  The broth was delicious.  The noodles were chewy goodness.  Bok Choy and Won Tons perfect.  And I always add in the Crispy Duck.  Great flavor.  I always get good service, so maybe I was lucky.  But again, I've been here multiple times and will come back multiple times.",1
1304,"Definitely not one of the nicer Hiltons I've stayed at, but close to the airport...so its convenient and the inside of the place is nice enough.  Not the place you want to leave ANY valuables in your car though...the parking lot is dark in a lot of places, spaces can be finicky finding depending how busy they are and it's not in the greatest area of town.\n\nIn fact it was kind of comical...I left the hotel in the evening to grab a bite to eat...and less than a mile down the road was strip club after strip club...if that's any indication of the area.\n\nNext door is a Holiday Inn and honestly I would recommend getting the rates on both and just staying at the cheeper one.",0
1305,"Do I really have to give this one star?  Where to begin?  First tip off that our stay was going to be less than great, less than good, less than bad...the check in line.  Over an hour wait to check in to an overbooked hotel, it's like they expect for some of the guests to go to their room and imediately check out.  Reserved an upgraded non smoking room, received a standard smoking rooom.  Went to the front desk and asked to be moved to the room that was reserved, no can do, sold out.  After an aweful night sleep, uncomfortable bed, fighting in the halls and the smell of MJ all through out, we started shopping for another hotel.  Called the front desk and spoke to a manager, told the manager that we would be checking out at noon and requesting a refund if not moved to a better, quieter room.  Almost completely reserved at the Rio when the manager calls and says a new room will be available in 2 hours.  Do we risk it?  One in our party wanted to just make do and so we stayed.  \nThe lobby and casino are straight up stressful.  Packed elevators (took the stairs a lot), long waits, and inebriated 21 year olds every where.  Not enough security to handle that many people, although I did observe one security evicting a prostitute that was trying to talk her way into an elevator with an older man.  \nSpend the extra $$ and go next door to Flamingo or Harrah's, you will be thankful you did.",0
1306,"These guys perfected the modest breakfast.  It's light, well crafted, mmm good, reasonable. \n\nI can't say enough about the biscuit for my biscuits and gravy.   Wow, these guys nailed it!  The gravy was certainly good, but lacked the wow factor.  Maybe a little more sausage?\n\nMy girlfriend had the breakfast sandwich #2, which had the biscuit, havarti cheese, egg, red bell pepper, spinach.  Came with orange slices.  It was a smaller entree, but done very well.  We thought it could've used some more bell pepper, but that's being picky.",1
1307,"Just got back on this saturday afternoon and I am extremely impressed with this shop. Its clean, great floor plan, clean cases. The staff is excellent as soon as they finished with their current customers I was greeted immediately. Told them that I was looking for a Ruger SR40 which all they had was the compact version, the employee I worked with suggested a FN FNS40 and wow, it fit me perfectly. I mentioned I'm really just looking around until I have the funds and he continued to answer questions and even suggested using them as a FFL dealer if I still wanted the Ruger. We BS'd for a bit, shook hands and told me to keep researching until I found a gun that would work for me and said our good byes. I'll definitely be using this shop, and its worth the long drive to north scottsdale.",1
1308,"Blue 32 is my favorite place in town to watch a game (other than my living room). It's the best sports bar food I've had in the area, the booths are really comfortable and there are a ton of high quality HD TVs. I've been there for Oregon football games, which are always fun (except when we play an Arizona school), as well as Arizona basketball games and the NCAA tournament. I've also been there randomly when I'm craving their boneless wings...\n\nOne of the best memories I have in AZ was at Blue 32 watching the Sweet 16 game this year between Arizona and Duke. Seeing the roof blown off by all the U of A fans was pretty special...It reminded me of the fanaticism that I see in Oregon for Duck football. That's what's so great about Blue 32. It's not 100% crazy, but there's always a good energy going, with the occasional freakout moment when Derrick Williams throws down on what seems like the entire Duke starting 5...\n\nAs far as food goes, I love their boneless buffalo wings. They also have good onion rings and fries, and their burgers, sandwiches and salads are also pretty good. They have a great happy hour with cheap appetizer options (cheap boneless wings!!!) and good beer specials.\n\nThere's ample parking and outdoor seating as well. There isn't a bad seat in the house because they have so many TVs. Regardless of where you're sitting you'll be able to watch what you came to watch. If it's really busy, service gets pretty slow, so keep that in mind if you end up here during a big game. Overall, Blue 32 is a great place to come for good food and drinks while you're watching your favorite team.",1
1309,"Usually when I have gone to a Michael's Arts & Crafts store I leave screaming and running for my car. Just because of the over whelming amount of crafty people and how small and tight the aisles are.... this one, not the case. \n\nThe aisles are nice and big, the departments are all labeled with giant signs hanging from the roof, very easy to see. I was able to get in, out and on my way with no issue and in less than 20 minutes. \n\nOnly complaint I had, the maze they make you go through to check out is a little obnoxious and I inevitably ended up grabbing two impulse buys, grr!",1
1310,"Let me start off by writing why I gave this restaurant a 2 star rating. I give it  2 because the combination fried rice my fiance ordered was really good and taste authentic. \nMy visit here was horrible!! and whatever your definition of horrible is I must say I agree. We ordered our food @ exactly 11:11 my fiance's rice arrived at 11:35 not bad right?  24 minutes after ordering I'm sure the food is gonna be great. Around 11:40 umm where is my  food? (we ask athe server)  I then taste his rice and oh yes his rice is really good. 11:45 I still don't have  my food 11:48 okay? well now that he's done eating I think we should pay for what we ordered. I tell the server to please give us the check, he then tries to give us the check and the rest of our order to go! I was like really? really? I told him I don't want the food and that we will only pay for what we received. Not one person gave us an explanation on why we never received the rest of our order and or tried to appologize for what happened. I was upset and hungry, not a good combination but hey my fances combination fried rice was delicious. So unless you have time for someone else to waste your time, go right ahead and enjoy the food!",0
1311,"Just ate at Senor Tequila for the first time in a while. They have added some good specials at lunch time so the prices are very affordable. My lunch dish was under $7 and the quality of the food was good. As always, service can be hit or miss here, but I stil like the food and will definitely go back.   Also, they have taken over some space from next door, so finally the restaurant will be a little roomier.",1
1312,I gave this place a chance. Numerous times...but I now feel 100% confident in saying I will NEVER walk into this location ever again. The clothes are cheap and worth the one or two wears...but I refuse to look or speak to any of those RUDE employees. It's like you ruin their day asking for something. HR did a great job hiring the worst group of people ever. Have I mentioned that awful high pitched alarm that is constantly going off at the register?? I'll take my 20 bucks to one at Fashion Square.,0
1313,"Most horrible customer service ever. This is a location connected to a Subway, and I should have known it would be bad as the Subway people had to whistle to let the guy there know he had customers. I was looking for donuts, and the guy sighed that I was taking too long. He was texting someone in the back prior. He took my order rushing me, and then he took my money and rushed back to his phone in the back. My sister was there going to pay for her own and he left back to the back before he would take her order. Needless to say, she never got her donuts or coffee. Then, another woman came in and waited and waited and waited while he was cleaning in the back clearly in view of any customers. I was so disgusted by the donuts that I had to put them back. They tasted like they were at least a few days old and hard. Finally he came back out to help this woman, and he was on his cell phone for several minutes! She kept waiting while he talked on his phone, then another woman came in. They visibly stared at each other like WTF until he finally got off his phone and started to help them. I will never EVER order from this Winchells if I see this man there again. This happened at about 8pm Thursday night 10/04.",0
1314,"Flashback around 10 years ago. My first trip to Vegas. Imagine the amazement of this place and what was going to await me when I get to the Strip. Amazed at how the airport looked with the flashing lights and marquees and the slot machines going off. \n\nFlashforward to now after a few more trips and to this week, my latest trip there. The place needs a new overhall. They spent a shitload of money on the new City Center in Vegas on the strip but they can't seem to spend money on the airport, which looks the same and still has the same everything that this place had when I first started going to Vegas. Seriously, change things up a little. Make it more pleasing to the eyes. Hell, a new paint job would do wonders! Not really asking for an SFO type overhall. Just update the place a little. Please?",0
1315,"Korean Mexican Fusion...\n\nStarted in LA, expanding across the country. Very well done at KoMex with excellent service. great prices, and the proper divey feel. \n\nThe pork belly, bulgogi, and spicy pork are great, no matter how you have it served. Be sure to have them add kimchi to whatever you order. The meat plates are generously portioned as are the nachos and tacos.\n\nI wish there was one closer to me in San Diego...",1
1316,"Brooks is tiny, hidden and absolutely freakin' delicious.\n\nFor a mere $4.75 you too can enjoy a thick, tasty cheeseburger and a bag of substantial (both in length and girth) fries. Generally, I'm not a fry picker but by the time I got back to work I had picked away at least half my fries. Yes, they were a tad cold, but so what? The burgers were crisp on the outside and full of flavor. I love that they shred their lettuce and onions so you never end up with one little thin slice of lettuce or a bite that only tastes like onion.\n\nThe owners are super friendly, but in a way that doesn't slow the service. (You can't afford to when your waiting area is smaller than some closets.) Watch out waistline, there is a new choice on my regular lunch rotation and it's Brooks for burgers.",1
1317,"Surprisingly good. I had my doubts since it seemed overpriced from a glance at the menu, but it was quite good. I had their chicken francese, which is nothing like the typical francese sauce one might expect (creamy, with artichoke hearts and mushrooms). My boyfriend had the lasagna and enjoyed that as well. The atmosphere is very nice and the service is fairly good. They are especially attentive with the water for some reason! We could see parts of the fish tank outside from where we sat in the back...a nice view. Overall, a great experience. Expect to pay $15-$25 for your entree, however.",1
1318,"One of the few places in Vegas I can go to and enjoy Tex-Mex. Having grown up in Fort Worth, I prefer Tex-Mex to Cali-Mex, and OTB has a great menu that reminds me of home. I especially enjoy their empanadas, their salsa, and the flautas, but just about everything on the menu is great.",1
1319,"Tim was great! I can't recommend this place enough.\n\nHe gave my dress boots a great polish, gave me some pointers on caring for them a little better AND even taught be a better way to tie them.\n\nI'm 31 and this guys is teaching me to tie my shoes? Awesome.\n\nThis stand is over 25 years old and experience counts.",1
1320,"For $10 you get chicken katsu, rice, miso soup, and a cabbage salad. Everything was amazing! Who would of thought to grind up sesame seeds into the katsu sauce?!? It was delicious! I also ordered soft shell crab appetizer which was amazing! Thanks to my friend Jessica for taking me there! I am definitely going back again!",1
1321,"Read the reviews and knew it wasn't much to expect.  I only stopped by because I had a 2 for 1 coupon.  Boy, was it disappointing.  The food was very poor and nasty looking.  Looked like it has been sitting there for awhile.  I tried the mangolian bbq stuff and waited forever.  The cook was cooking it in slow motion.  Tried a little of everything and everything was just poor poor poor.  They had sushi too but I didn't dare try it.  Don't want to end up with food poisoining.  The only thing I could eat was the salad bar.  I ended up just filling myself up with salads cuz there was nothing else to eat.  The desserts was nothing to write home about except to write a poor Yelp review.  One word to sum up this buffet, disappointing!",0
1322,"Had the burger with bacon and fried egg was so tasty that I tried eating it all, I tired.\nThe wife had the turkey club and of course that was bomb with avocado.\nSo full still want more come and get yr grub on at Mimis Cafe it's a yummy time in yr tummy. Ha",1
1323,"I love this place!! If you are interested in a private room, just call ahead and let them know and they will tell you what time to come. Otherwise, walk-ins are always welcome and I have never had to wait a very long time at all. Remember to always tip well and in cash!!",1
1324,"This was our 2nd stop for Restaurant Week, this visit wasn't the greatest. I've been here before, for a birthday lunch, and was thrilled. This visit we came for brunch. We got to the hostess and asked to be seated outside. We were notified quickly that a table was open, the table right next to the entrance without a view that obviously no one wanted. I'm not sure if this was because we are locals, we were ordering from Restaurant Week menu, or that was really the last and ONLY table. This process had already taken longer than necessary so we did not fight it. Since we knew what we wanted we ordered immediately, the mixed berry smoothie, cinnamon bun hot chocolate french toast, and the hangover omelette. We waited for around 20 minutes to get our smoothies and another 45 to get our meals. The omelette was luke-warm in the middle and the french toast was good but soggy. The waitress was EXTREMELY nice and noticed we weren't pleased, she offered to take it back and was super apologetic(I wish I remembered her name). All in all this has not scared me away for life but I wish I had a better experience, especially after talking them up so much.",0
1325,"We went with a group of friends, and were very disappointed, I have been there before and I strongly recommended place, however food was terrible and overprice, I don't what had happened, service was poor, waited long for waitress to take order, or even take the drinks order, when she finally took order for food it took more than one hour wait for food to come  one at a time, 20% was added to bill, and this was not OK specially after poor service. Anyway will definitely won't EVER go back....",0
1326,"Delicious!  I had the mushroom tom yum, spring rolls, fried sweet potatoes, pineapple fried rice, and pad thai (all from the vegetarian menu).  The pad thai was my favorite.  The tofu had a nice texture; I believe it was fried.  We also ordered it with the soy chicken and that was good too.  I ordered the soup WAAAAY too spicy, but it was good.  BTW, their cup of soup is HUGE.  I was expecting the size to be similar to miso soup (like how it's served at sushi places) but it was much bigger.\n\nI would definitely return to Komol when in Vegas.  If you are a vegetarian, it is worth checking out.",1
1327,"I stayed here for a few days for a conference. I'm not the sort of person who says, \""""Yippee, I get to go to Vegas.\"""" Vegas, in fact, gets on my nerves. I don't gamble, and I hate it that the entire city seems to be conspiring to get me lost in a casino. This hotel is one of the few in Vegas without a casino, so for me, it was perfect: Nice and calm. Plus, the people who work there are just about as sweet as they come, particularly the staff at the bar, where I had a number of pleasant, satisfying meals that were reasonably priced, given the context of Vegas. I'm thinking never will be too soon for me to return to this city, but if I ever do, I will return to this hotel, which made the whole business a lot more tolerable than it could have been. (I'm giving it only four stars, because I save five stars for truly extraordinary experiences, and, at the end of the day, it's an ordinary hotel that happens to be located in a really disturbingly weird place.)",1
1328,"I frequent Nordstrom cafe for lunch almost once a week.  Although the food is outstanding, the service is what keeps me loyal.  Each time I go, an employee named Rick recognizes me and immediately takes care of me and my guests like a 5 star dining establishment.  He is attentive and always remembers what we drink etc.  I have never seen such a dedicated employee who clealry cares about his customers and takes the upmost pride in his job,  He always makes our dining experience remarkable.  I highly recomend visiting this wonderful cafe and if you are lucky, Rick will be your server.  He really is a gem!!!!",1
1329,"Ate there for Valentine's dinner.  Too expensive.  Portions very tiny.  No bread.  Salad was tasty enough but consisted of about two tablespoons of mixed Greek salad.---I'm not kidding.\n\n  My dish was salmon.  The fish was cold and the sauce was congealing.  Had to send it back for reheat.  My Valentine's was sword fish, which consisted of about 3 one inch square pieces. Also cold. \nNo bread, no Pita bread.  The sword fish was about $24, and the salmon, about that much, too.  The wine list was all Greek wine, and the glasses the wine was served in were like little toy glasses, not real wine glasses.  Our waiter was kind of lackadaisical.  \nThere were food splatters on the white wall next to the table.\n\nWhen a short woman made rounds about the tables to ask how we liked our food, we didn't  trust ourselves to even get started, and mumbled, \""""thank you.\""""  All the \""""Best of Phoenix\"""" favorable reviews were at least 10- 20 years old.\nThe bathroom had toilet paper stuck to the wet floor of one stall, and the toilet installed inches from the side wall in the other stall.  Weird.  There was a table with chairs outside the bathroom, like they seated overflow guests there.  Weird.\nWe vowed never to go back, and remembered maybe that's why we hadn't been there for years.  Better to eat at Crazy Jim's or Greek Town. \nSave your money.",0

1331,"Worst buffet ever made in vegas. Basically a rip off ($35 each), with just a straight line of selection.

1333,"I called on Monday on the first of my 3 days off to see if I can get my oil pan gasket repaired like I'd been meaning to.  They said it would be about $250 and Wednesday morning would work if I'd drop it off in the morning when they open.  So I dropped it off at 715am and called around 2pm after I hadn't heard from them expecting my car to be done or close to done.  Turns out they hadn't even looked at my car yet.  Then they told me they had to fix the oil (?) sensor and wanted to do a blue dye diagnostic test.  I paid about 150 for that.\n\nAfter about 3k miles I went back and they told me what I had told them in the first place.  Its probably the oil pan gasket and its 250.  They also said it could be something else that cost 850.  I'd invested so much I decided to go for it.  Maybe they're just thorough right?\n\nSo a week later I went out of town for a few days and came back and sure enough, oil is still leaking out of my car.  So it must be an $850 repair thing.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit annoyed that they try to make you schedule an appointment every time, but they don't have the same respect for your time.  After that first time, the next one I asked them how long it would take (a couple hours) so I scheduled to come in first thing (7am).  When I asked them if it would be done by noon they wouldn't even promise me that at first!  That's 5 hrs for something that takes 2hrs according to them.  So for that I don't think they're the auto repair shop for me.",0
1334,"Have not been to a Sizzler in decades, but the quality of food and service at this location was pretty spot on. The salad and soup bar and ice cream was only $6.49 at lunch (2 bucks more if you want taco/hot bar which looked very average). They had four soups and the best of the two I tried was the Chicken rice gone wild, which was loaded with stuff. French onion was decent too (add croutons) and two other creamier soups were untried. The salad bar was well stocked and had every veggie you possible could have needed, plus endless slices (still in the shell) of avocado which is a great addition. Plus, there is a waitress who refills drinks and brings you your choice of famous cheese toast or rolls or in my case both and you can get more of either. The cheese toast is pretty addicting. Most customers speak spanish, but that is just the area and the food is well worth the price if you are around this neck of the woods.",1
1335,"I am writing this as there have not been any reviews of this restaurant in over a year, and I feel that Kanda is better than what comes across from the reviews to date. We went today because the reviews of the food itself seem ok.\n\nSo how was it? The food was absolutely great, and the service was efficient. I won't say the waiters were falling over themselves to be friendly and attentive. But they were courteous enough, and got the business done swiftly. Best of all, they were in no hurry to get rid of us.\n\nThe cost is ~$23 per person, and that includes sushi, sashimi, and lots of other assorted stuff. They give you pieces of paper to fill out what you want, with everything fairly well described in English and French. Once you've finished eating, they bring the sheets of paper back so you can ask for more.\n\nThe quality of the sushi and sashimi  was very high, and the temperature was good.\n\nI would certainly go back.",1
1336,"A roach crawled across our table right after we received our bill. How convenient! Was this part of the authentic ambience? UGH. I finished that last roach..err, I mean roasted duck with glee. And those MSG pan-fried veggies? Oh honey, I requested a second serving.  Then that fucking cucaracha caught my eye in the very end.  In hindsight, I should've told them and cursed them out, but I just wanted to get the fuck out of there. Unfortunately, paranoia and thoughts of roaches crawling everywhere in the kitchen invaded my psyche afterwards. My insides felt like shit. \n\nWhen we arrived at Ichiza for dessert, I threw up in the bathroom. Glamorous, I know. But I wanted that shit out of my system. I downed a bottle of beer and water hoping it would make me feel better. It did. My brilliant rationale is the alcohol would help vanquish those germs. Thus, dodging food poisoining. I woke up today feeling fine. Yesterday was my first and last visit.",0

She is from hell, he's angrier than she is.  They close at 8pm so it isn't the hours.  But I'll tell you this: the pizza is fine, another $20 large pizza served by ANGRY, ANGRY transplants.\n\nI'm never going back so that now leaves me at least 3412 OTHER pizza joints I can go to that aren't angry with the world.",0
1339,Thin Man Sandwich Shop is not your typical deli. I've had the Il Bastardo and The Thin Man - both signature sandwiches but the latter being the most popular in the joint. The sandwiches are pricey but large (sandwiches are about $10). I found myself ordering a side but the sandwiches alone fill me up way past dinner. The ingredients are fresh with the sandwiches made in front of you and the unique combinations tantalize the taste buds. Something unfamiliar and pushes my boundaries but is delicious. Worth giving a shot if you have an open mind!,1
1340,"I didn't have any if the - experiences as other yelpers. It's 1am and my very nice waitress Elizabeth just cleared my plate. Got the steak and eggs for $6.99. My boyfriend, also. He ordered rare and myself medium rare. (Elizabeth did ask both steak and eggs preference for preparation) they were as ordered. Hot and delicious. I added some salt because I like kidney failure. The usual standard toast and hash-browns, as expected. I don't know how anyone could complain with what we experienced. My water cup was refilled before it was empty, we didn't wait more than 2 minutes... Two! And our check was dropped as we ate. Loved it. Very satisfying after walking allllll day and having pizza for lunch! Thanks Flamingo:D",1
1341,"I'd give this place Zero Stars if I could. Where to begin?..\n\nThe entire place is dirty. Seriously, noone is even cleaning up the hair off the floor or bothering to wipe off counters. The bathrooms are even gross.\n\nThe staff is lazy and more importatnly, the students have NO clue what they're doing.  Most of them have no business being out on the floor yet.\n\nExamples - I went here for a simple mani/pedi. 3 HOURS into my appointment, I finally gave up and told a manager I was leaving. There were too many disgusting reasons to list them all, but a few that stand out - The student doing my nails had never done a gel mani before and had no idea what she was doing. She literally spilled polish remover down my ENTIRE leg and then proceeded to soak my feet - which you CANNOT do if you're using gel polish. I had asked her several times if she was sure she knew what she doing, and she told me she'd gone in the back and asked the senior techs.\nShe had dandruff and was missing front teeth - no, it's not a beauty contest. But when the person giving you a manicure is literally shaking dandruff onto your hands, it's repulsive. Like it or not, if you're going to work in the beauty industry, you do have to take care of how you present yourself.\n\nI could go on and on...but I think you get the point.",0
1342,"I really enjoyed Crema Caf\u00e9 before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast. Unfortunately after expanding, the food and customer service has gone downhill. While dining there this morning I tasted my side salad and it was SALTY. I don't understand why they started adding salt and pepper to their delightfully simple side salad, it's BAD. When I asked a staff member if the added salt to the salad she said no, but we heard the cook in the background correct her. The breakfast sandwich was ok but definitely not worth $9 with the salty side salad that is inedible. The last time we visited, the food was really bad too. I LOVE the killer scramble (scrambled eggs, goat cheese, and smoked salmon). The salmon must have been expired because it smelled and tasted awful. With some quality control and improved service this restraint could be great again.",0
1343,"In the past five years, the Las Vegas Nordstrom has declined tremendously!   The quality of merchandise is shoddy and the customer service leaves a lot to be desired.

Since the opening of the Las Vegas store, it has never been \""""as good\"""" as those in California, but I still enjoyed shopping there.

NOPE the pizza tasted kinda rubbery and the chicken parm wasnt even chicken parm, it was some chicken thigh pieces that were coated w a grip of cheese and sauce-no breading...and the bread was sogggggyyyyy...worst ever! im not a big review person but i gotta warn people. only went here bc someone wrote a good review- they were sooo lying...dont waste your time or money!!!",0

1353,"Was excited to try this place out with the wife for a friends birthday dinner. Atmosphere was great even for June on the patio. They had black bean tortillas and whipped butter on the tables that was delicious. Margaritas were good and that would probably wrap up all the good. \n\nNow the ugly, we were with a large party that showed up in groups. Which most service people would assume separate checks or at least ask. This wasn't a concern until the end of the evening, when our server presented 1 check and expressed dismay along with words of discouragement that it would take a while to split, very unprofessional for an upscale Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. I believe that the management at this establishment is non existent. Servers seem to do as they please, reach over guests, place plates in front of incorrect guests. Many of the simple things that management would typically ensure that there staff is engaged in doing correctly. \n\nNow the food. Carne y Camerones (steak and shrimp) great ingredients but poor execution. The steak was overcooked as well as the shrimp and served cold. The mashed potatoes were tasty but dry and cold as well. I feel that the cooks had their timing off, maybe because of the large party or just the fact that they didn't care. The technique and the ingredients were there for a great meal but it felt thrown together and was served cold. \n\nThis restaurant could be great, they have a good menu, good drinks, great atmosphere, but the service, execution, professionalism, and passion is not there. I blame the management.",0
1354,Today I only tried the Thai iced tea and fried ice cream I had to cure my sweet tooth. \n\nThe Thai iced tea was good and Im still sipping on it now BUT the fried ice cream was a disaster! It was a thick ball of fried crust I opened it up an out poured nothing but melted ice cream WHAT A BUMMER yuck I will never ever order that again.,0
1355,"This was truly one of the most interesting, trippiest things I've ever experienced. \n\nWhen the beau and I decided on a one-night stay in Pittsburgh, we knew right away that the Warhol Museum was on our must-do list. We saved it for the last activity of the day and strolled around eyes-wide-open, speechless and entranced the entire time. I think the only thing that made us giggle a little was whole oral sex with a nanner flick--but hey, we never claimed to be mature. \n\nAs you already know, this building is packed floor after floor with mesmerizing works of art, photos, videos and information about the interesting life of Andy Warhol himself. In fact, I would have loved even more nitty-gritty info about his short time on this earth. I'm not sure I've ever taken so much time in a museum to make sure I read every minuet detail. \n\nI know it's probably clich\u00e9, but The Silver Cloud Room blew my friggin' mind. I must have stood in there for like 10 minutes just staring at these floating pillows of silver crash into one another and well--me. What a simple, yet deep and interesting concept. \n\nI loved the rooms painted all white with just a few of his paintings hung. You just sit on the bench in the middle and soak in your own interpretation. I sat in the Skull room and just looked up in awe. \n\nI really think everyone should experience this museum at least once in their lifetime. The work of this fascinating man truly spoke of the art and times of our generation. it was new, different and left so much room for individual interpretation. I think that's what I love the most. Warhol's work doesn't tell you what to think, it let's you figure it out yourself. \n\nOne thing I could do without would be the pretentious preteens running the admissions desk. Yes, I realize I'm not wearing skinny jeans, glasses and a hipster outfit, but I still appreciate art. Get over yourself.",1

How can a restaurant mess up Irish pub food? Answer: Tilted Kilt found a way. OFTEN.  It's bad enough this place is filled with servers who look like cheap Arizona hookers walking the Van Buren stroll (nice and respectful of women, I might add). But even worse - SOME GIRLS DON'T BELONG IN SKIMPY OUTFITS LIKE THAT! Management needs to get some glasses and a new menu.  Disgusting on every level.",0
1357,"This was the second time I have visited Road Runner, the first was about 5 years ago.  My husband and I decided to give it another chance, as it was very late and we were hungry.  The menu was pretty small and there was only one bartender late night to serve us...And I still looked past it all in order to give them a second chance.  I usually don't take too much of an acount into small menus or slow service when it's late night.  My eggs and bacon were decent, my husband's sandwich was ok, and then....later that night....kaboom food poisoning.  Can't usually blame one place, but it was the only place we had eaten together in days, and the last meal I had was a frozen meal from the microwave, I'd say there's a pretty good chance the culprit was right there at road runner.

So, I was excited to give this one a shot, as I have totally given up on their other locations for anything other than drinks, and light snacks.\n\nThe outside eating area and bar are just perfect for the fall weather. The design is simple, cohesive, friendly & warm. The praise stops there.\n\nWe ordered chips & guac. The chips tasted like they were fried in old oil, and the guac had a flavor that certainly wasn't guac-licious... more on the verge of going bad. \n\nOne person joining us had the deconstructed tacos, which she barely touched, as the fish was more like fish jerky, and the side of beans totally tasteless. I shared the \""""best turkey sandwich\"""" with someone, and had high expectations with a name like that. It was a soggy mess of flavors. None of the ingredients stuck out, and it quickly fell apart after the first bite. \n\nNothing was exceptional.

I again pulled around to look for a corporate telephone number to which I was unsuccessful.\n\nBottom line, don't waste your time if you are trying to get some food in the later part of the evening at this location.

At the counter, I saw a lady on the phone so I didn't think much of it.  After 10 minutes of being on the phone she didn't even look up to help me or ask me what I needed.

1366,"What a pleasant surprise!!!  Great little Sushi-Tapas bar in the Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh.  Peking duck quesadilla was a great spicy starter; followed by the bacon wrapped quail egg skewer...excellent!  The Tamari roll was wonderful, with incredibly fresh fish, topped with fresh scallops.  The chicken lemongrass empanadas were really unique, and tasted great.  I also ordered the TNT roll which was everything but the kitchen sink and very, very good!  Stu and Matt, our own personal sushi chefs were fantastic and clearly talented in their skills.  Lastly, the tuna nigiri was unbelievable, sweet and buttery.  The fish here is as fresh as you'll find anywhere.  \n\nI will definitely come back the next time I visit Pittsburgh!  Oh, p.s. the variety of food on the menu was really extensive.

The place is always empty-ish, always reeking of desperation, always cluttered with a slow-moving line (even if you're the only customer, there will somehow be a slow-moving line), and always fundamentally bland and mediocre, with small portions, too.\n\nIt's not even really cheap, other than by comparison to the Scottsdale prices surrounding it.

1368,"Ok, I was back in Vegas again last week for business.  Samba is always the first place I start craving to eat at whenever I'm in Vegas, so as usual, went there again on my first night in town.  Although the Rodizio (meat served continuously from servers carrying skewers of it around) is the most popular thing to order (and really very good in terms of variety, taste and portion)...but I always eat too much when I do the all-u-can eat thing.  \n\nSo, I did my \""""plan b\"""" for when I'm not totally ravenous...I ordered the Mahogany Glazed Salmon.  Their salmon is AWESOME, prepared in a different way than I've ever had Salmon anywhere else.  Not exactly sure what's in the Mahogany glaze, but it sure makes Salmon dee-licious!  It still comes with their amazing bread (I love the little cheese rolls with the dipping sauces they bring), their fresh-tossed salad which is great, and their rice/beans, creamed spinach, candied carrots & plantains.  I can't decide if I like their side dishes or their entrees better, I literally eat everything on my plate there.  \n\nOh, and this last time, I bumped it up a notch and tried their key lime pie for dessert.  I grew up eating the key lime pie at Joe's Stonecrabs (in Miami Beach, and more recently Chicago and Vegas).  Joe's key lime pie is the \""""benchmark standard\"""" of key lime pie.  However, I have to say, I think Samba's gives Joe's a run for their money, it was about the best pie I've ever tasted...definately will be having it again next time I'm in Vegas!  \n\nI'm almost afraid to post this review, and I hope all of y'all don't decide to go to Samba's and make it impossible for me to get a table!  And no, I'm not a shareholder in this restaurant, or in the Mirage, though I sure wish I was!

1370,"My Dog had been boarded here before several times over the last 12 months with no problems. I even recommended them to others and brought them business. We bought a package of 10 nights of boarding as it saved us money to buy them in advance.This December 2012 we dropped our cavalier off on the way to the hospital to have our first baby. We then received a call a few days later from the manager saying our dog caught KENNEL COUGH from another dog and was transported to a Veterinarian's office where we would need to pick him up from. The manager also said we needed to pay her back for what she had to pay the vet and that we also owed  them $70 for boarding. This place is not very organized and they don't ever have you sign papers or even check you in on the computer. I am not sure how they are able to keep track of things. When we picked our dog up from the vet's office that they had taken him to he was covered in dried up dog poop, his butt was bleeding, and he was coughing with a runny nose. It made me feel horrible to see my dog like this-he was miserable. I trusted these people with my dog and was very disappointed and angry when I picked him up and he was sick and covered in feces. I had just had a baby and did not need this added stress and neither did my dog! To make it worse when we went to pay Gilbert dogs the $70 that the manager had told us we owed was now $100.

Even for a AAA Five-Diamond award winner, Mobil Five-Star and Michelin Five-Star hotel, I don't think their \""""basic\"""" rooms are worth the average $250/night.  Why break the bank for a room that you barely spend time in and then have nothing to spend the rest of the weekend?  \n\nThe \""""basic\"""" room at the Wynn is pretty nice, (but not worth $250/night).  There are coral colored walls with huge flower prints framed in the rooms.  They provide little slippers to wear and lush, Egyptian cotton robes for you in the closet.  The bathroom has a spa/tub, shower with sitting area, vanity table and chair and a heated lighted makeup mirror.  There's a hair dryer provided, Q-tips, makeup cotton pads, lotion and shampoo/conditioner.  The soaps are pretty nice, as they're lemongrass scented.  Heyyyy...I think the bath water is chlorinated because no water turns that pretty shade of light blue in the tub.  And you smell kind of chlorine-like and dry when you emerge from the tub.  Hmm.\n\nThe bed is not too soft but not too firm.  All of the pillows are down/or down-like.  The 40-45 inch flat screen TV is mounted on the wall, but can rotate a full 90 degrees so you can watch TV in bed.  There's a small seating area with a velour yellow love seat in the room, and another desk with a fax, phone and ?wi-fi set up.  It's definitely a spacious room.  All the rooms at Wynn have floor to ceiling windows and this is a definite plus!  Make sure to ask for a non-smoking room, and a room higher than Floor 20 for a good view.  I would ask for a golf-course view, since the views facing the Strip/Fashion Show mall seem more noisy with the huge Ipod commercials blaring through your windows.  \n\nAnd the rest of the hotel............it's such a beautiful place.  Lots of bright red carpets with butterflies on the ground.  Tons of mosaics on the walls and all the restaurants have thick, textured drapery.  You can tell Wynn has gone one step beyond his Bellagio creation to create a classy establishment.  The shopping area is of course, high end, but the sales associates don't give you any attitude even if you're just in there browsing.  Overall, 4 stars for the Wynn!",1
1383,"The place was ok but the guy working there was awful.\n\nI went climbing with a group of four people. It had been awhile since I had climbed and I couldn't quite remember how to tie the figure 8 knot so I went to the counter to ask the guy working. He was sitting in the little office near the entrance talking on the phone but I managed to get his attention and he said he'd be right out. \n\nHe finally left the office, phone still attached to his ear which he handed off to his friend who was there visiting. I know, popular guy. My friend then went up to the counter and told him we needed some instruction on knot tying. He scoffed at the fact that we couldn't remember how to start the knot required to use the equipment that we had just paid for but said he would be over in a minute.\n\nWe stood there waiting for a good 15 minutes for this jackhole and finally gave up and asked one of the more experienced climbers how to tie the knot. As soon as she started to give us a little lesson, the clown who works there walks over saying something about how non employees aren't allowed to give lessons but he was gonna be nice and turn his back while she did. Really?\n\nFor my money, Nevada Climbing Center is way better and the people are much nicer.",0
1384,"Tried this place out since high ratings on Yelp and it was on Food Network as one of the top places for great food at great prices.  \n\nAs most have mentioned the stuffed Dates were amazing (I was a little hesitant to try - but certainly was worth it).  We also had the Artichoke Toast, Ham & Cheese Croquetas, Camarones Ajillo & Terra y Mare Skewers.  Our favorite was the Terra y Mare Skewers.  I am not a shrimp fan but the Camarones Ajillo was our 2nd favorite with a great sauce.\n\nService was great and very helpful to assist us on first time visiting.  We did make reservation ahead of time just in case and it was a great experience overall to dine at this place.\n\nIf you are in the area this is a great place to eat and you have to try a little bit of everything.  Overal for the 5 plates, 2 drinks & 2 desserts our meal was $50.  I believe this is a great price for the quality of the food with the great service.",1
1385,"Was just down here on vacation, and I will be going back next time I am in Charlotte. This place is just simply amazing for food. I had some shrimp tacos that I loved. The app I had was average, and the beer selection was average as well. The waitress was just above average. If they just improve a few things, this is a 5 star place, but the food enough is reason to come back!",1
1386,"Overall, I have had an extremely negative experience with the people running this rescue. My adopted puppy is wonderful, thankfully healthy, and the process of adopting was easy and straightforward, however Moondoggies absolutely disappeared after I paid my adoption fee and spay deposit and failed to follow through on any of their commitments. At the adoption meeting, I was told that she was microchipped already, and as soon as she was old enough to spay the rescue would arrange a spay appointment for me with one of their vets (I was told I was welcome to use a vet of my choice, but in that case I would be responsible for covering the bill).  The foster mom also said that she would follow up in a week to make sure that the adoption was going smoothly. I never heard from them. I sent many e-mails (about 5 or 6 over the course of four months) and left several phone messages asking for her microchip information and for details on how the spay would be scheduled. They also never responded when I was having difficulty activating my free ShelterCare pet insurance. Despite their lack of communication, I was still giving them the benefit of the doubt thinking that they were extremely busy, disorganized, or something of that sort. Once the month of her spay approached, I started to become much more suspicious of their behavior and decided to investigate. That is when I found these yelp reviews, and I couldn't believe that so many other adopters had the exact same experience! \n\nI talked to my friend who is an attorney, and he suggested that I notify Moondiggies that I will take them to small claims court if they do not follow through on their promises designated in the contract, our e-mails, and in our conversations with the foster mom. Low and behold, I get a response within one hour of sending that e-mail! I was very frustrated that they had been ignoring all of my previous communications efforts, but I was happy that they were offering to follow through with the spay and microchipping. Unfortunately, after one or two e-mails promising to schedule these appointments, they again dropped all communication.  I still intend to follow up with our attorney.\n\nI have wanted to give this rescue the benefit of the doubt because it is run by volunteers, but after these experiences I am very doubtful of their legitimacy. If they are in fact a rescue, they are very poorly run and are, even if unintentionally, still cheating people out of their money and not following through on their commitments. What concerns me most is that due to their shady behavior with me and so many others who have posted reviews, I am doubtful that they are a legitimate rescue. I contacted petfinder.com to see if they had any more information on this rescue, and they informed me that due to many complaints Moondoggies has been removed from their site (I definitely commend petfinder on their great mission and the responsibility they showed in investigating questionable rescues). I truly hope that this is an organization that is really trying to help homeless pets, and that these reviews will help convince them that they need to change the way that they are running their business.",0
1387,"tiny little place, delicious shawarmas. I've lived in the middle east and grown up eating them. I always felt that most shawarma places have north-americanized the shawarma recipie. These guys kept it real. The meat in both the beef and chicken shawarmas were perfectly seasoned, very juicy and the meat to salad ratio in the wrap was perfect. Ive had shawarmas in the past where the meat is very fatty. Not at all at this place.  Also, I could not believe the price! 4.50 for a decently sized wrap. it's also open late so after a night out, definitely a place to stop and refuel.",1
1388,"Was so cute! A hidden gem:) In an old house lies this restaurant covered by a huge beautiful pine tree. We had the house brisket and biscuit on a food tour last night. Sat outside under the tree. Started with a glass of prosecco. Kind of reminded me of restaurants in Napa, local fresh food. Laid back atmosphere like a summer day on the back porch. 4 stars because we didn't try everything and well...After looking at the menu it is a bit expensive. Definitely will be back for a romantic date night though!! They need a happy hour to be a bit more affordable.",1
1389,"We had the Queso Fundido with Taquitos for an appetizer. The dip was great and the chips were great, but the taquitos were dry and boring. For entrees, we had the mole, which was good, but not great. We also had the mango, chipotle chicken and the sauce was great, but the chicken was dry and overcooked. None of the flavor was soaked into the chicken, so it tasted bland.\n\nAs others have said, the entrees are very large, so that is a plus.\n\nWe would like to come back and try happy hour and some \""""safer\"""" entrees such as the chimichanga and hopefully they will be better executed.",0
1390,"This was yet another stop on what turned into our Fall Break Tour of Phoenix Magazine's Best New Restaurants of 2009.  Unfortunately, I disagreed with Phoenix Magazine again.  It was lunchtime and we had been doing a lot of shopping, so the husband and I had worked up quite the appetite.  We didn't realize that America's was going to be more like appetizer sized food that comes out in entree time.  We waited in line for about 5 minutes or so, I looked at the menu and decided to go basic with a bean and cheese burrito.  It sounded really good at the time.  We ordered and then sat down and waited.  \n\nAnd waited, and waited, and waited.  Ugh!  But wait, the husband's food came out first.  Almost an entire five minute before mine.  His meal was so small he was pretty much finished by the time I got my burrito.  My burrito was really blah.  I think it's cool that they don't cook the beans with lard, but apparently that translates into a complete and utter lack of flavor.  Same goes for the cheese.  I had no idea any was even in there.  So, I left hungry and unhappy with a nasty bean film in my mouth.  I won't be back.",0
1391,"Stopped by after reading Darren's review.   Unfortunately, that bbq has close, but...a new place has already opened in its place.  Was talking with our server and he said they opened on April 4.  The previous bbq that was in this location was only open about one to two months and closed.  The building owner worked with Swhinery to open up. \n\nwww.facebook.com/theswhinery\n\nThe bar area does allow smoking not including the smoke from the smoked meat.  The restaurant in the back room is non-smoking. \n\nSwhinery bbq has won awards at many bbq cook offs up and down the east coast.  Check out their facebook page and look at the banners on the side of the building.\n\nThe food is good.  The Blackened tuna with sesame had some nice flavors and definitely had sesame favor, was cooked perfectly and was a great meal.  The ribs are good.  The ribs come with the Swhinery bbq sauce that is a little sweet but has some sharpness.  There is a Hot Swhinery bbq sauce that I preferred.  Also, a mustardy Carolina sauce is available.  Was surprised at the variety on the menu.",1
1392,"They say that first impression will determine how likely you are to re visit a location again, unless you are one of those people that are determined to give everything and everyone a second chance, which I am not. But let me just say that I will be more than likely to visit the Mesa Arts Center again and possibly again, depending on my second impression of course. \n\nFirst of all the building itself is a feast for the eyes, an inverted eyesore if I may. A huge, modern, contemporary building, sandwiched in between mostly sub-par fast food joints and cash your check now locations. And since I am still fairly new and unfamiliar to this area and the fact that I have never been to down town Mesa, my expectations were, let's just say that I went in to this without really knowing what to expect. \n\nNever the less, once I entered the doors I was immediately greeted by a sweet old lady that might have noticed the confusion on my face. Since the only clue my ticket gave me of where I was going was a big green arrow that said enter here and the slightly cryptic seating and tier coding left me confused of where I was going, but luckily this lady came to my rescue and made sure I ended up where I needed to be.\n\nI went to see Video Games Live at the Ikeda theatre, a combination of my two biggest interests in life, music and video gaming. When attending a show of this style with the properness of classical music and the youthfulness of video games you can expect a clash of social norms. You see people wearing formal attire and younger teenagers decked out in this season's latest Hot Topic fashion.\n\nThey played song like Pac Man, Super Mario, Zelda and one of my personal favorites when it comes to newer games being Assassins Creed. The first three mentioned are theme songs that anyone would be able to recognize and Assassins Creed is designed from the get go with classical music so the experience is only enhanced by hearing it live combined with the visual elements and clips from the game.\n\nAll in all, having a great view of the orchestra, unobstructed sound, a beautiful venue and last but not least, the importance of art in our society made my fist but not last experience with the Mesa Arts Center something I would recommend to anyone.",1
1393,"As you will see from my reviews I have eaten at high end steak places in NY, Philadelphia and DC.....this is definitely in the top 5 of all of them.   \n\nWe went here with a group and ate on a thursday night, we had no problem getting a table for 4 at 8pm with reservations.   \n\nI had the lobster with bacon appetizer which was honestly the lowlight of my meal but still very good.   My wife had a beet salad which looked nice and a friend of mine split onion rings with the table.   The free fries were also amazing and we loved the different sauces.\n\nNext came the main courses.   My wife ordered a filet done perfectly.   My friends GF had the halibut which was also excellent.   I had the regular rib eye and the king crap options as did my friend.   Let me just say this steak was seasoned and cooked PERFECTLY.   The king crap legs that were the side were amazing.   They were split and all of the good parts were left.   A great addition! \n\nWe got the mashed potato sides  as well as a mushroom that was part of a forrest fire.   \n\nI think that this is a great steakhouse and a great place to eat.   I would highly recommend this place in LV.",1
1394,"WOW! \n\nthe bf and i had made reservations here before we were off to watch jersey boys, and everything from start to finish was fabulous. We were seated right away with delicious, fresh, warm, bread to snack on before our meal. coming in I knew i wanted steak, so i ordered the \""""classique\"""" since it's always better to be safe the first time, right? the steak is large but thin at the same time. the BUTTER on top omg, i don't think i've ever had steak like that before. it was goddamn mouthwatering. hats off to the chef for cooking it a perfect medium rare too. and the fries, wow. I am NOT a french fries person, but i ended up inhaling these thin, oddly cut fries. \n\nthe restaurant is gorgeous on top of the great service. I had requested to be seated on the patio, but because it's so cold these days it was covered up. No worries, the view of the bellagio foundation always looks good. \n\ni will DEFINITELY be back next time i'm in town.",1
1395,"I am forced to give this dining experience one star since no stars or negative rating is not an option. Besides the poorly attentive, or lack there of, wait staff, the food was deplorable from cold potato skins to horrible & incorrect sandwiches. It took forever to even get the bill or table cleared. This restaurant would be better served as a parking lot for the better surrounding establishments",0
1396,"Don't know what to say. I was a server at one time and I know damn well this is not the way to give good service. Waited like 15 mins before the server even noticed us. Apologizes for being the only person on the floor, takes a while for our drinks to come, and when we have had enough of their service and decide to pay the tab it takes 15-20 mins to get the tab and another 15 mins to get my card back. All in all this place is not a good spot to expect good/speedy service. \n        Now for the drinks. The drink are expensive unless you go during happy hour. Which I did so I have no complaints about that. Drinks were good. The food was good too. That's the only reason why I am even giving this place a 1 star. No bueno!!!",0
1397,"My husband and I have recently moved to San Tan Valley and, as is known, we are food enthusiasts that rarely agree with the reviews here.  We were looking for burgers and decided to go for Dave's, which is less than 10 minutes from our new home. And yes, it is in a Chevron gas station!    Wow.  I really don't understand most of the reviews here.  When we arrived (our second trip since they are not open on Sunday) it is true that there was no one at the counter, but it took about 3 minutes for one of the employees to ask us if we were needing to place an order.  We asked for a minute to look at the menu board.  She gave us a very friendly smile and let us look. (it was very clear they had been on their break, this is a small operation)  Just a minute or two later the other employee and cook, Michael, came to the counter.  His smile and bright eyes literally lit up the place.  \n\nWe ordered two #2 burgers with everything (that includes a double decker burger with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle and, special sauce for $6.95), plus bacon and onion rings ($1.00 each, if you want).  He asked if we had our coupon.  We said it was our first time here (we gathered what to order from previous posts) and he declared that we MUST have a coupon, and then proceeded to comp us all our upgrades (bacon, jalepenos, and onion rings) in addition to then handing us a coupon for 25% off any orders over $10.00 on further meals.  Michael was very jovial and pleasant, and made us feel like we were old, treasured customers.\n\nThe burgers arrived after about 10-15 minutes.  You could tell everything is cooked to order, including the fries and onion rings.  The burgers were double decker, lightly seasoned and very fresh meat, with the cheese melted and the bacon applied to both layers of the burger.  All the ingredients were fresh...crisp tomato and lettuce, dill pickles that were crisp and tart, not the sad, limp sweet pickles most places put on their burgers.  They were truly flavorful and delicious.  \n\nNormally we would take pictures first, but these burgers looked and tasted so good, that upon the first bite, both my husband and I macked them down within about 5 minutes.  That is how good they were!  And this is from someone that usually cannot even finish half of a single burger without saving it for later!  And the onion rings were superb!  Beer battered, golden brown, crisp deliciousness!  When you take a bite, the onion does NOT slide out of the ring, as most do.  They are tender, but crisp and very flavorful.  \n\nWe were happy enough with the experience to talk about going back for dinner that night and breakfast the next day to try the breakfast burritos that they have all day!  We did go back 2 days later to try some of their sandwiches, that I will post about soon, but needless to say, we have NOT had a bad experience here at all and recommend the food (at a gas station, no less!)  for it's freshness, quality, price and staff.",1
1398,"ACCOMMODATIONS\n5 stars, as always - isn't that a given at any Mandarin Oriental? Love the new control panels, which literally run everything from the curtains to the lights to the entertainment system from right next to the bed. Piggy particularly likes the \""""wake up\"""" settings, which you can program to turn on the lights and/or open the blackout curtains at a certain time (or even gradually turn on the lights over an extended period), which makes for a remarkably calm morning, with far fewer incidents of startled-tumbling-out-of-the-bed than a regular wakeup call or alarm clock - now, how do I wire up the pigpen with one of these systems? (^(oo)^)\n\nROOM SERVICE\ntypically tasty Mandarin Oriental fare available 24 hours a day, although this little piggy was a bit saddened that there is no spaghetti bolognese (one of my great favourites from the MONYC's room service menu). The breakfast selection is especially creative, IPHO; piggy highly recommends the excellent banana walnut french toast! (^(oo)^)v\n\nservice is *very* prompt; I like that they give a specific time (e.g. \""""we'll be delivering your order no later than 2:36pm\"""") which gives hungry little piggies a nice, definitive number of minutes for counting down (^(oo)^)v\n\nDOORMEN\nI really think the doormen & bellhops are one of the Mandarin Oriental's great secrets.

Very comfy lounge chairs with extra cushy padding, and fantastic cabanas with actual sofas on which little piggies can lounge about in a leisurely fashion while conveniently avoiding the sun. Each cabana even has its own TV inside, which also serves as a handy partition, so you don't have to awkwardly pretend you don't see/hear the occupants of the next cabana sitting 2 feet away (^(oo)^)",1
1399,"While on the strip looking for a place to drink we were approached and said there is a cover ($20), but drinks are free.  We thought, why not?  \n\nWe were there pretty early, so it wasn't that packed until later in the night.  This place is relatively small (even when it isn't busy) and the free drinks didn't have much alcohol in them.  That was disappointing. \n\nAlthough since we were pretty sloshed anyway, we considered getting a tattoo here.  Luckily one of us had some rational sense and left before getting inked.  All of the designs we had picked out were whims anyway.",0
1400,"this place.\n\nthis place is just..  well its just awesome.\n\nwent there for the first time a couple weeks ago and i'm sorry that i'm just now writing this review, because i can't remember the name of the bartender, but let me tell you about what i DO remember - this guy was incredible.  he honestly made our experience unforgettable and because of him, we will most definitely be going back.  I didnt eat any food, but the 2 people i were with got pizzas, and they seemed to enjoy them.  then of course, there's the beer.  now, i'm not a huge beer drinker, but if i was, this place would be my go to.  sure there are other great places to grab a local (or not-so-local) beer, but how many of them are brewed and served inside of a church?  The inside of this place was incredible.  I loved how they kept the church feel to the building, but then, of course, there's all the beer.  \n\nThis place is just a really great, different kind of place to go grab a drink and some food, and, if your lucky, arguably the best bartender in PGH.",1
1401,"Again this review is not about show but how you get treated with general admission ticket. I arrived at show 45 min before show opens with general admission ticket. Still got last seat.

Will never go again there.",0
1402,"I like Goldies and we take out often because the food is usually good but, honestly, they cannot get orders correct. Every single take out order is wrong. either they forget something or they undercook something, like wings that are called in to be well done.

Again the food is good but, under these circumstances, we will go elsewhere.",0
1403,"Waited less than 10 minutes at 8:45 am on a Saturday for a table outside (had the dog with us). Waitlist sends you a quick text when the table is ready - and the text includes a link to the menu. Nice touch. We were quickly served - had tofu scramble, wife had breakfast burrito and soy latte. Food was great. Service was attentive yet unobtrusive. Prices were more than fair for the quality of food served. They have doggie bowls for water if you're there with Fido.\n\nWill definitely return again. Tip from the waitstaff: Arrive well before 9 am on the weekends as it tends to get extremely busy 10:15 am onwards on the weekends. Not a problem for us at all.",1
1404,"This review is for the convention / meeting room facilities. And I am NOT IMPRESSED. In many other cities the Rio's convention and meeting room facilities would be considered downright opulent and something a city would be proud to have for hosting events. In Vegas, it's like yawn, been there, done that, it's a little dated and not all that. \n\nService: Hustle was the word of the day for our visit from the manager we directly worked with. Got service with a smile too. When a technical difficulty came up their IT staff was on the ball with a quick response. I always love that and give it mad praise when you get that kind of service. \n\nFood: The food was average. Pretty to look at, slow to get on the table, servers didn't pay attention and were sloppy in getting food on and off the tables and it is insulting to tea to lump their so called offering into the category of tea. Bleech. \n\nBut that's where the positive comments come to a halt. Seriously if you're paying premium money to rent a room for an event and they roll out a cheap projector that is broken to the point they put a 9 volt battery under one corner of it so it would project a level image onto the screen? Seriously? Of all the comps I've ever received in Vegas, a 9 volt battery to fix junk equipment is the worst on the list. (See the picture, you can't make this stuff up.)\n\nIf you forget a clicker for your Powerpoint, it's a cool $125 a day rental for something I could have bought for half price had I had the time to grab a cab and run to Fry's to buy one (including the cab fare and cabbie tip). I ended up making changes so it wasn't needed but the price they quoted takes \""""FLEECING\"""" to a whole other level. \n\nWhen I compare the Gold Coast to the Rio in terms of price vs. square footage, quality of the space, quality of the A/V equipment, and yes even the staff, the Gold Coast quite frankly kicks the Rio's ass HARD. Anyone renting space for a meeting and considering the Rio needs to think long and hard about it as most likely they are not receiving the best value for their money. \n\n2 Stars, and even the second star is one I'm on the fence about giving. But a placement on my Jackassery list is a must. As yes, I think sticking a braying jackass in place of the Rio's management team would do a better job of handling this place. (Again our one on site rep who I can't name was awesome considering she was working with crappy equipment). Oh and the extra valet we paid for...can someone give those guys some 5 hour energy before letting them loose to retrieve cars? Yeah, not happy. We deserve better. And we'll be getting better.",0
1405,"On the menus it said \""""best brewery in Nevada by the Nevada Brewing Association\"""" or something similar. I believe it, the Heff was amazing! \n\nThe rest of the food was 5 stars as well, only overall the atmosphere was meh and casino-y. \n\nOur group ordered the no-carb chicken, fish and chips (2), a side of baked potato, and two sides of coleslaw. Every single dish was top quality, as good as the best of any you've had. Baked potato was perfectly cooked, and the others' dishes were large-portioned and delicious. Everyone was sharing. \n\nEven the waitress was super friendly and didn't talk too much, she seemed experienced and no-fuss. \n\nThe only downside was that we walked from the Strip, and it was farther than it seemed!!",1

1407,"Ok, so the grand opening hasn't even happened yet for this place, but sorry Im gonna miss it.  Not...\n\nA group of eight of us show up tonight for \""""dinner\"""" and drinks.  We get seated way the hell in the back.  I guess we didn't fit in with the rest of the crowd.  Two graphic designers, three filmmakers, a photographer and some friends.. ok?  The reason I point this out is that the waiter lets us know that this place isn't that classy of a place like LeBoca, so the people are.. well... less classy? The guy was digging himself a hole.\n\nSo we order drinks, which seem to take about 10minutes to get to our table.  In the mean time we're looking at our menu and the waiter leaves again for about 10min... he finally shows up and we order from this tiny little menu.   My girlfriend and I order some tacos and chips with guacamole, everyone else orders something a bit similar.  \n\nConversation is picking up while we wait for our food.  I see people coming and going and that's when we notice that our food is taking too damn long.  Finally after eating our small plate of chips and guacamole our food arrives. Probably about 45min later.  Here's the best part....\n\nSo the food shows up and after waiting for 45minutes, we get these tiny little tacos that look like they are from the menu of a 2 year old.  That's right.. each of the three tacos are literally two bites at most each.  Everyone eats their dinner in about 5minutes max..  pathetic.\n\nAfter our tiny little dinner, we ask for our bills..The waiter doesn't think to bring all our bills at once, no.. instead he brings one or two at a time. Guess he wants us to stick around? Who knows.. Finally the two filmmakers get their bill, pay and they leave.. couple other of our friends do the same.  My friend and I stay with our other friend who's still waiting on his bill.  He gets it and notices that his $15 meal was just charged $30 on his credit card.  He complains and the waiter vanishes for about 20minutes to fix his card.  When he comes back he gives some crap about fixing it and giving him a credit.. guess how much? Oh about 50 cents.. \n\nHe signed the slip and the remaining three of us left this crappy place.\n\nThe place actually does look pretty cool.  Too bad the service sucks and the food is barely appetizer quality at best.",0

Note that I have NOT been to some of the Walmarts up North (Huntersville, etc.) but this is in comparison to everything West, East and South of Uptown.",1
1409,"Been coming here since open late 2011 and I will never step my foot into another barber shop. The quality, the expertise, and the professionalism were a perfect match with the exceptional taper fade that I usually get. \n\nAbove and beyond.  That about sums it up in 3 words.  Along with the deep shampoo I was given with the cool, minty shampoo (because I had leftover Got2BGlued gunk in my hair) that left me feeling refreshed.  To top off the cut and the razor shave, they give a hot towel massage that left me feeling like a million bucks.  \n\nDefinitely recommend this spot if you're looking for a affordable, quality cut.  \nGood times, good people, and fantastic service",1
1410,"Overall really impressed with the pizza. The food was consistent, not greasy, and clean. The prices are what you would expect. I do not make it downtown to often but would never turn down an opportunity to go to Bianco. I found the best setting is going with a group of friends. Enjoy a good bottle of vino and laugh with friends in a great atmosphere. Nothing negative to say about my experience or the food. Go and enjoy a delightful evening!\n\nBest advice about this style of pizza: \n\n-If you are a Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, or Dominos type of pizza lover you may not enjoy the pizza in the same manner. \n\n- If you are someone who enjoys a more traditional italian roots style pizza you will not be disappointed. Bianco did a great job creating a delicious signature style pizza. Two thumbs up!!!",1
1411,"RUDE - we chose this place from an article a friend read. Our waiter had an attitude, I never knew a vegetable could have NO taste and don't even think about getting two separate checks if they already put it in the computer. Found much better food and service at Olive - I suggest that instead!",0
1412,I'm pretty surprised by the reviews. We have been here more than a handful of timea for lunch and dinner. Food is fresh and plenty. Service is pleasant. Only drawbacks are long wait times for carry out and dine in. Orange chicken and hot sour soup are delicious!,1
1413,"Brand new, but lacking luster.  \n\nThe descriptions on the menu belie the actual appetizers and entrees.  This \""""gastropub\"""" was suggested to me for happy hour by a colleague.  At first appearances the menu suggests interesting twists on standard pub fair, but don't be fooled.  I ordered the \""""dewedged\"""" salad that claims pancetta as an ingredient.  What actually appeared on my plate was cold chewy bacon bits.  The consensus at the table was that the food fell far short of what was touted by the waitress as being made predominantly in-house.\n\nThere's a caveat to the $2 can Tuesday happy hour: It only applies to beers $4.50 and under.  Sadly, the beer selection is limited generally.  The beer selection priced at $4.50 and under forces you to choose from run-of-the-mill beers like Red Stripe, Blue Moon, and Yuengling.\n\nI had a better experience at Industry Public House in Lawrenceville.",0
1414,"Okay, here is the only review you need.  I have been going to this buffet for more than a decade, possibly since its inception when the cost was $16.99, and also hold platinum membership at the Rio.  At that time the lobster and crab legs alone made this place for worth the cost. Then the cost went to $19.99, $24.99, 29.99, and $34.99.  All the while the quality increased at least in proportion with the cost. They added clams, an entire sushi bar, and always had high quality, fresh seafood no matter the preparation.  So, I recently visited once again in March 2008 to find that the buffet was under construction. I was disappointed since this is one of the reasons for my travel to the Rio. However I understood it was probably going to be a nice upgrade so anticipated a subsequent visit. I traveled to this RIo, stayed in an upgrade suite, and went to the buffet that night of arrival. Good night! MAJOR DOWNGRADE. Sushi bar cut in half as to selection, and freshness gone. Lobster - absolute disappointment! They were as small as crawdads and my company mentioned that they were in fact crawdads, and NO I did not mix them up with the crawdad section. Crab legs? Smaller than average and dirt and grime all over the shells, like they were just caught out of filthy infested waters. They upgraded the furniture like some sort of modern city joint - not the nice homely place it was. So to sum this up the buffet is worth $24.99 - not a dime more! Poor quality and lower than average. Better food at Todai, or Onami - franchise type seafood buffets. Side note - rooms poor quality, so overall perhaps this was recessionary effect.",0
1415,I was excited to eat here after reading the reviews. Then I ate there and I was less excited. \n\nI was prepped for some hot spicy New Mexican food. That did not arrive on my plate. It was tasty for sure but I was lead to believe that I would experience the food I grew up with in New Mexico. I didn't. \n\nIt is possible that my expectations were too much for this restaurant to handle.,0
1416,"All The clohes were way over used they all look so over worn.  The prices were over priced for the condition of the clothes ( they were only worth 50 cents tops! ) I was very disappointed were we from out of town and looked at yelp for advise it had 5 stars a place that doesn't deserve 1.  Honestly,  you would be Better off  at a Savwr or any other thrift store. \nAlso the young lady was nice but, not helpful at all soooo lazy just sat behind the counter  and texted on her phone the whole time. \nSorry but this is the truth.",0
1417,"West Coast Plumbing and Air saves the day AGAIN!  I have referred countless clients, family and friends to the very professional staff here and have received only rave reviews.  I have used West Coast for my personal residence and my rental property as well.  Every service call I have requested has been met on time and, at times, even within a couple of hours of my call. Their techs offer honest diagnosis and work hard to minimize repairs and costs; not something you find often in this industry.  There simply is not another HVAC or plumbing company in the Phoenix area that I would use.",1
1418,I went on Thursday and it was 7 dollar medium cheese. Coming from Chicago I was skeptical but the pizza was delicious. The crust was good and it was even good cold later. The waitress was really nice. The only problem was the rif raf that came in. Crowd was somewhat trashy. I would go back if I was in Pitt again.,1
1419,"I was there for dinner.  It was meh.  I had hopes that the food from a little place like this would be surprisingly good. It was Ok, not bad, just OK.  I was most disappointed with the focaccia, mostly because it is namesake of the restaurant and was strongly recommended by a reviewer in a local newspaper when the restaurant first opened.  I also, love bread, non more so than focaccia.  The fococcia, was like evertything else, meh.  It's just there to distract you from how long it takes to bring your entree.  I had high hopes but they were dashed.  \n\nThe night I was there, there was live music by Angelique.  Who was quaint, but also meh.  I appreciated Angelique's efforts, but was disturbed/surprised by the waitress/owner who was talking very loudly with some of her friends at another table, so much so that one couldn't here dear Angelique.  Why have live music, if you're going to talk over them?",0
1420,"First up, great coffee. It's a shame they have such tasty mochas, because here is a place you can get a solid cap or espresso without fear. Just too many decisions. Their homemade whipped cream is amazing, so I often open for the quad-shot con pana to light me up. It's fantastic.\n\nNext up, friendly, smart staff. They always seem extra happy, which may be the constant buzz from the espresso and whipped cream rushes I am sure they cruise on all day.\n\nCap it off with tasty pastries, nice vibe and decor, and it is one of my favorite coffee shops in town.\n\nThe only downside at all is that it's popularity can make it crazy busy, so if you're looking to sit and relax or work for a bit, get there eeeeeeearly.",1
1421,"I first visited the Cake Cafe when I was looking for a cake topper. No other place would sell me a topper without the cake! I was getting married out of state, so ordering the cake would not work. The owner was wonderful. She showed me her book and offered to order one for me with no mark up! Since then, we have come back nearly every weekend. This is a much better value, and flavor than Sprinkles! I will continue to be a loyal customer. I have never been disappointed and am confident I never will be! I have tried almost every flavor, ordered for work, as well as order cakes and a pie! My son loves the Macaroons!",1
1422,"Definitely the best buffet I've had in a while. The place was really well-done, with huge Willy Wonka flower/fruit arrangements all around. Cheery colors and everything looked spotlessly clean. Huge selection of buffet items and most of it was good enough for seconds..or thirds. Sea bass was actually well crusted and really flavorful, so probably one of the few few times I've liked fish at a buffet. I kept going back for the rack of lamb, which was nicely seasoned and cooked to a pink perfectness. Sushi was the only FAIL, but really, you can't expect good or even decent sushi from a buffet ever. I also really liked the crab legs. HUGE suckahs and they weren't too salty from the brining. Dessert aisles were amazing! Tiramisu was the highlight in a cute little glass, but the creme brulee and the caramel rice pudding (weird combo, but it somehow worked) were good also. Ice tea was really tasty, perfumey and refreshing. I kept thinking about it for the thirsty days we were in LV.\n\nOnly drawback was that we were basically told to leave by the waitress since they needed our table for a big group, so dinging them for a star. We were definitely willing to do so, but she hung around and kept dropping not-so-subtle hints about how we should go have a good night...",1

The hummus here was absolutely wonderful; a good traditional creamy hummus.\n\nThe first batch of pita that came with it was nothing special, but the second batch was wonderful. It was hard to believe these came from the same kitchen, but I'm glad we asked for more.\n\nMy wife had the lamb shank dinner and I had the Kofta kebab, and we both agreed that our meat was delicious, but the rice was spectacular. The salad that came with the meal is always like garnish to me; good but nothing special and certainly not the star of the meal.\n\nIf I have the chance I may come back for the lunch buffet, but the dinner was great, even if a little expensive.

1425,"My first time eating Thai food and La's Thai Cuisine and it did not disappoint! \n\nThai food has always been on my list but I never was intrigued enough to go out and try it until now. I'm glad I did because its absolutely delicious! We went during lunchtime on a weekday afternoon and the place was packed! After eating, I can see why. The portions are huge and cheap. What more can you ask for?\n\nWe were given an ordinary salad (ice burg, carrots, and tomatoes)  with a very sweet tasting vinaigrette. Didn't really enjoy it because it was too sweet for my liking but it was free so I shouldn't be complaining [: It took us a long time to order because I am a very indecisive person and everything sounded so good. They had Chinese type dish on their menu which I try not to want because I want to try Thai. \n\nWe end up ordering a peanut curry with chicken and pad thai with tofu. The peanut curry came with rice and the pad thai came with a mix of lettuce and cabbage. Both came with a vegetable eggroll. We asked for medium spicy which was a little bit too spicy for me because I can't tolerate it too much but medium was enough spicy for my friend. Next time, I would definitely go mild. \n\nHow it work is you pick your dish then they ask you to pick your protein. I think its between beef, seafood, chicken, tofu, or vegetable. Then you pick your spice level. \n\nOh and we ended up ordering mango sticky rice for dessert. Sweet sticky rice topped with coconut milk and a side of mango. It was delicious! My friend said it tasted like the one he had in Thailand and when we spoke to the owner, he said he makes the sweet sticky rice fresh everyday [: (I liked the black sweet rice more and my friend likes the white one but whichever one you order should be fine cause they are delicious!)\n\nOverall we enjoy the food very much. I can't wait to try other Thai dishes from here. Only downfall is I live so far away but I found out the owner lives near me out in East Mesa. Poor guy. Commuting must be a pain. I would definitely recommend this place. Now I think I'm brave enough to try other Thai places.\n\nThanks La's Thai Cuisine for giving me such a good first experience!",1

Nice place to catch a game.\n\nApparently there was gonna be food here when they opened, but there never was. It was a perpetual waiting game, and it was always like, \""""yeah, the food/cook is gonna be here in 5 minutes\"""". Eventually, the game ended and yeah, no food.

1429,"Oh my god, Romados, you are so damn good. How I have missed you. Went on a Friday night after a little tennis session and the place, as usual, had a line out the door.

It's great that you can sample as many flavors as you wish (this makes it hard to pick flavors lol.)  I really love this place I'm glad it's so close to home! My favorite flavor is the cookies and cream. I never would have thought this would be my favorite flavor but it's taste is great and it actually has pieces of cookies! Popcorn is a little expensive but the quality and taste are so good it's worth paying a little more. I hope this place is here for the long haul!,1

The decor is nice and warm compared to others (SFO.)\n\nGetting here is very easy and the Cell lot is a great place to wait for arriving passengers.

I didn't know it was mostly a take out place but once I was there decided to give it a try anyhow. I was surprised to see how  reasonable to prices were - great lunch specials. I ordered the Mongolian beef for myself and the Teriyaki chicken bowl for my husband. The food took about 15 minutes so i was confidant everything was cooked to order. Everything was delicious!! I would have given it 5 stars but when i pulled up outside at 11:15am (supposed to open at 11am)  the doors to the place were still locked and lights off... I was about to pull away when the owners showed up and welcomed me in. I am glad  they caught me otherwise I would have missed out!!,1
1440,"Long wait for substandard overpriced food.  Saved a lunch just to try them out, particularly their lobster roll.  The lobster roll is served on a buttered brioche bread, not a roll, which just doesn't taste right and is horrible.  The lobster meat is chopped into tiny pieces with copious amounts of mayonnaise and celery, to the point that there is no lobster flavor and definitely no texture.  The bread is coated with butter and pan fried which produces an oily, sloppy mess.  It's a failure sandwich of disappointment.\n\nAlso tried the lobster chowder in the bread bowl, which was ok but way overpriced for the little amount you get.  My friend ordered the shrimp po boy, which was bad as well.  The shrimp was battered and deep fried then served on a hot dog roll and not good at all.  Why they refused to serve the lobster salad on the bread roll I'll never know (we did ask, the chef refused).  \n\nThe sandwiches come with fries or coleslaw and you can \""""combo\"""" it for $6 which means add a drink. WTH?  If it comes with fries anyway aren't you just paying $6 for a drink then?  Better strategy would be to go to another spot and order a drink separately since they all come from the same coke fountain anyway.  I ordered a coleslaw because my friend went with fries and got fries anyway.  After the 20 min wait for the food I didn't want to go back and exchange.\n\nBottom line: walk across the street to Planet Hollywood's LobsterMe instead for good lobster roll.",0
1441,What a find! My boyfriend did some research and found this place to surprise me. I am so glad he did. The burgers were delicious and the mint chocolate shake was perfection.

Im sorry I honestly just signed the receipt not looking at the price and had no clue that we had only paid for three people. I didnt even know the computer would allow you to play more people than paid for. He was extemely rude and did not want to fix the lanes. At this point I didnt even want to finish playing because he instantly assumed I was purposely not paying.

1444,"During my week-long vacation in Montreal, I had a sushi buffet, an expensive French dinner and large amounts of poutine. Yet, the meal I would have again in a heartbeat, the meal that highlighted my stay, resides in this amazing and humble establishment. \n\nFor a light lunch, my parents and I split a half a chicken and fries. The chicken was perfectly cooked: mind-blowingly flavorful, juicy and enveloped in the crispiest, tastiest skin. Also, the chicken had the perfect level of spiciness, whetting the appetite with each bite. \n\nOn top of this, the fries were a mountain of pillowy potatoes which I would say rivals if not tops Pommes Frites in New York. Once you put one of these babies in your mouth, you can forget about that diet you've been trying to keep because you will not be able to control yourself! \n\nI have to stop now because I'm literally salivating too much.

He told me to put it all away because he had everything he needed already and that he'd look through some different options to make sure I was getting the best discount. After just a few minutes he had everything sorted out, told me I was going to save an additional 10% off of my bill and sent me on my way. He did actually point me toward accessories before I left, but he prefaced it by telling me that my company gets a sweet discount on them. I declined and he thanked me for using Verizon and told me to have a good day. It was a refreshing experience, seeing that so many cell-phone stores are trying to hard-sell everybody on everything. I'll definitely be back to this location!",1
1453,"Given the mixed reviews, I wasn't quite sure to what to expect when I came here recently. And fittingly, I'd say my experience was mixed, although overall positive.\n\nWe went on a Saturday evening, and I thought the place would be hopping, but it was sort of dead. The space is beautiful though, and it was a shame that their charming courtyard beer garden was not being patronized by more people that evening. We were seated indoors in their downstairs area, which was cozy, but a bit dark and dungeon-like. The evening started off on an annoying note when it took about 15 minutes for a waiter to come by and take our drink order (though he was more attentive after that).\n\nOur waiter was hilariously blunt. Several times when we tried to order something, he shot us down with his unsolicited (though actually appreciated) opinion:\n\nUs: \""""We'll try the mussels to start.\""""\nWaiter (with horrifying look): \""""No, you don't want to order those. They are really sandy.\""""\nUs: \""""Umm, ok, thanks for the heads up. How about the peanut butter and jelly wings?\""""\nWaiter (gives knowing glance): \""""How do you THINK wings with peanut butter and jelly would taste? Don't get those.\""""\n\nLater for our meal order:\n\nFriend: \""""I'll have the rabbit for dinner.\""""\nWaiter (same horrifying look as before): \""""No, no good. Literally ANYTHING else would be a better choice.\""""\n\nThough it was a bit odd, we did appreciate his candor about the food and I know he was just trying to be helpful. Also it gave us plenty to giggle about every time he left the table.\n\nAnyway, speaking of the food, waiter man's tips were fairly solid, because we were pleased with almost everything we ordered. To start, we sampled the Black BBQ wings, which were meaty, juicy, and crispy. We also tried the pierogies, which were good, though nothing noteworthy (I can think of about a dozen places off of the top of my head that serve a better pierogie). On the annoying side, they only gave 3 pierogies in the appetizer serving, which for $7 bucks seems a little stingy. Also, 3 is an odd number of anything for an appetizer, as most dining parties are 2 or 4 people (ours was 4). Thanks for creating an awkward sharing situation, Penn Brewery. Anyhow, we also tried the pretzel and bier cheese, which everyone at the table liked except for yours truly (I found the stiff mousse-y texture of the cheese to be unappetizing).\n\nFor our meal, my husband and I split the chicken kasespaetzle, which appears to be Germany's answer to mac n' cheese. It was really tasty, with a rich, creamy, tangy and flavorful sauce, plenty of juicy chicken, and tender pasta dumplings. Our friends split the roasted pork, which they reported to be delicious as well. Entree portions were generous and more than enough for us to split and still feel full and happy (especially given the appetizers we had). For dessert, we shared the apple strudel, and our waiter was quite pleased.\n\n\""""GREAT choice, that's the best dessert we have!\"""" he exclaimed a little too enthusiastically after we ordered it. \n\nThanks, waiter, glad we finally could nail it on the first try. And nail it we did -- the strudel was heavenly. Flaky pastry crust and warm, soft apple filling paired with melty vanilla ice cream was the perfect way to end our meal. Very good experience overall. Or should I say, \""""sehr gut\"""" experience overall.",0
1454,"Alright...bullet points on this one:\n\n1.  Nice looking hotel at very nice prices\n2.  Standard rooms comes with a TV from about 1992 and it is 13 inches or so?  That's okay...you should not be in your room watching TV.  You should be in there to nurse a hangover. \n3.  Slow drain in the sinks in some of the rooms, but not in ours.\n4.  $10 Pai Gow tables make me supremely happy\n5.  Nice and efficient cocktail waitresses on the casino floor\n6.  What???  Sam Adams is the darkest beer you have?  No Newcastle?  No Guinness? BAH!\n7.  The buffet food for weddings (should you decide to have a wedding here or you are a guest at one) is A-MAY-ZING!  Seriously good, quality food and a whole table of desserts in addition to the cake.\n8.  The Frank Caliendo Show advertisements on repeat in every elevator was god damn annoying.  I wanted to punch those little TV screens after a few trips.\n9.  Don't ever order at a bar in the Casino, unless you are playing video poker - it cost us $16 for a bottle of Sam Adams and a Jack & Coke.  I am too cheap for that nonsense and I should've known better.\n10.  Excellent location on The Strip!\n\nAll in all, this is now on my list of hotels I would stay at again and will keep in the rotation on where to stay in Vegas.",1
1455,"So I wasn't so excited about going to this place, it just didn't seem like my kind of place. Atlas, at the insistence of someone else, we went. And yuck. Well, while we were standing in line, there was a big menu-esque thing describing all the different stations they had, and it sort of got me excited. I planned on filling up on sushi and sea food. So we get in, and the buffet is literally about ten feet long, that's it. Each station consisted of one food item. Sure I was happy to see the big mound of shrimp and crab legs, but it ended up grossing me out instead. How long have they been sitting out, exactly? I don't know, but the shrimp still had the shell on them, and, it was a little fishy. Fishy seafood is a no-no.\n\nI didn't even enjoy the desert buffet. Although I had two dinner rolls, that's pretty much what I filled up on. But you can't really screw up dinner rolls, can you? (knock on wood)\n\nI don't plan on going back, or even recommend anyone else going there. \n\nBut I did see Donnie Osmond in person! Not that I had anything to say to the guy, I mean, exactly what is he famous for? Anyway, I would've hoped he'd have better taste in food than the buffet at Flamingo...",0

1458,"This place really, really sucks. The 'waiter' would have been better off as a Wal-Mart greeter: he's certainly the right age, and while he did greet us, he never actually did the job of a waiter. Since he wouldn't come back to take our order, we waved down some other hapless worker and at least she brought the food out also. Luckily we had a long layover; if it was short we would never have made it. \nSadly, we were there long enough to get served. A pulled pork sandwich, of sorts at least. Since I couldn't pick it up due to the soggy bun, I don't know if it qualifies. The wife ordered a hamburger, which, as the menu stipulates, one can either get medium well or well done. Medium? Nope, can't do it. \nThere are plenty of tvs about, but you won't be hearing the games. Instead, I hope you like Nickelback; you'll hear lots of it and bland, inoffensive wuss rock of that ilk. \nAnd one final thing I didn't like was being carded (I'm in my late thirties and look it). The waiter also carded a woman old enough to be my mother (I'd guess 65 yrs old) at the next table. Why? Just following the rules! Is there really no point where employees can use even the slightest bit of common sense?\nThe Phoenix airport appears to have a real lack of possibilities in the restaurant/bar category. When it comes to Fox Sports Grill/Sky Box (whatever), you'd be better off going hungry.",0

Helen did everything I wanted for my nails. I'm still in awe at the filing and shaping. Plus you know your nails are good when you cannot stop looking at them because they're that amazing.

I returned the vehicle on May 25, 2014 only to be charged $415.75 and was being charged $44.00 per day. When I called to figure out why I was being charged an additional $245.75 I was told that the blonde lady who rented me the car up sold me on services I did not agree too. In fact, the whole time I was there I told her I could not afford more then $200.00 and she assured me that $170.67 is all I would be charge. Every question I asked she lied about costing me an additional $245.75. She lied about what would happen if I returned the car early and the amount of the rental.

They do have plenty of bars spread around so that in itself gets a star. \n\nSpeaking of that, after i bought a drink from the bar on the right corner, I turned my head to see a what seemed like a 200+ lb black guy swapping mad spit with a skinny little white guy and grabbing each others...ugh wtf!!

1466,"My eyes on your eyes\nLike Peter Pan up in the sky\nMy best friend's house tonight\nLet's bump the beats till beddy-bye at DOCG! - Group Love (tongue tied)\n\nThe foremost reason we ate here was because we were staying at the Cosmopolitan and it's conveniently located outside of the room elevators. I thought that I had tried every restaurant at this hotel that I wanted to already, and I mistakenly tried to fit one more new experience in. You only get two or three dinners per Vegas trip so you better choose wisely. I'm usually a stubborn person but I also am willing to admit when I make obvious mistakes, and this was my fault.\n\nA few of their small plates, the grilled octopus and the crispy pork belly, were presented pretty nicely but just didn't hit the mark flavor wise. The ratio of each component felt off. I ordered the PICI pasta that came with braised duck sauce and truffles. When it came out, it seemed like it had sat in the line and got a little cold. The sauce was also a tad overpowering.\n\nI'm almost certain they share a kitchen with Scarpetta next door as they are both Scott Conan's restaurants. I absolutely rave about the pasta at Scarpetta but this was an entirely different experience. Maybe we should've tried their pizza but the small plates weren't impressive either. DOCG to me stands for 'Don't Overthink Cause Golly!' Stop by for a drink, but eat elsewhere.",0

1468,"Club Tanning was the site of my very first bed tanning experience, and I'm very happy to say that it was pretty sweet. Katie the desk girl was great, answering my hundreds of questions cheerfully and being totally helpful without attempting to sell me anything I didn't inquire about. \n   The salon itself was clean, and the prices and products were laid out very plainly. On your first visit you fill out one sheet of paperwork warning about medications that can cause a bad reaction when tanning, then you choose your desired package and are given a room number. The rooms are simple, they have an empty lotion bottle that says the room has been cleaned, a couple of towels, a pair of those little goggle things, a chair, a mirror, a fan and some headphones for your music of choice. You push a button on the wall that turns the bed on and starts your timer, then lie down or stay standing for your desired time and you're done. Clean up and leave, they'll even hold your bronzer or whatever you have if you'd like. \n   This is my first membership to a tanning salon, so I can't really compare prices, but it seems fair to me, I think unlimited tanning starts at 30 a month, or you can pay for each visit standalone. \nI know this seems a little long winded, but I went in to this totally clueless, so if you're new to tanning I completely recommend Club Tanning, the staff is helpful, the salon is clean and the whole first time process is as simple as it could be.",1

Omg, delicious. I love anything with chocolate fudgggeeee. This sundae is sensational.  The marshmallow cream is sweet, yet decadent it something I have never tasted before.  \nI can easily eat three orders of this sundae.  The size of the sundae is pretty large it is made for sharing of two.

Reason I love this sundae because it has hot fudge. mmmmmhhh.  The chocolate cake is a little too sweet for me, but the vanilla ice cream compliments it very well.  If you love chocolate this would be the one for you. \n\n\nAnother Sundae I have tried is the  Grasshopper Marshmallow Mint Explosion \nWhich includes a mint chocolate chip ice creams with  Marshmallow Sauce & Hot Fudge & it is topped off with whipped cream & chocolate mints.  When I first saw this sundae it looked like grass and I would think it tasted like those wheat-grass shots you would take at a gym or some health store.. With that being said, I liked it but the way they made it was very much like a milkshake for some reason? \n\nOverall, the food there is okay I dont really recommend eating there.

I live about 7 miles away, so it is a minor trek to get there and why that is no fault of theirs, I always leave hoping the food makes up for the lousy attitudes by the majority of sandwich makers. The same crew of about 5 or 6 have been there for that entire stretch. I never feel welcomed and often feel like I am inconveniencing them to make my sandwich.

1478,"I've been going to this theatre ever since it opened.   It's been my favorite theatre here in Las Vegas.  The location of Rave Motion Pictures for me is a sure plus. Because at Town Square there is lots to do, shopping, eating, drinking, or just hangout and to do a little browsing, here and there. I was just going to give it a 4 star rating. But I now rate it at 5 stars all the way.  I recently discovered that Rave Motion Pictures has (ages 21 and up) shows.  So when you're looking at Showtimes, look for the shows that have (21+) next to the movie title.  This means you can order cocktails/alcohol beverages inside the theatre itself from a cocktail server. Cash or Credit Cards accepted. I was so happy to find that out.  So I order a Jack on the rocks. The Bar is located to the left of where you give your tickets. The Lounge area on the side. I'm not sure if you can buy the drinks straight from the bar, I'll have to get back on that one.  But if we can buy from the bar too.  That would make it even better.  Finally you can drink cocktails inside the theatre.  The seats are reserved seating, so when you get your tickets at the window, you can choose where to sit. Upon entering the theatre you will be shown to you seats. The seat number(s) you chose will be on your ticket stub. This kinda works because people won't usually get  seats next to you, if the show isn't too crowded.

Here's my unecessarily lengthy analogy: You know when you make grilled cheese (and c'mon, everyone makes 2 at a time, how could you eat just one?) and the first one comes out perfect but the second one comes out kinda messed up because the pan is probably too hot and there's not enough butter to help the bread brown correctly and the cheese doesn't fully melt because the thing is going to burn if you leave it on any longer? Well this is how my pizza was, it seemed hastily cooked over too high heat and lacked flavor. Not to mention the sauce was bland and the cheese was amorphous and too stringy. There was exactly one basil leaf on my pizza too and it was burnt to a crisp. All in all, a poor excuse for something so full of itself.

So stellt sich also der durchschnittliche Gast ein spanisches Restaurant vor? Das denken anscheinend die Erfinder dieser Art von Gastronomie.\n\n\n Was es sonst von unserem Besuch zu berichten gibt, ist leider nicht besser.\n\n\n Nach 15 Minuten stelle ich fest, dass die Herren an dem einen Nachbartisch untereinander spanisch reden, mit dem Kellner dagegen englisch.\n\n\n Nach 20 Minuten wundere ich mich, dass noch nicht mal Brot auf dem Tisch steht, obwohl die Gl\u00e4ser l\u00e4ngst wieder leer sind und bekomme als Kommentar vom Nachbartisch, ich solle erst mal warten bis das Essen kommt, bevor ich mich beschwere.\n\n\n Als ich 25 Minuten nach der Bestellung den Kellner frage, warum man nicht zumindest Aioli mit Brot servieren k\u00f6nne, erkl\u00e4rt dieser, dass es nicht am fehlenden Personal liege, sondern daran, dass der Grill nicht ausreiche, um die Bestellungen schneller zu bearbeiten. Als ich ihm erkl\u00e4re, dass Aioli nicht vom Grill kommt, geht er freundlicherweise in die K\u00fcche und bringt das Aioli mit Brot (1,80 EUR).\n\n\n Leider.

Die Geschmacksrichtung der Br\u00fche, die sich nach einigen Minuten am Boden der Pfanne sammelte, l\u00e4sst sich recht gut als Knorr-Fertigpfanne-Paella beschreiben. Und selbst dieses Gericht kam nicht ohne Zusatzstoffe aus.\n\n\n Das Selters war gut, die Sangria ok. Die Bedienung war gut, wirklich freundlich und dem Kellner ist seine Loyalit\u00e4t gegen\u00fcber der K\u00fcche zugute zu halten. Er beharrte darauf, dass dort tats\u00e4chlich gekocht wird. Ich w\u00fcrde es - zumindest anhand der Gerichte, die wir versucht haben - eher als auftauen, anr\u00fchren, aufw\u00e4rmen, in-so\u00dfe-tunken und aus dem Eimer sch\u00f6pfen bezeichen. Aber immerhin wird man schnell satt.\n\n\n Der Innenhof ist noch so sch\u00f6n, wie zu Weinbrenner-Zeiten und war dementsprechend voll.\n\n\n Wer aber noch wei\u00df, wie selber gekochtes Essen schmeckt, sollte diesen Platz unbedingt meiden. Man kann auch drau\u00dfen sitzen und anst\u00e4ndig essen.",0
1484,"Please do not waste your time. I am warning you. It is nothing like the website or a restaurant at all. It is merely a store front that has some meat in the back. Although there was a menu with several options we were only given two. They were ill prepared for dinner service but I can imagine the lunch is any better. I ordered the doner kebab on turkish bread and received it on a wrap. After returning the wrap I then received the flavorless meat on soggy bread with no sauce. It was not even edible. I was happy that they did not charge for this mess however they made their money off of a beer they charged us $5 for. The worst part is the website that is so deceiving. We were served food in styrofoam! Sitting in an alley with broken glass and a stereo playing bad music loudly. If you want to experience a little bit of Turkey, I guess the only option you have is to go to Turkey.",0
1485,There's lots of good things to say about this cafe.\n\n1) Small but lots of seating. Cozy.\n2) Wonderful espresso\n3) Nice baristas\n4) Very convenient location\n5) Prices are competitive\n\nReminds me of cafes that I used to visit a lot when I lived in a smaller city.  I defintely recommend!,1
1486,"I did not like eating here! Food was below-average quality. Sushi had no flavor - the only thing you can taste is the mayo sauce they squeeze all over ALL of the rolls. The Mongolian BBQ has no flavor (there's no sauces for you to choose like at a real MBBQ joint), lots of fried food (cheap), what fresh fish they did have (shrimp) I just didn't trust. Service makes you feel like you're an imposition. Signs all over the walls about the ramifications if you waste food. Jeeze. Never going here again. A friend talked me into going... next time I PICK THE RESTAURANT.",0
1487,"Hipster alert!!!\n\nI went there recently with the intention of getting a salad. Unfortunately I couldn't find anything that resembled one.  All of them included fruit (i.e. pears, mango) and a list of exotic ingredients, including dressings such as jalapeno cucumber raspberry vinaigrette (come on). It would seem that this place is trying way too hard. It's one thing to offer new foods and exciting twists on traditional stuff, but it's another to just throw together a bunch of unique-sounding ingredients in hopes to dupe the next bohemian with an identity crisis into overpriced mediocrity.  If the hipsters of Ahwatukee would just get over themselves this place wouldn't be all that popular.",0
1488,"Everything we ate was fabulous!! One in our party is gluten free and her pizza was fantastic (mushroom and truffle oil). I had the borrata and pesto pizza and another had arugula and pear. Our waiter, Matt, was very knowledgeable about the menu and about the wine. I'm originally from Austin and am used to a wider selection of beers but other than that, top notch!",1
1489,i didnt like it at all.. i read some of the reviews and they were all saying its good but when i went it was so expensive and the food wasnt all that great. ive been to a better all you can eat sushi place before and they were way cheaper and had more variety. the lunch was 25 and the other place i went to lunch was 15 and had oysters and raw food. this place doesnt give u oysters till dinner. the other place is sushi kaya try there is better and worth the drive. its off spring mountain and arville.,0
1490,"Yes, I am reviewing a Starbucks. \nThe reason for this review was for the exceptional service I received here this past weekend. \nMy wife has been saving the points up on her Starbucks rewards card (a gold card). It turns out that you have to cash in free drinks within 30 days on your card now, and they can not be stored and used when ever you like.\nSo instead of have multiple free drinks on her card for us to use, we only had 1 free one.\nThe employee at the counter explained this new rule to us, and still hooked us up with a second free drink any size/ any kind of our choice. \nIt was truly awesome customer service!\nSo thank you lady employee behind the register this last Easter Sunday around noon.\n\nOther things I noticed about this Starbucks, it was very clean, a well organized pastry/muffin area.\nThere is no drive thru, so that kinda sucks.\nI counted at least 3 people working behind the counter, so staffed properly.\nOur drinks were made quick and tasted great!\n\n4 out of 5 only because it is a Starbucks and there are just so many of them (its not original). \nAgain, excellent customer service!",1
1491,"Red Robin is a pretty awesome place to go for any occasion. My California Chicken Burger was delicious! I also had a mint chocolate chip milky milkshake which was AHMAAAZING!\n\nCan't complain. The atmosphere was super retro and clean. I love how the walls are decorated with pictures. There were flat screen TVs...that was entertaining! This may sound weird, but the seats were super comfy.\n\nOur waiter was good. He was a good server but just a little bit unfriendly? Maybe he was just on an off day or something...\n\nMy experience with Red Robin was overall great! I would recommend this to a friend!:)",1
1492,"Much of my criticism and compliments have already been detailed very nicely by others, so I will just summarize in bullet points.\n\n1. Great location for walkers, inconvenient for those driving from other neighborhoods. Given that it is geared toward the neighborhood and repeat customer base... (see number 2)\n2. Very limited menu selection. Literally turned the menu over to see what was on the back, only to find it empty, thought to myself, 'is this a kids' menu?' Turns out that is what everyone at the table was thinking too.\n3. In response to my request for a drink list, our server replied, \""""We have every beer you can think of in bottle.\"""" False. Who wants to play the game, \""""Do you have {insert beer}\"""" repeatedly in a noisy crowded restaurant? Write it down or memorize it and be able to tell me all of them.\n4. A basket of individually wrapped saltine crackers like one would find at a salad bar is NOT an acceptable bread item to serve with hot crab dip. Just cut the carrots and celery into adult human size, give enough of them, and/or add some nice crostini.\n5. The clam chowder is very good.\n6. The shrimp fritters are pretty good.\n\nI am interested to see if the owners read their own reviews and improve the quality of food and service. It really is a great location, and I so eagerly awaited their opening.",0
1493,"So excited to be close to a Sprouts again. Their produce is wonderful, and inexpensive. Love the music playing from speakers in the parking lot. I was pleasantly surprised to see how large this store is. Many checkout lanes as well. \nThey were making sushi right in the store, and the quality looked top notch. Had to get some. Yum! Also got some frozen beef tamales, as recommended by another customer. They were amazing! Besides the veggies, I love their bulk spices. I found those over by the baking aisle on an end cap. Along with spices, they also had a few different loose teas. Very affordable. \nCan't wait to come here again next week!",1
1494,"I had way high hopes for this place and honestly, the flavor I had was gross. No other way to describe it. And I'm not sure how, because it seems like it would be hard to make Kahlua gross. But it was. \nThe service wasn't super, either. It was 8:30 on a Saturday night and we were the only ones in there. And it was like she was on a mission to get us to pick a flavor and get out as quickly as possible. \nI love booze and ice cream, but that's probably the last time I'll do them together. And that in itself is probably for the best.",0
1495,"Came here on a Tues night at 6pm. Warning. If your coming after 6pm, make a reservation! We were a party of 5 and were lucky to get in. They did accommodate us, but told us we had to leave by 7.  This place got so crowded at 6pm!! Full house! Legit Japanese place. My folks had the ramen, and I had a chicken egg bowl plus a few skewers on the side. Traditional Japanese recipes coming from someone who is Japanese.My folks came with me. They ordered the ramen, but preferred Monta Ramen better.( see my review on them) \nService was a bit hectic, but the place was packed so I don't blame them. Foo",1
1496,This tea/coffee house looks quite quaint from the outside and it looked full of promise. Inside is nice enough but i wasn't impressed. The two cakes me and my son had were warmed up i think to mask the dryness of them i had a coffee cake slice and my son had a chocolate muffin these cakes don't need heated up we had soft drinks and my friend had a coffee. Don't think i'll be trying again and oh the staff seemed kind of awkward not really that friendly although the owner himself seemed very nice!,0
1497,"I live in a city (Santa Cruz, CA) where a much much worse theater is the only venue for the sorta indie movies that come here.  This place is clearly very yuppy... and I don't know if they do it anymore but when I went there a year ago, some worker introduced the movie... it was a little weird, but I guess it would remind me of the Sundance Film Festival if I had ever gone there.  The seats were comfy and the audio/video was pretty good.  Yeah... expensive.  I'd probably not go there as often as cheaper theaters.  But it's still a really nice place to go see a movie and maybe the cost can keep away a few of the loud jackasses you don't want at the movies.",1
1498,"I really couldn't ask for anything more... from a tire store. I mean, free cognac and dancers on poles would be nice, but these guys are here to move some rubber and that's what they do.\n\nThey are efficient and professional--I brought my car in for four tires and I was out in under an hour. They do offer many other services, but I politely declined. I like that they ask first though--I hate taking my car in for one specific thing only to have the salesperson come back with a list of other unrelated items they are more than happy to handle for me. Just tires, thanks. They also present several options for tires, and don't just try to stick you with the most expensive ones while pretending they don't have anything cheaper. Again, kudos!\n\nThe thing that impressed me the most was that it turned out they only had three of the tire they sold me--so the manager upgraded me to the next level of tires for no additional cost. The tires now on my car were $20 more/ea than the ones I paid for.\n\nGood people here--perhaps I'll return for other services.",1
1499,"Cool place.  Only been here for lunch but never had a bad experience.  Food comes out quickly too.\n\nPlaced an order to go recently and came to find out the prices on their menu online aren't the same as the menus at the restaurant.  Wasn't that big of a deal, couple extra bucks doesn't hurt but just something to point out.\n\nCheers!",1
1500,"We stayed here, five people in one room. We drove in the middle of the night and arrived at 9:30AM in Las Vegas. We decided to try to check in early. They did have a room ready for us, actually upgraded to a higher floor that overlooked the strip AND took $50 off the bill. Not quite sure why, but hey, we're not going to argue.\n\nThe room was clean, didn't smell like smoke (even though some hotels say the rooms are non-smoking, they still smell). The house keeping cleaned up well everyday. The beds were comfy and the bathroom fit two of us at a time for getting ready. \n\nYes, you could hear groups of people when they walked by...but it didn't wake us up or anything. The room served the purpose -- we slept, we pre-gamed, we got ready to go to the clubs. \n\nThe parking garage was close...make sure you park on level 2, then you don't have to ride the elevator or climb the stairs to get to the casino entrance. \n\nThe food court is really what sold our group. Starbucks, Subway, Rubio's. Sbarro, McDonalds. We ate here at least once per day. Real savings on food, if you're not looking to spend a lot at hotel restaurants. \n\nIt was too cold to go swimming, so we didn't see the pool. But we are fans of this hotel and will probably stay again. You can't beat the price.",1
1501,"I was finally able to satisfy my drought for decent Mexican food when some friends took me here for dinner! Let me tell you there are Rey few Mexican food options in Honolulu and I was quite happy with this place. A bit chaotic up front, no one seems to know how to place an order. Way too many options and permutations on items to order! However, when the food finally comes (and it comes quick), its really awesome! I tried the combination dish with carne asana along with the pork fried rice. Awesome!",1
1502,"I have been a regular customer for years, but tonight put me over the edge.  Walked in and got seated, waitress took my drink order while I was waiting for my friend. My friend arrived and placed his drink order, his beer took a while to get to table, we both ordered on separate bills, he ordered a 1/4 sandwich and I ordered a half sandwich, His sandwich came 10 minutes before mine, but they brought him a half instead of a quarter, She apologized and said she would only charge him for the 1/4 sandwich.  My order came the food was good but she never brought my side of hot peppers, I also did not get a refill on my tea.  When it was time to get the bill, she told my friend if he took the other part of his sandwich home with him the manager said he would have to be charged for it.  We were stunned, they would rather throw it away instead of giving it to the customer which you gave the wrong order to in the first place, also on his bill they put the wrong price for his beer, that was corrected.  This is not the first time in the last couple of visits that the service was off, or the wrong orders came.  I will take a long break before I go back into Uncle Sam's again, the same with my friend, we probably average going in there about 5 times a month, not anymore, I guess we should have requested one of the waitresses that we know are good servers there like Tiffany, we probably wouldn't have had a problem, but the wise manager I guess does not want our business anymore so we won't spend our money there for a long while.  Maybe they will get their act straight or either we'll see Jon Taffer in there soon.\n\nP.S. On one other occasion I walked out because after waiting and not getting my drink after 12 minutes I decided to go somewhere else, So it is my fault for giving them another chance too soon.",0
1503,"I love this place!!! Better than the other huge franchise in the valley. The cashier is so sweet and the food is always great. I hesitated going for awhile, because from the street it's not that impressive and if you're from here you know that getting good food here is a crap shoot. But I was running late one day so gave it a shot. The carne asada burrito is so good and the rolled taco supreme is just beyond words. Tricky to eat, but amazing. Wasn't crazy about their milk cake though, it was soggy, like it had been frozen and defrosted",1
1504,"Most UNAUTHENTIC spanish restaurant I've ever been to.  Stopped in for a drink and tapas and left after the drink.  The whole ambiance just isn't there. Based on other reviews, I'm pretty sure I didn't miss out on a whole lot.",0
1505,Unfortunately this place isn't what I was hoping for. The food is good and the cooks are great but front of house is really not knowledgable on their food. This is suppose to be a health kitchen so they should be able to modify my meals to what I need but simply don't know how. When asked what kind of squash is in one of ther signature dishes their response is idk. How do you not know? And if you don't why can't you find out? Same thing when asked what white dishes do you guys have? Is there oil in that sauce? What about sugar? These things are important for people on specific meal plans. It's frustrating when you do not know anything and seem too annoyed to find out. Though the food is good I'm afraid to eat it in fear that it will have something I specified I can't have. Both times I've been here had the same issue with the same girl. They need to be more knowledgable.,0
1506,"I wish I had better things to say, BUT we won't ever return here. And thats with 25 dollar rooms.\nIt's the smokiest casino that I've walked through in Vegas and left us feeling ill from breathing it in each time we walked to and from our room.",0
1507,"I cannot express how terrible the service was during brunch.  Our waiter completely ignored us, served all the tables around us even stopped to chat basketball with the teen next to us and flirt with the table of 30 something women next to us while our drinks were empty and we had plates piled on the table.  He brought refills and the off the buffet orders to everyone else, we never received our second off the buffet order, after over 30 minutes of waiting we gave up and asked for our check.  The dish staff brought us refills after passing our table a few times.  The food is great but we won't be going back.",0
1508,"This is one of the better International airports in America.  The baggage unloading can be a slow process at times, but security lines, especially in the Delta terminal, go by in a flash!  My flights have always left on time, and I really, really appreciate the free WiFi!\n\nPHX is great!",1
1509,While the ice cream looked delicious - there was no frozen yogurt.  I was led astray!  But this place sure is popular - the line was out the door.  I am on a quest for a local yogurt joint - not sure why Yelp lists this as both a yogurt & ice cream shop.,0
1510,"Number two isn't a bad place to be, and Caesar's is my 2nd favorite hotel on the Strip. \n\nI stayed here for a conference a few years ago and had a great room with a terrific shower.  The pool was awesome as well and staff were friendly.  There were a ton of dining options, lots of shopping and the place was clean and didn't stink like smoke like some of the other casinos.\n\nIf I came back on personal vacation, I'd definitely stay here.",1
1511,"I think it's a reliable mean of transportation here. It's a good idea to commute with monorail when the traffic was jammed. \n\nBut I think cabs, buses and cars are much better when traffic wasn't bad. I bought a 24 bus ticket for $5. And I didn't have to walk long way through hotel to the monorail stations.\n\nAlso renting a car isn't cost much, there are free parking in every hotel here.",1
1512,"The awesome duo that was performing got our attention. We had an hour to burn before a show so alcohol + good live music made absolute sense. We had a round of free drinks because of our show tickets.\n\nWe claimed our drinks at the bar. Chilled there for a bit while I was watching the playoffs. After finishing our first round, we moved to a table right in front of the stage...just so I could fall asleep! I hope I wasn't snoring. I couldn't even remember the name of the performers and what they were playing but I'm pretty sure it happened. All that matters is that the people I was with who stayed awake enjoyed the music and had a good time.",1
1513,"Joe is worth the 20 min we drove from our hotel. Joe, the owner -- coolest 67 year old Bostonian we have ever met. The man oozes passion for his shop and the food reflects that. Our family of seven devoured our food, and I was on the verge of tears eating the first fried zucchini and mushrooms I've had in four years!  Gluten free foodies will relish eating FRESH fish and chips instead of the frozen stuff we're typically banished to!  A wonderful experience for the whole family. Highly recommend it.",1
1514,"This place is, by far, my favorite sushi joint in Pittsburgh. I stop in at least once or twice a week for lunch and always walk away happy.\n\nThey sell prepared bento boxes (made fresh each day), as well as a handful of hot Japanese entrees (chicken teriyaki, udong). I've never had anything here I didn't love, but I'm personally partial to the rainbow roll, Oxford roll, and inari (stuffed fried tofu). If you're not very hungry, the salmon or cucumber maki are light and tasty.\n\nThe family that runs the place and their employees are some of the friendliest people, and always stop to ask how you're doing and how your meal was.\n\nIn terms of ambience, well, it's a food court, but the restaurant itself is fairly isolated. I've had a few lunch meetings here and haven't had a problem with it being too loud, even when it's busy.\n\nPrices are decent - I usually wind up paying around $15 for a roll and a drink. The only downside is that they don't take credit cards, so bring cash.",1
1515,"If I could regurgitate that meal I would! I have passed by this place a million times and thought, 'oh this looks appetizing'. Not only was it not appetizing, but it was the most flavorless food I have tasted since English Pub fare! Mamita's touts itself as authentic Mexican and Cuban Cuisine but it's swill. I chose the Masa de Puerco Fritas and the meat was nothing but fat chunks. There was hardly any meat on my plate and the meat that was there was super dry. The onions were over cooked and they even had the nerve to placed wilted lettuce on my plate. They forgot my black beans and when the waitress finally brought them, I took one bite and spit them out. They had so much cumin in them it was inedible. The waitresses seemed uninterested in doing a good job and it pained my party and I to even leave any kind of tip. After much discussion, we left less than 10% of our bill for every time we had to ask for the same thing over and over, every time we had to spit something inedible back on our plate, and the general disgusting atmosphere of the entire establishment. I decided the only reason this place ever received any good reviews is because the person or persons were intoxicated and didn't know any better. But I was completely sober and as God as my witness, I will not patronize that place again even if I am drunk and that is the last place open!",0
1516,"Next time you're stuck in traffic on the 51 and Glendale, look just off the freeway and you'll see desert mountains flirting with your urge to get outside and spend the day exploring NATURE... da ba dee da ba doo. (That's right, SNL Robert Goulet reference) \n\nWhen the weather's nice, I spend as much of my time outdoors as I possibly can. I look at it like the camel filling himself with water for his desert hike, or the bear filling his belly with food for a long winter of hibernation because I know that when July and August hits...I'll be merely dreaming about the outdoors. So, Piestewa Peak (formerly known as Squaw Peak) is one of my favorite outdoor destinations. \n\nOk, so there are a couple routes you can take at Piestewa Peak and that's what I love about this area. If you're in the cardio mood, you can climb the peak and get the stair master workout. When you get to the rocky top, it's pretty awesome staring out and seeing the city on one side and a desert preserve on the other. \n\nIf you're in the mood for a flatter hike through the desert oasis itself, then park in the way back and take the path you see on the north side. Between the saguaros and the rolling peaks and valleys, it's a gorgeous hike. You could easily keep walking until the sun sets so keep an eye on the clock and remember the direction you took. As long as you do that, you're golden. There are several different paths you can take including some with lookouts, some that go deep into the valley and some that explore the ups and downs of the preserve. So be sure to do your research and figure out which path you want to take. \n\nHiker be warned!! You know how they also warn you to never leave the beaten path? Well... I didn't listen...and when I didn't listen, a jumping cactus decided to show me how it earned the name \""""jumping cactus\"""" by jumping right onto my ankle. With nothing but water and a lone backpack, we had to improvise ways to get the needles out of my ankle. Now here's a little tid bit of knowledge about the jumping cactus...when it attaches to let's say, you're leg, it hooks in and makes it pretty darn hard to get out. Ten painful prick removals later, I was back on board and a little sore, but kept on truckin'. So be warned and keep a solid eye out for any little cacti lying around, because they are everywhere on Piestewa Peak. But don't let that scare you! It's well worth any scrapes you get along the way!",1

1520,"Where do I start with this place?!?!  We arrived at about 8:20 to a restaurant that closes at 9pm and it was JUMPING!  We were immediately greeted with a friendly hello and seated right away.  The first thing I noticed was an endless amount of people TAKING PICTURES of their food!  Yes I did it too!  You can hear the people at each of the tables saying OMG this is so GOOD!!!  There were still people coming in at 8:55...Did I mention they close at 9pm?  The iced tea was fresh and my glass was never empty!!!  The other thing I noticed right away was the owner walking to EVERY TABLE and not only asking everyone how their meal was but she was right in there with her staff asking if people needed more drinks as well as to go boxes.  She was absolutely amazed by all the people taking pictures and when she asked some of the men behind us about it she said \""""You are posting pictures of my food?\""""  LOL welcome to the world of social media and people who are uploading constantly!  This place was top notch and so was the staff.  I haven't enjoyed a meal like that in a very long time and as a plant eater one of the things I loved most about this place is that essentially everything is vegetarian with the option to add Tofu instead of meat!

1521,"Lyft is a great alternative to driving. When I plan on having a few drinks, I always use Lyft to get there and safely back home again. Their prices are reasonable and all of their drivers are friendly. Some drivers offer free water, candy, phone chargers, and let you change the radio station. I had a driver once who had baked cookies and they were fresh and delish. I had another driver with a free wifi hotspot in his car. They are usually available around the clock and I usually don't have to wait more than 10 minutes for them to arrive. It's a pleasure to ride in a Lyft. I can't say that about any other form of transportation in Phoenix.

We sat outside to enjoy the weather and keep my kids happy. It took almost 15 minutes for a server to even acknowledge me - despite my telling the hostess after 10 minutes, and trying the flag down the server who kept going out of his way to ignore me. Finally I was able to flag down another waitress, and give her our full order, so that it would arrive by the time my friend got off work.\n\nThe lunch rush was over, so I didn't expect our food  to take longer than 15 minutes. We ordered a fruit salad (the Carribean), a Lavosh Chicken Schwarma Wrap, and a kids meal. THIRTY minutes had passed and our food was still not out. My friend literally had 10  minutes to eat before she had to be back in court.\n\nThe only thing they were quick about was taking my friend's credit card.\n\nThe 2 stars was because the food was delicious as usual, but this was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant for lunch. So disappointed.\n\nI really hope they step up their game. Next time I will go back to the Desert Ridge or Arrowhead location. Much better service/experience.",0

When she brought our drinks she then told us that we can only order fried items and no flat breads.  Mind you, they say they are open until 11pm.  If you don't want to cook after 10pm then close at 10pm.  I was pissed!!!  Went to Native Grill but couldn't order anything from the grill.  Just doesn't make sense.  We just left!!!  I do not recommend this place at all!!!",0
1525,Phone cracked last night and needed it repaired ASAP. Recently moved to Vegas and all my friends recommended this place. Walked in and got it fixed within 45 mins. Gave my a screen protector as well. Highly recommend this place! Charged me 76 for iPhone 5 screen replacement. Thanks!,1
1526,"I have been to this location on several occasions and don't know why we keep going back. I guess we keep hoping for a good experience Truthfully, the food is good and the patio is a great place to go hang out and enjoy a Sunday afternoon.  The service on the other hand is horrendous. We had a server but never got to order food because after drinks were dropped, the server never came back. Ever. I wasn't there when the drinks were ordered so I literally never saw our server. Pretty unbelievable. I realize it was busy but seriously,  staff accordingly. That was our last attempt to enjoy ourselves at the Vig..never again.",0
1527,"Slate interiors is like a pandora a box, you never know what you are going to find new and different. A lot my favorite things in my house are from slate. I will say that sometimes the parking can be a little tricky with the other businesses nearby compromising a lot of the parking, but if you get there at the right times, it's okay. Slate can also be good for smaller things like gifts, too. Keep up the good work!",1
1528,"Planet Hollywood is a great hotel in Vegas. It's in the middle of cheap and luxurious. I believe that this hotel provides all the basic essentials you need in Vegas. The rooms are large and accommodating. They let you check in early for $20+ more dollars -- eh not that bad. We needed to get in a bed since we drove so early! The check-in line most recently was the longest thing ever - and it seemed like hardly any of the customer services areas were open...so weird.\n\nThe casino part of this hotel is the best part because they have great food options and an entire mall! The Miracle Mile Shops are something I visit every time I'm in Vegas regardless if I were staying there or not. Earl's Sandwiches is the highlight-- open 24 hours:) The club here is not the best, but they got a whole lotta other things going on worth checking out.",1
1529,I just don't get this place.  All the food comes straight from Cysco and falls into their fryer and onto your table.  The wings are lukewarm.  The service is bad.  The lighting is terrible.  The place looks dirty.  My wife had the fried fish and shrimp.  The shrimp were tiny and obviously from the frozen section of Costco.  So were the fish.  So were the curly fries (but those are damn good anyway),0
1530,"I went to an event where this guy was catering.  Food was standard food-truck cheap tacos on stale, store-bought tortillas.  Of course I got sick the next day really bad as did my wife and kids.  I didn't see any sort of Health Department card at his stand.  Not sure if he's licensed or not.  Never again, Taco Man.  Never again.",0
1531,"I pick up lunch from this location once in a while, since there isn't a whole lot to choose from close to my work. This place is packed from 11am- 1pm. The staff is ok... slow but ok. The one thing I have to comment on is that I hate the new automatic response on the drive through. \n\n\""""Hi, Welcome to McDonald's. Would you like to try our hot chocolate today?\"""" \n\nThen there is a pause... and you get a real person. \n\n\""""Hi, can I take your order?\""""\n\nUm... No I don't want a hot chocolate... it's July! Why would I want a hot chocolate? \n\nOh... and if you place your order at the first drive through order box, and you pull up to the second one, because you're behind someone you'll go through the same ordeal all over again and then you'll have to explain to the lady on the other end that you've already placed your order.\n\nThat's the price you pay for going to McDonalds.. a headache.",0
1532,"The Spice Market buffet was really disappointing.  The shrimp, wild mushroom stew, strawberry cream cake and bread pudding were the only redeeming dishes.  The crab legs had the frozen seawater taste (at least they were pre cut) and most of the fish in the seafood section were dried out, frozen fish.  The grape rolls in the Middle Eastern wasn't even edible.  \n\nThe deserts were marginally better.  It was definitely a cop out to have so many cupcakes instead of real deserts.  Glad I got a groupon and didn't pay full price for it.",0
1533,"Came here for lunch with bottomless champagne for about $30. I was pretty satisfied. This buffet is separated by countries (they actuall have signs that say Asian/Italian/American...etc.). All in all, each type of food is well represented. The chinese food was good, not just your typical Panda Express type. Good pizza. They had Kobe beef sliders!!! Kobe beef! Prime rib was pretty good, tender and pink. Also, the dessert selection is fairly large. The waitress was super nice, loading us up on bubbly as soon as our glasses were empty. Only complaint is that seafood selection could've been better. I would definitely recommend this buffet.",1
1534,"This Hotel doesn't even deserve a 1 star. A motel in Vegas would be a better choice if your looking for an affordable hotel. Motel 6 is cheaper and the rooms are basically the same. Cheap! The old white guy in a yellow shirt they call  The Security Guard was an a-hole. You know, the type of guy who enjoys their plastic badge and takes advantage of power trip that wasn't at all necessary in a situation. And their receptionist was the cherry on top. Hotel staff was the worst. I have never been to a hotel that made me feel so unwanted and unwelcomed. I have been to almost all the hotels in Vegas and Alexis Park Hotel is by far the worst hotel ever.",0
1535,"First things first, The name of this place is Chef Guru G and not Chef Guru. It resembles a hole in the wall. This place doesn't even try to look fancy. I'd heard people raving about their curry poutine, So I wanted to try it out. There were around 6 people in this restaurant  havin the same thing. The CURRY POUTINE. It was spicy and delicious. A perfect amalgamation of  Quebecois & Pakistani cuisine.  So far one of the best poutine variations I've tried in the city. They take a while to prepare it. It gives me hope (or false hope) that they make it fresh.\n\nFood: Great\nService:Friendly / Slow\nAmbiance: Hole in the wall\nWorth the price: Yes",1
1536,"All I wanted is some pie, and she wouldn't give it to me.....\n\nNo, seriously. I was the easiest and best type of customer a business just dreams about. I knew what I wanted, and I all wanted to do is paid for it and leave - simple.\n\nSo I went inside and I grabbed the apple pie and started to look for the pumpkin pie - couldn't find it. I finally located a worker...\""""I am off the clock\"""" he said and walked away. OK. I spotted another....\""""I will be right back\"""" she said and walked off, never to be seen again. I manage to find the pumpkin pie, but it was the behind the display case - the kind that employee reach in to retrieve the pies. I started to look around for help again, no one to be seen. By the way, this was sunday afternoon with several customers inside. I heard some workers in the back room and they saw me, but chose to ignore me. At that point I should have just left, but all I wanted is some damn pie. So I went around the counter, reached in for the pie, grabbed it, took it to the register, paid for it and left.\n\nWHY MAKE BUYING PIE SO DIFFICULT?\n\nAnyway, the pies were good, little pricey but good, not spectacular. Although it got me thinking. With the employees that care so little, how much love did go in to making that pie. Would they care if they dropped some filling on the floor. Would they pick that back up and put it back in the pie. I have never seen that a work ethic this bad. \nI hope that management gets their act together and actually manages their employees.",0
1537,"Arizona Mills has the worst bathrooms I have ever been in. They are always really, really smelly and warm.\n\nI like that there are outlet stores, so you can save a lot of money, but at the same time some of the stores they have are really ghetto and a lot of the outlets have ghetto items.\n\nThe mall is always really packed and there are a ton of kids running around. People walk on the wrong side of the mall, or walk in large groups that prevent people from getting by.\n\nAnd the worst part: there are at least ten different cell phone kiosks and you get badgered every time you walk by. They wont leave you alone. They also have two or three of those carts that sell lotion. I have had people chase me into stores trying to get me to buy natural sea potions. It's just annoying and always makes my shopping experience uncomfortable.",0
1538,"The staff and owner are tremendously helpful and knowledgeable. Most importantly, the quality of the materials is remarkable, especially for the cost!\n\nI highly recommend to anyone and everyone to have their flooring done through Nulook Floor.  They are absolutely THE BEST in town!",1
1539,"What a waste of time. I was in town, visiting with my sister and wanted to grab a quick snack. So I found a Groupon deal that read $7 for two waffles/crepe. With that said, you would presume that meant what it's stated. $7 for 2 (TWO) Waffles or Crepe. But nope, they take the cost displayed per item, which was about $5 - $6 per waffle/ or crepe. And then ended up ordering a mocha and a bottle of water. The total came out to be $25 (which the cashier subtracted $7), the total being $18. So not only did Groupon charge me $7 but the place charged me $18. I paid a total of $25 for two crepes/waffles and two beverages, which is the original cost. The cashier said he already took the deal into account. SO basically, there is no deal. \n\nIt's really deceptive advertising, and I'm a marketer myself. You don't lie like that. Crepe Shack & Waffles you should be ashamed of yourself!",0
1540,"This place is overpriced and lacking in quality and flavor. Certainly great if in a bind if you are very hungry at 3 am after hanging in the village, but otherwise not worth it. The decor is unauthentic and really it just looks like it's been slapped together.",0
1541,"Yelp says it's closed but I'm pretty sure I was here the other night... It was delicious! Burani bulani lamb curry and lamb couscous all get thumbs up. Though if I were to give an edge to any dish it would be the lamb curry, get it with the soup and dip that pita in it and that, my friends, is a really really solid 13$ dinner.",1
1542,"I came here for lunch with some coworkers. The place is hip and clean. They seemed understaffed BUT like another Yelper stated, \""""the food is worth the wait.\"""" If you go on Tuesdays, it is dollar-off certain tacos.\n\nThe tacos I had were delectable - I will be back!\n\nA solid 5 stars for food and 3 stars for their lack of servers. (We had to wait a while to get our food).",1
1543,"Nope. And it's 100% because of the service. There's maybe 12 tables in the place, yet we were somehow invisible. A glass with one melting ice cube sat in front of me for 10 minutes before the kid remembered to open the cooler and bring me my can of soda. The food was just okay - the pork was a generous serving but overcooked. Perhaps that's why it took so long (20 min), even though no other dishes were coming out of the kitchen. I had to ask for silverware twice, and no water refills.\nThe kicker was at the end. I wanted to buy 4 pastries and the server acknowledged. 10 minutes later, a dude walks in and buys all the pastries in one go. When I (finally) got the check and asked about the pastries, she says \""""Sorry, we're sold out.\"""" W...T...F.\nIf you have nowhere to be for a few hours, angelic levels of patience and aren't concerned with flavor, this might be a place to check out.\nTwo stars because the order was accurate and I believe the kitchen is doing their best.",0
1544,Beautiful set up.  Small condo type rooms with a small stove and clothes washer / dryer.  If I was in town for a few days this place would be perfect.  Rooms are nice and new.  The lady who checked me in was very nice and helpful (Emily).  Only bummer was that I could hear the guy in the room next to me on the phone.,1
1545,"The store ladies were helpful but this store is a huge waste of time. They did not have most of the styles. If you ask for a peeptoe, they will have it but not in patent, if they have it in patent, they won't have your size. All of the current season styles are not carried in the store either; even if they do, you guessed, it! No size!!\nIt was quite disturbing because they didn't even carry some of the most basic styles and sizes. Some of the other customers in the store had the same problem too.\nI would probably just skip this store and walk on over to Neiman's or Barney's for a better selection.",0
1546,"Five stars if my second visit is as good as the first.  I had a few minutes to kill in the afternoon, so just went in to have a look around because I've heard good things.  Even though there wasn't much left in the pastry counter, what was there was amazing.  AMAZING!  The pastries were all so beautiful they almost didn't look real.  Some of the chocolate even was finished with this metallic substance that made them look just like copper.  The girl behind the counter was so nice and patiently answered all the stupid questions falling from my drool covered face.  So of course I had to try a mousse, and may I say AMAZING!  Best mousse I've had in years.  There were obviously no shortcuts in ingredients or preparation.  Can't wait to go back and try more!",1

I stayed here last year and it took me an hour and a half to check in at what they like to call the VIP check in.  Believing it was an isolated instance, I came back this year. I reserved an $800 suite four months ago and it is now 5:00 pm and the room is still not ready. The staff and manager offer no accommodations or apologies and their attitude is that if I don't like paying for a room that I don't get to use, I should stay somewhere else. I assured them that I would on all future stays.",0

1549,"Great ambience. I boyfriend brought me here for my birthday dinner. Just him and I. We started off with the soup on of the day which was a pur\u00e9ed asparagus type with shrimp on the bottom. It was delicious.\n\nFor entree, bf ordered the lamb chops. He's a steak guy but has had it before here and the waiter talked him into trying something new and went on about how great they were. I would say the waiter was right because I didn't hear one complaint. He said they were great.\nI ordered the scallop entree, it also comes with shrimp and all lays on a bed of filling risotto. It all was amazing and very filling.\nFor sides we got the gnocchi-we just aren't truffle lovers.. But if you are this dish is for you! Creamed corn- which was GREAT. Bf mentioned how great it was a few different times throughout the meal:) and also the broccoli gratin... It was also good. \nI ordered a birthday martini because I saw it on Pinterest and it wasn't very good at all. \n----------\nBUT after writing this review the GM Yassien:) came over merely 5 minutes after and apologized for the mediocre martini and replaced it with my favorite, the dirty martini.

1550,"I'm from Hawaii, where eating Japanese cuisine is part of my everyday. Truthfully, I wasn't sure if I wanted to go to a Japanese restaurant while on a vacation, but the boyfriend wanted to...and I owed him for so willingly accompanying me to the Celine Dion concert. \n\nHyakumi was an unexpected delight. We easily made reservations in the morning and ate dinner at around 6.  \n\nThe service was attentive but it was the food that left me satisfied. We split a hibachi order with sushi on the side. The meat was flavored simply and was very tender - though overcooked for our order of medium rare. I hate meat that is flavored so much that you can't taste that you are eating beef.\n\nThe sushi was among the best I've ever had. The ahi (tuna) went down so smoothly that I had to eat several more pieces to confirm that I was eating such heavenly food. \n\nOverall, I'd go again.",1
1551,"THEY MADE QUACKING-TALK TO MUCH HAND GESTURES TO MY FACE!\n   \nI took my cashmere wool blend coat to Celebrity Drycleaners.  Because of the cashmere blend, I specifically asked for a quote on the item.  The quote was reasonable, upon my return to pick up the coat I was charged double what I was quoted.    I was told there was no way they quoted me that price and they called me a liar.\n  \nIt was so rude, the other customers in the store started to argue for me (thank goodness for good people sticking up for each other).\n  \nWhen I continued to try and get the quoted price, the counter person made the gesture with her hands, like a duck quacking (the gesture you make when someone is talking too much).   Wow!  I called her out on that!   It was so rude.  \n\nWhen I asked to talk to the owner, the lady suddenly didn't understand english.  Then, after finally understanding the word \""""owner\"""" said she was the owner.  What a joke!\n  \nI filed a compliant with the Better Business Bureau. Celebrity Cleaners refused to respond to BBB letters.  I've used this service for my husbands business shirts and pressing services on and off for more than 10 years.  I'd be crazy to give them any more business.",0
1552,"General feel:  This location is great.  It is relatively new and offers a fast drive-thru and sparkling new interior.  Same affordable and quality tasting meals that makes me love the Panda Express brand.\n\nCustomer service:  Two employees I've noticed, Susana - she is extremely welcoming and genuine, it is always nice to see her,  and Nancy - I appreciate her efficiency at taking orders and serving guests, on busy days she keeps the line moving fast.  \nThere is one girl I will remain nameless, let's call her Lipstick, is a bit.... how to put it... it seems as every day is her first day on the job.  Which is a bit frustrating when you see her every time.\n\nTip:  Fill out the easy survey (online or by phone) on the back of your receipt and receive a free entree with your next purchase of a two-entree plate.  I love giving positive feedback!  It's easy for people to criticize, I like to recognize whats good:)",1
1553,"This place seems pretty popular but I'm not feeling it.  If you really have a craving  for local food then maybe you might go here, but really the food is kind of lousy.  Big portions, but no good flavor.  My katsu was kind of soggy, mac salad is weak and tasted of garlic powder, manapua is like the kind you get in the frozen food section at 99 Ranch, kalbi is average, grilled salmon is ok but the Teri sauce is cloying sweet.  I can cook most items bettah myself.  Depends how hungry you are, but the girl at the counter was cool.  And they have no hot mustard for the saimin and wonton min.  There's a big flat screen tv in there though.",0
1554,"For a new hotel I was surprised with the lack of quality with this place. It seemed like they cut a lot of corners when making this place. First, there was no line when I walked in. I don't know if they are trying something new at this place or what but the concept does not work. You have a melee of people trying to get a spot and no one to really guide what's going on. My buddy who was also staying there ended up waiting 40 minutes when his key didnt work and he had to get a new one. Terrible service. \n\nOnce up to the room, you get surprised with the automatic blinds and a great looking room but that's where things end. My bed was collapsed on one end...how does this happen in a new hotel and how do they not replace it? The walls were paper thin. I could hear everyone's conversations! It didnt matter if there were yelling or talking at a normal level...I could hear it. \n\nOut of the room things were no better. Try to eat in the hotel and you will pay top dollar for average food. The buffet will charge you extra for their weekend brunch when its simply no more than left overs from the week prior (trust me I ate there about 3 or 4 times and the items were starting to get old). They did have some interesting things on the menu such as goat but it hardly justified the price. I also went for a burger in the main cafe type restaurant and ended up having to pay extra for every addition on top of the bun and meat. I think I ended up with a $25 burger that I could have gotten at Burger King for less than $5....my total meal with drink and salad came out to over $40!. \n\nThe hotel bars were ok but became over crowded as there isnt much to do here and you're always looking to go else where. I also don't like over whelming smells and the air fragrance they pump into the hotel is absolutely obnoxious. I could actually smell people at my convention who had been staying at the Aria because you could smell that horrible fragrance. \n\nNever again will I stay here.",0
1555,"We visited Le Village early on a Thursday night and were not sure what to expect based on the varying Yelp reviews. However, I must say that both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised. \n\nThe wait was nearly nonexistent (it was early Thursday after all), and we were seated within five minutes despite having no reservation. Our server was friendly, but was clearly having to man a lot of duties, as it was a good 10 minutes between each visit. \n\nBut of course any buffet lives and dies on the food, and the fare here ranges from average to surprisingly good. The highlights were the fantastic crepe station (\""""Le Singe\"""", a banana and hazelnut crepe, was excellent), the flan, which was some of the best I've had buffet or otherwise, and the seafood offerings like bouillabaisse and arrabiata mussels. The other entries were all passable to good, and I cleared all three plates. \n\nThe price might be a touch high, especially with the Bellagio across the street for a few dollars more, but I actually preferred this buffet to the Wynn which we are in the same week. It's a quaint French countryside take on the Vegas buffet and a fair choice for your bachanalian endulgence.",1
1556,"I went there on a Friday night and it was a very casual, laid-back environment.  The waiter told us to just pick any table we wanted, and didn't mind when we sat at a table meant for 8 since it was the only one open.  They recommended a lovely malbec to go with our meal that I wish didn't come out warm.  We ordered:\nA pork belly appetizer that I was excited to try but it ended up coming out as an empanada with the pork belly shredded and pulverized.   Travesty.\nCharcuterie plate - the cheese was good, but the meat came out shredded into little pieces.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but just weird.  \nRomaine wedge salad - nothing special but it was good \nCrab gnocchi - HORRIBLE.  I've never had such bad gnocchi before.  I don't know what they did to that potato but it was tasteless and had the consistency of clay.  \nI would not recommend it to anybody.",0
1557,"This is one of the top 5 hotel/casinos, facility-wise, in Vegas (IMHO). The building is beautifully appointed and well tended to. That said, the service levels have been suspect on many of my adventures here, however, that was not the case on my most recent trip. I had great encounters with the front desk personnel and my favorite new bartender on the strip (pro tip- go see Wendy. She'll get you very pleasantly drunk).\n\nWHEN YOU GO- all the rooms are suites but not all suites are created equal. For a mild upgrade fee ($40 a day) I went from their standard 550-ish sq foot rooms to an 1,100 sq footer with amazing pool views and a bathroom bigger than most strip rooms. If you'll be hanging at the pool, and I recommend you do, be aware that in the fall months the sun shifts drastically and quickly. Your killer spot that you staked out at 10:30am could easily be in the dark by 1pm. Ask the friendly pool staff where the spotz are. And don't forget to tip for that intel!",1
1558,"I really love this little business.  They are true to what real Mexican Paletas are supposed to be - fresh fruit ingredients, no preservatives, all natural with no fake flavors or fake colors to account for cheap ingredients.\n\nI wish the owners the best with this business because I think they are approaching Paletas the way I would - upscale target audience (ie. they are not.99c paletas like at the grocery store) that appreciate the work and ingenuity they bring to the flavors and combinations of their paletas\n\nThis evening, we tried the Cereze (cherries *baptized* and wading in brandy, then mixed with home-made roasted almond milk) and the Zarzamora (blackberries with a hint of lavender) - my sister and I were both on cloud 9 with the flavorings (she liked my Cereza waaay more.... I found hers was equally awesome).  Their price point is 3ish, depending on what the ingredients are.\n\nI will keep being a fan and loyal here, as long as they keep to their clean, natural, creative ingredients.",1
1559,"I like Chinese food.  Americanized or authentic, from the streets of Wuhan or a plaza in Monroeville, I have enjoyed it.  In light of that, China Palace on Walnut Street is... well... kind of okay.\n\nThe positives: \n\nThe vegetarian menu has an especially good selection.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I usually order from that menu just because it's something different.  The food isn't terrible, either, but it's not great.  It's also usually easy to get a table (last time I went there, I tried to go to Pamela's first, but it was a Saturday afternoon, so there was no hope of getting in.)  Oh, and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all.\n\nThe negatives:\n\nDim lighting that makes me want to sleep.  It's not romantic, just dim.\n\nThe only waitress I've had there is pretty rude.  She's just not cut out for waiting tables, or interacting with people in general.  My minimum tip is $5, even at the cheapest places.  She got $1.60, because she didn't do the minimum amount of customer service I require to give my minimum tip.\n\nThe food is only okay.  \n\nAll in all, if you're on Walnut and you can avoid China Palace, try something else.  You won't HATE your experience here, but it won't be memorable, either.  I will probably return, though, for the cheap lunch specials, but that's because I'm moving out of country soon and I need to save every penny I can, not because I really love the place.",0

1564,"SAD! So much potential, but missed it completely. Many times, when I first drive up to a place and I see 3 or more of the staff outside the back door smoking cigarettes I will hop back in my car and leave, but this place had really good write ups and we were in the mood for some super Italian food after working all day so we decided to give it a try anyway. We were readily greeted and seated, and water was brought to the table in no time at all. We had a few minutes to look over the menu. My husband and I decided we would each get a salad and then share an entree of linguine with clam sauce. I ordered the mixed green salad which was supposed to have greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and olives. I kid you not, there was only about one fourth of ONE olive on my whole salad and there was no onion whatsoever. There were greens, tomatoes and three half slices of cucumber with a tasty balsamic dressing for $8. What it should have cost was $4 at the most. My husband ordered the arugula salad topped with Gorgonzola cheese. The arugula greens were nice and fresh and the he enjoyed the balsamic dressing as well BUT his salad only had a minuscule amount of Gorgonzola on it ( three small pieces to be exact) $9  I must give credit where credit is due, their bread was really quite good. It was a flat bread that seemed freshly baked right out of their wood fired oven and then lightly brushed with olive oil and dusted with black pepper. Then linguine comes out. First thing I notice is there is no spoon served with the pasta dish. Well, I figured out real soon why there was no spoon because there was NO SAUCE (unless a tablespoon of sauce counts) also, about one third of the clam shells that were served with the pasta were void of any clams. One of the clams was still shut too. So, the tablespoon of sauce we did get was tasty, but really...how hard is it to add a bit of garlic, butter and white wine and put it on the pasta....there was no sauce! The whole meal was so sad because components of it were so good but then it was so messed up by the huge oversights. The homemade pasta noodles had delightful flavor yet so very very dry. I wanted to try the tiramisu for desert but by this point I knew what to expect so we passed. So very very sad. Bummer! It seemed like a restaurant that was skimping on everything because they were struggling not to go out of business. I would not return.",0

She gave me a great cut and actually listened to what I wanted, yay! My hair looks great and I will definitely be returning.",1
1567,"This restaurant is next to the hotel where I was staying.

I don't know what the heck went wrong but it had a horrible \""""off\"""" taste and I couldn't eat it.  If I hadn't already changed into my comfy clothes kicked back ready to eat, chill and watch tv, I would have taken back the Spaghetti in it's entirety. Dang, it was BAD!  The salad was good, so that was my dinner.  I would NOT go back here.   Minus Stars for the Veggie Spaghetti, 2 starts for the Salad.",0

The frustrating part is that I phoned first and asked if they service phones - Next.\n\nWent to find an AT & T Store... Found the store and signed in and was eighth on the list. While waiting I noticed (overheard) that each customer was told \""""you need a new phone.\""""  My turn, I describe my issue and ask for a battery. \""""You need a new phone,\"""" I'm told. I reply, \""""This is a work phone, I am on call tomorrow, I need a battery.\"""" This continues for awhile and I find out if they have any batteries \""""yes.\""""  Then I talk the clerk into putting it in my phone.

1569,First time here was good and the food was great. the pho was done well and the broth was great as well the only reason for the 4 stars is the Customer service. they had a great attitude but i had to get up to ask for a check and a to go cup. It would have been better to order and pay up front and seat ourselves so we know that we have to get up to get to go cups and Drinks etc... because there was 1 person working the register and tending to everything so it takes away from the customer service of a sit down restaurant. but thats my opinion i will go back for sure and will tell others to go there.,1

1571,"This little strip mall Indian restaurant gets a bonus point for being so beautiful inside.  Very contemporary with traditional flair.  It gets minus one point beacuse it was hot.  Was thA/C broken or was the food's spicey nature taking advantage of me?  It was slightly unpleasant but I will get over it.  The Guru Palace get's 3 solid stars on it's very friendly helpful service and it's wonderful food.  I have only dined here twice and it was consitantly good.\nThis time from the $8.99 buffett I tried the Palaak Paneer which is excellent. I of course had a piece of the Tandoori Chicken (thigh piece, I think.  I have a thing for meat on the bone-don't care for it.  That's  why I prefer Chicken Tikka.)  It was good but not as good as the Chicken Marsala.  Pungent and very flavorful. The rice was a differnt form today-not basmati which I prefer.  There was a new dish I did not recognize called Mushroom Matar (?).  It was delicious with bits of onion and peas in a tangy light gravy of sort.  I also enjoy the garlic naan.  No papdum was offerred this time.  I did enjoy a split of champagne which compliments the delightful spicey flavors without filling you up.\nI was so warm from the lack of a/c and hot spicy achaar chutney (my favorite) that I was melting like the wicked witch at my table. \nThe service was very friendly and I don't know how anyone could call this expensive.  I thought it was downright cheap!  $3.99 for champagne plus two full plates of great food.  It is a great place to stop in for reliable food, kind staff and beutiful dining room.",1

We let our waitress know, Aubrey was her name, that we wanted the appetizer first.\n15 minutes roll around and no appetizer! Plus my husband was out of water and she hadn't come around. Finally a different waitress comes out with our order, minus the appetizer.  I mention to her we haven't received it and our waitress shows up just in time to hear this and basically scolds the other waitress helping out, like it was her fault that we didn't get our appetizer.  So we ask for a refill as she leaves, no problem, or at least we thought, 5 minutes into eating their suicide wings (which are by far the hottest hot wings I have ever tasted) my husband is really in need of that water. Finally I see her come around but with no water, she almost makes it to the table when I see that she realizes the same thing and she does a complete 180, and a few minutes later...daa daa!!! Water!!!  Other than the service completely lacking, and the pizza pretty blah, I enjoyed the wings and zucchini.  Unfortunately it did kinda ruin that satisfaction I was going for since after all I was really craving something more than what I got.",0

I don't get why they keep doing this, how they can afford to buy so much furniture, and what the reason for it is. The place is also kept a little too dark for what its trying to be.\n\nThe menu used to be pretty large, but is pretty overpriced for what they offer and for the place. They cut the menu down to a page or two a few weeks ago, but it is still overpriced.",0
1577,Pay the extra for the VIP seats. We sat in the fourth row and had that up close experience. You also get the programs for free with the VIP. The drinks are expensive but good and they come in a P&T cup. The show is not for those wanting cheap and cheesy Las Vegas magic. The show is intelligent with a touch of politics and social commentary added in. Getting photos and autographs after is amazing.,1
1578,I really did not like this resturant. I went in the summer and they did not have an A/C. Most of their food is spicy so you will sweat like a pig. The food was not tasty at all. I have been to a lot of chinese resturants and this one is certanliy the worst. The soup smelled like a raw chicken which was  so discusting. Sorry but thisbis the truth.,0

1580,"***The actual ADFT course itself does not even account for half of my nightmarish experience. My review isn't the shortest, but it certainly is descriptive and accurate. I can only hope you read it in it's entirety. I was BLACKMAILED and verbally and emotionally ABUSED by NUTJOB Rick Barkett and ADFT. This poor excuse of a professional is abusive, and belittling to say the least and needs to be exposed.***\n--------------------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------------\nIN THE CLASSROOM...\nIn Feb 2013, I attended a concealed carriers permit course with instructor Rick Barkett. \nDuring the sit down portion of the course he ran an informative Power Point. Blazing through each slide at a rate of about 10 seconds; he chose his \""""favorites\"""" in the class as well as the ones he would treat like COMPLETE SKUM. There was an older gentleman in the course who had a lot of questions throughout the Power Point. Big deal, we're here to learn, right?  \nEvery question this older man asked was answered in a condescending, \""""I don't have time for you\"""" kind of way. \nI was also on his crap list. Simply because I asked him a few times if he could go slower while shuffling through the Power Point slides.\n--------------------------------------------------\u00ad-----------\nOUT AT THE RANGE...\nBy the time it was my turn to practice at the target I was shaking with nervousness from witnessing the way the attendees before me were treated by Rick. Anyone that made a mistake was literally DOWNGRADED, YELLED AT and DAUNTED for it. Rick even went as far as lifting up one gentleman's ear muff and SCREAMING, literally screaming into his ear.\nI came equipped with my own gun and am very experienced with it. But each time I went to cock my 45, a bullet would get jammed in the barrel due to Rick's rampaging. \nI asked him twice if he could assist me with the jam but he just huffed at me and stormed away. The third time it happened, I just sat there because I was too PETRIFIED to do anything else.\n------------------------------------\nBACK IN THE CLASSROOM...\nIt was the end of the class and Rick was passing out certificates of completion. Upon finding mine, he simply walked up to my table, CALLED ME PATHETIC tossed it on my table in front of the whole class.\nThere were about 4 attendees that went up to me after the dismissal of the class and tried to console me and ended up exchanging contact information.\n--------------------------------------------------\u00ad---------------------------\nTHE NEXT MORNING...\nI called ADFT to complain. (That was my first mistake because Rick OWNS ADFT!!!) I told the gentleman over the phone I was unhappy with the treatment I received from Rick. The gentle man said \""""NO, Rick would never do that.\"""" I responded by saying I had two witnesses from the class to verify my claim. I then gave him their information. \nThe man on the phone proceeded to say that if I was \""""unhappy with the course instruction\"""" that he had no other choice than to revoke my certificate. I explained that it wasn't the education I was  unhappy with but rather THE WAY THE INSTRUCTOR TREATED ME. But there was no reasoning with him.\nThen I received a call from Rick stating that he was issuing a refund and indeed revoking my certificate. \nNot even an hour later I received calls from my witnesses saying that they couldn't speak out against Rick because he threatened taking their certificates away if they did.\nBLACKMAIL. BLACKMAIL. BLACKMAIL.\n-----------------------------------------------\nThe next day I filed a complaint with the BBB in attempt to keep my certificate.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2 MONTHS LATER!!!\nRick told BBB that he would reinstate my certificate if I DENIED ANYTHING AT ADFT EVER HAPPENED.\n(I filed with BBB for some closure. So of course I didn't deny anything.) I was then issued a refund by ADFT because I didn't comply with Rick's subhuman request. It was all a very a long  and hurtful ordeal for me and was baffled at what had happened.\n\nRick Barkett SUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS.",0

You can get your tacos customized to your tastes and watch them make it in front of you. Props for the open kitchen! I had the cabeza, carne asada and al pastor. My friend got the buche and carne asada \""""gran taco\"""" style, which means it comes stuffed with cheese, beans, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream and salsa in addition to the meat. I liked the cabeza the best, soft and with the right amount of spice.\n\nThere was only one cashier at the time I went, and she was busy cleaning tables for ~10 minutes, so my tacos were getting cold unfortunately. But they still tasted good! I really liked the condiment bar once you get into the dining area. So many salsas! And they had beans!",1
1583,"When we go to Vegas we now stay at the Wynn properties, Encore or Wynn.   These hotels are TOP shelf.  They are beautiful and quiet and they rarely have families or children there.  The casinos are large and open and lovely.  \nThe rooms are large and beautiful and the hotel staff is amazing.  From the front desk to the concierge to the cleaning people, exceptional. \nFrom the second you check in they call you by your name, and when you need something at the room they are on it. \nI like that the hotels are at the other end of the strip from places like the MGM which has gone so far down hill and hosts so many children than I can barely stand to go there anymore, even to the casino. \nThe casions at Wynn and Encore have such a great filtration system that you never smell the smoke at all.\nThey have great restaurants, great booze, wine and weight staff including the cocktail waitresses. \nI agree with some of the other reviews that they could use a few more tables for gambling, like Pai Gow, but I think as they become more popular and the economy rises they will do this. \nThe other thing we dont like is the resort fee and that the resort fee does not include using some of the facilities like the weight room and the spa area.  To me if I pay the resort fee than it should give me the priveledge of these areas.  Otherwise you should either up the price of the room or end the resort fee all together, its just obnoxious. \nIts nice that they comped us our meals because we spent so much time at the tables gambling and they were super nice about it all.  \nSo all in all we always have a great experience at these two hotels.  It can be pricey if you go at high times but sometimes you can get some pretty good deals.  \nI highly recommend staying in these two resorts.",1
1584,"My husband and I were looking for a nice (3 star) hotel to stay at while visiting The Valley... when we pulled up we both looked at each other worried, because it (Hotel 502) looked like a converted insane asylum. There was a big banner on the side of the building saying: Newly renovated. So, we were like, \""""Okay, don't judge a book by its cover... the last thing they would finish would be the outside\"""". Inside the lobby was okay-- they tried to make it look modern, so we were hopeful. They charged us a 'resort' fee-- again, we were just wanting to get into our room so we didn't really think twice of it. The elevators were scary-- paintings drilled into the walls, super slow, etc... The hallways smelt like burnt rubber. We entered the room and it was terrible! Nothing like the pictures advertised! I was so upset (my husband and I just got married last weekend, but our wedding night was cut short because he is in the Military and had to get back to TX... so we were hoping this weekend would make up for it)! The carpet was torn up. There was scuffs all over the walls. They had shifted the wall light fixtures over, but they didn't even try and cover up their mess. The mattress was on just a bed frame (no bed skirt even hiding the mattress). The T.V. was a tube. There was yellow stains in the bathtub. It was horrid! My husband talked to the front desk and they explained that the pictures that were advertised were their deluxe rooms and we paid for a standard. Luckily, he said he'd refund us our money if Expedia gave us the OK (which they did and booked at a much nicer place). We grabbed our stuff and left as fast as we could. Did I mention that there was a half filled used water bottle just chilling on the desk? If they just leave used things laying around imagine what else they didn't clean. Gross. Gross. Gross!",0
1585,"This has definitely become one of my favorite go to places while at work in downtown Phoenix.  Whether I just need some morning caffeine or I need an excuse to get out of the office - it's off to Cartel and it's not hard to find someone to tag along. I used to be a Starbucks Junkie, but have officially become addicted to Cartel.  I can have a Toddy (their iced coffee) anytime of the day, in any weather...even if it's freezing outside.  The best part, I can go back in the afternoon and get another delicious toddy, no charge.\n\nThe coffee isn't the only thing that keeps me coming back.  Their homemade pastries are to die for.  Initially I was hooked on the Bacon Chocolate Chip cookies made fresh generally on Friday mornings (what a great way to end your work week).  More recently, I went back in the afternoon for their 'Happy Hour' specifically for pastries.  I tried one of their Bacon Cheddar Scones.  Oh my, I shouldn't have gone there - more afternoon trips to come.  It was delicious and made a perfect accompaniment with a good hot soup too!  I ate it with dinner, but I'm sure it would be just as good for breakfast.\n\nCan't wait to continue to experience all that Cartel has to offer...I just hope I can get a Cartel cup soon.

Every year, the prices steadily rise for less services rendered.\n\nYou'd think the last few years they'd change their game with the coming out of competition for Internet and TV but as a soulless corporate giant, they will not change until they truly have to. I'm not talking about their brother company Videotron that barely tries to compete with Bell and maintain a strong oligopoly going but newer services like TechSavvy and Netflix that provide soooo much more for much less.\n\nRecently, I wanted to upgrade to Fibe... did I know it would be such an unwanted challenge? Is it available in my area? Yes. Great, start the process to upgrade, need a new PVR... alright. I bought my old one, which I cannot sell off to someone else...

This is the first time I ever met Bale.  I normally get served by Sarah & Jenn (who are the best & I like dearly).  \n\nThis night, Sarah served my first beer.  When Sarah went on break my beer was empty and I set my glass on the edge of the bar so the bartender knows I am ready for another.  Keep in mind, I am by myself at the end of the bar.  I see her look at my glass and walk away at least two times to serve others at the other end of the bar.  The third time I wave her down and she doesn't even give me a \""""I'm sorry I will be right with you\"""" (recognition of some sort).  So I do something I never done before and that is poor my own beer.  Now, I got her attention! After explaining to her why I did what I did (the fact that she was deliberately ignoring me), Sarah comes back from her break, and I explain what happened.  Sarah knows me and was very nice about her reasons of having to kick me out.  It is illegal to pour your own beer, now I admit, I was not thinking about that at the time, yet I am glad that happened just to prove a point.  It took me doing something like that to get Bale's attention, what does that say about a person like that.\n\nIn conclusion, I was told I can come back another night, but because of my action Sarah had to ask me to leave, I want to note that Sarah has always given me great service.  However, because of one person, Bale, I will not be coming back to this bar.  I have more class than that, to let someone treat me like I am nothing, when I am a consistent customer.  The sad thing about Bale, it is people like her that leave me hopeless in seeing this local economy thrive again.  I moved back to this neighborhood to support this area, yet people like her have made me decide to move back close to my job in downtown Phoenix  Everyone has to understand, I grew up in this area.  If you're a native like me, you'll understand, if not, you probably will not care.  The bottom line is thanks to the internet consumers like me have a voice.

1597,"2.5 stars. I loved the decor, the steak and company was awesome, but oh the service. As we looked over the menu, I picked up their dining club brochure on a whim. The server took it upon himself to start explaining everything from one end to other without taking a breath. Not a great way to start off. When he finally left, we looked at each other with eyebrows raised.  After we had a chance to look over the menu, he came back and before we even ordered, again asked us if we wanted to join and repeated the 'benefits'. Commission, no? Simply put, it got annoying. \n\nAnyways, on to the menu. We decided to share an appetizer of three jumbo shrimp sauteed in dijon sauce. It was good, but could have been presented better on a small platter, not a large flat dish with literally three split shrimp rolling around. lol\n\nThe side of wild mushrooms was sauteed and delicious. The string beans had the option of sauteed in garlic or steamed; we got it steamed and we agreed they were a bit tough and possibly undercooked. \n\nOk, the filet mignon 9 oz. medium rare - sooo good. Cooked to perfection. The salmon was HUGE....neither of us could finish it. May have something to do with the taste, too - even though it was topped with butter, the fish itself was a little \""""bland,\"""" as my friend stated (his words, not mine!). \n\nAfter our plates were cleared and as I was leaning forward saying something, our server inserted a small-desk-sized platter of six desserts on the table and asked us which one we wanted. I remember a feeling of wow, a bit rude and I just lost my train of thought. Plus, he didn't even ask if we had room for dessert. Well, we didn't. \n\nNow I come on to yelp and find out they had restaurant week this whole time. The server didn't even mention this, even though my dish was on the special menu. Grrrr....",0
1598,Omg wonderful service and food! The vegetarian paella is the best I have ever had! Great venue for vegetarians and non vegetarians. Loved the drink menu as well. THe service is really good and I love the bell and yelling of paella every time they cook a big batch of paella. So festive. The decor is nice also. From the outside it doesn't look like much but the inside once you sit down is cute and modern. definitely will go back!,1
1599,"Had my first visit to the Saucer a few weeks ago for a Trivia night. Beer selection is awesome and you'll find the prices reasonable too! Menu is great and this Cheesehead was very happy to see all the Brat menu items, including the Brat Nachos I started with! Had the chicken cheesesteak for me meal and it was pretty good, though the meat to bread ratio favored the bread.\n\nAs for Trivia - they run a tight ship and it's a blast! The MC is really good and calls out all potential cheaters. Love it! I'll be back again soon when I'm in the University Area.",1
1600,"The same thing that happened to the last guy who wrote a review, happened to me.  They quoted me a $49 fee, charged me $55 just to show up and then another $65 to unlock the door!  Totally lame, I should have done my homework first like I normally do.",0
1601,"I just stayed here while the hotel was in transition from Aladdin to Planet Hollywood-- at the time, the sign read Planet Ho. \n\nThe planet hollywood concept is very promising-- I mean, I don't give a rat's ass about the hollywood tie in, but it's more like they're building a hotel/casino with the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino vibe actually ON THE STRIP. I also had very good luck there and left Vegas a winner for the first time in a long time... Thanks for that guys-- free vacation, np. \n\nNice rooms, low prices, friendly dealers, free of that old school gambler vibe. Overall, nice.",1
1602,"The staff is welcoming and knowledgeable at this decent-sized whisky shop north of the main drag from the Castle.  As you'd expect, they have a large selection of whiskies in bottles of various sizes.  The reason I'm only giving this two stars is that I discovered they are also the most expensive whisky shop in the area by far -- at least of the five I wandered into, including four that are actually on the Royal Mile (where I expected prices to be highest).  A full-size bottle averaged 7-10 pounds higher here than elsewhere; it was just disappointing to discover.",0
1603,"Went to Saddle Ranch with friends for the first time a month or so ago... That visit was fun. Server was pleasant, we got our food & drinks quickly, everything was great for the price. Something huge must have happened between then and yesterday. Place was a wasteland, but we had to wait for a table. Took forever to get our first round of drinks because the \""""bar was backed up\"""" with the dozen other people in the building (they did apologize for that, and comped our next round, that was nice). Food was cooked wrong, the menu included items they don't even have, and we kinda wanted another round when the server brought our bill out. Then the bill was all jumbled up. My food was on one tab, my drinks on another. Plastic drinking cups were cracked and dirty. The girls want to give it another try, but I'm pretty sure I'm done with Saddle Ranch.",0
1604,"When it comes to cars, I am a bit of a snob particularly with regards to maintenance and car. There's a slew of dealerships and shops so what always sells me is customer service and attention to detail. I took my car in for just a check-up and cannot tell you how phenomenal my experience was. I wouldn't think of going anywhere else and trust me, I drove the distance for this service. From the friendly lot attendant at the early hours of the morning to the jovial service adviser, I think their love for cars shows in their attitude and care of the customer. Greg and Phon went above and beyond; this is what customer delighting is about and others should take note. And while they tried to tempt me with a Q50 loaner, I would have just returned as a happy customer. I am a big fan!",1
1605,"Went on a Friday night (the online reservation system was very useful) and had the Olive appetizer (which was worth the 5 dollars just for the amazing homemade sourdough bread that comes with it), the spicy chicken and the whitefish. Everything is carefully thought out, balanced, and with excellent quality ingredients (same goes for the cocktails - we had the sazerac and rhubarb3). Would definitely be interested in going again in the winter and seeing how their menu changes with the season.",1
1606,"The reason I am giving Sweet Tomatoes two stars is because of the salads and soups. I would go to one star if it was based on service and the other items they serve alone. The salad bar has a good selection of toppings and dressings. But they should get rid of the premium toppings. The items you get for another $2.50 and are just not worth it. I also do not see why we have to pay extra for drinks. With the cost of a beverage added it brings the cost above that of other buffets in town. Other pretty good buffets. If it weren't for the salad and soups I would not go at all. The soup is always pretty good and I just love the chili. It does not seem to be consistent, but always good.\n\nThis last visit the line we ware in was just stopped. We stood in line for over ten minutes while the other line was processed and seated. People that came in long after my wife and I were seated well before we were. It seems there was a large party at the front of our line and they had them stand there waiting to be seated. When we got to the front of the line we asked to talk to a manager and the lady behind the counter said she was one and how could she help. We explained what had happened and she said she could not do anything about it and we needed to speak to the people doing the seating. Excuse me! A manager has no control over how the staff is working? That does not seem right. Once we were seated we did talk to someone who was a manager and she was very thoughtful. She even gave us coupons for a free visit.\n\nAnother thing I do not understand is there fresh fruit bar. It consisted of whole apples, grapes and oranges. The other items were chocolate pudding, jello, and another pudding I could not identify. Fresh fruit? I don't think so.",0
1607,A great place in a surprising location. The food was beyond what you'd expect from many other inexpensive Mexican restaurants and far above its food court setting. Excellent selection of menu items familiar and different. Great service and tables inside the store front.  Give it a shot.,1
1608,"I've been waiting for a place like this to open off the strip. Crepe Expectations exceeded my expectations with their friendly staff and their variety of crepe offerings. You can choose from breakfast, savory to sweet crepes and in addition beer, wine or a number of different mimosas. The crepes were very authentic and presentation was nice. My only knock is the dark interior but the last time I checked, I'm not an interior designer and this all about the food and service which were both fantastic. It was very clean and modern inside and they even had a tv showing your crepes being made. The other great thing was that they served Illy Coffee and free refills, thats pretty awesome. Anna and the rest of the staff were super friendly and constantly checked up on us, I will definitely be a regular at this spot!\nIn regards to the food, my wife and I shared one of each of the breakfast, savory and sweet. The crepes were thin, light and held up very well with the fresh fillings...so good!",1
1609,"Even though the situation was less then favorable, Chase went above and beyond to help make the situation amazing for us!!!! So sweet, and understanding he truly made this not favorable time great! As an employer you should feel blessed to have such a hardworking, passionate, customer service driven young man!!",1
1610,"My husband and I went in to see if I can get the clasp on my bracelet fixed. We were immediately greeted by an employee. While she was looking up to see when it was purchased, another employee walked by us, giving us rude looks and whispers something to the employee helping us. She continued to whisper to the women helping us, smirking at us the entire time. My husband was just at there a couple days before to buy my Christmas presents and spent almost $1000. We have never had a rude experience like this at the location we normally go to. \n\nAlso- four weeks to get the clasp fixed on my bracelet. That doesn't sound right. We will take our business back to the location at the Bellagio. We have never had a problem there.",0
1611,"Terrible DJ. Watered down drinks. Extremely poor service. On a slow night we had to walk the restaurant to find our server and he hadn't been back in 25 minutes. The reviews on here are spot on. Great location, but you wonder if there is even a manger here. \n\nWe ordered the brownie for dessert and it might have been the worst restaurant brownie I've ever had. Literally tasted like they took it out of the freeze, unwrapped it and put it on our table. After we paid the bill ($53 for 3 small, watered down drinks and a brownie) our server said he'd take it off the bill (there was one bite gone after an hour) but then couldn't remove it because he said he ran the card already. \n\nDon't come here.",0
1612,"It PAINS me to write this review after so many great ones. I actually met I think the  the owner in the local Smith's grocery store  about a month or so before it opened. The guy asked me if I had facebook and I immediately said mmmmm..NO. (I didn't know who he was) He then said that if I did, he wanted to ask if I could \""""Like\"""" his donut shop on FB that will be opening. I had two thoughts after this #1-How could I \""""Like\"""" something that hasn't opened yet and #2-OMG a new donut shop, I'm soooo excited! I told him that I will be there as SOON as they opened!\n\nI would first like to say that my LOVE not like but my  LOVE of donuts are SERIOUS.However, in fairness I am a glazed twist type of gal. I HATE donuts that aren't fresh, I hate them so much that I arrive usually at donut shops as early as I possibly can to get the fresh batch! Onto the actual review....\n\nThe shop is so CUTE! PINK EVERYWHERE! The customer service was AWESOME. The guy with the pink shirt was so friendly and asked all my questions. I looked at the options of the donuts and was a little frightened..I'm not the adventurous type. After looking at bacon donuts and bleu cheese mixed maple..somethin..somethin..apple..idk I picked a simple GLAZE and JELLY donut. I was so happy because the guy told me that the glaze was FRESH. I couldn't even wait until I got home to eat it! I felt the warmth of the glaze from inside the bag!! How can you drive all the way home with knowing that?NOT I!!! So I grabbed that beautiful warm donut  and took a huge bite. My first thought was CRUNCHY..CRUNCHY? The inside wasn't as \""""fluffy\"""", as I would've liked. It was more of a FRIED HARD DUMPLING with glaze. It was more of a CAKE DONUT texture inside rather than a...fluffy..light donut. The inside tasted like it had maybe nutmeg or cinnamon or..both which was a DIFFERENT taste.I just wasn't expecting it. My purpose of getting a SIMPLE donut was to to get a SIMPLE donut. I dont think this is a SIMPLE donut place! I went home and tried the jelly donut. The \""""jelly\"""" was sour, it seemed homeade but..sour. My bf liked the orignal glaze but didn't like the jelly filled at all. He thought it was pretty sour too. He only liked the original glaze when it was warm, apparently it tasted \""""DIFFERENT\"""" when it cooled off. That was just his opinion.The icing they put on their donuts aren't enough for ME. I would like a balance of the Krispy Kreme and Winchells icing amount.\n\n ughh I feel so bad doing this review because I think the people were soooooo NICE, but it just wasn't what I was a fan of. I think I was looking for a SIMPLE..BORING donut place and got..if Dr Seus owned a donut shop place. If you're looking for something different try them out! This just wasn't a good fit for me sadly.",1

1614,"My husband has been raving about this place for months and I finally went today.  I kept thinking, its just hot dogs, what is the big deal?  But I was thoroughly impressed and I will definitely go back.  The owner and cook were friendly and our food came out quick and just as we ordered.  My husband is one of the pickiest eaters on the planet, so the fact that this place has him eating sweet and savory flavor combos on a hot dog is enough to warrant 4 stars, and the fifth star is just because it was so darn tasty.",1
1615,"I like to make my review short and simple.  Get off your computer, get in your car, turn the air conditioner on, drive down (or up ) to switch and leave the rest of the work to the fabulous chef and other great people who work there.  Seriously, The lamb appetizer did this little happy dance in my mouth.  My daughter and I both enjoyed different salads.\nMy daughter had TWO Sangria's, and loved them both.  The waiter was tons of fun.  The place was moderately busy but, the one very hysterical waiter had it under control and he let us know it.  Yep, I love to switch!",1
1616,"Avoid at all costs.\n\nFood is bland, over priced and meals don't come with much.\nAlso never eat there. Music was skipping incessantly and the waiter sprayed pink stuff from a windex bottle all around the air in the restaurant when we were sitting there and it was all I could taste the whole time.\n\nReally the worst experience ever.",0
1617,"My favorite Indian restaurant (Gaylord) is now out of business and other Indian restaurants I've been to have been mediocre which is why I'm so glad I gave Mount Everest a try eventhough the place was kind of creepy.  The quality of the food is comparable to Gaylord's but you get more food and pay a lot less.  The people that work here are very nice and friendly.  They have Bollywood videos on at all times.\n\nThey give you a basket of papadum with mint and tamarind sauces.  We started of with samosa (they're like potato-filled empanadas with ginger and spices) and aloo tikki (fried patties of mashed potatoes in chick pea batter).\n\nMango Lasi:\nCreamy mango shake. 5/5\n\nVeggie Samosa:\nYou get two pieces for $4.  The crust was the right thickness and wasn't too doughy.  You can definitely taste the spices.  I had to use the tamarind sauce to tone down the heat a bit. Very filling. 4/5\n\nAloo Tikki:\nYou get 2 patties for $4. Crispy deep-fried mashed potatoes.  Very filling as well.  Great flavor. 5/5\n\nPalak Paneer:\nI was looking for the cheese on top since that's what I'm used to.  4/5\n\nGarlic Naan:\nI love this stuff.  We had 2 orders.

They're like hot cheese dougnuts in simple syrup. 5/5\n\nI honestly wasn't expecting the food to be that good.  This is my new favorite in Vegas!

1618,"If you watch Mad Men, you notice that only upper crust, ubber wealthy people use to ride on airplanes.  It was a major luxury to be able to spend that much to get around.   Then coming back to the present time... it's still a luxury to be able to fly, however, it's more of a necessity now.  Especially, when driving to LV from SF takes way too long for my taste.  Plus, time is money!  \n\nI've traveled to and from Las Vegas many times and the service is always pretty good.  It's been on time, the lines move smoothly and efficiently, and the overhead compartments for my luggage is pretty easy to take care of.  I don't have any complaints.  And this time, we arrived 15 minutes early to LV, which is good because time is money, honey.",1
1619,"Two stars because I couldn't quite give it three...  We tried this place because we had a coupon and we heard that they had vegetarian options.\n\nThe service was slow and inattentive.  We were seated in a place that seemed to be tucked away almost like they didn't want to have to look at us.  That's alright, but the waiter should have checked in on us a little more instead of just taking it for granted that we would tip him.  Or, maybe he was frightened of us?  \n\nFood was slow in getting to us, but not so slow that I would have walked out.  The music was too loud, it was distracting and made it seem like the wait was longer.  We got to stare at the pretentious decor for a little too long.  But, we figured if the food is good, it doesn't matter too much.  \n\nWe had gluten free pizzas with vegan cheese.  It was okay...they skimped on the vegan cheese horribly.  But, the pizza was hot when we got it so I guess that was a plus.  I was expecting it to be cold because the server seemed to avoid us...or maybe this was because it was so loud and he knew he couldn't hear us or it was hurting his hearing at the spot where we were?  Who knows.\n\nThe pizzas were not large enough.  We ordered two so we could take pizza back to another family member.  Both of us made an effort to stop eating so there would be enough to take with us. \n\nThe WORST part of it was discovering how much the bill was at the end.  This was a very expensive place to eat.  The prices were not clearly marked on the menu for the gluten-free things or I would probably have walked out in the beginning.  We were charged $3 extra for vegan cheese...but as I said they put so little on the pizzas.  So, the little pizzas we ordered ended up being $22 each, the drinks were $6 each, we got an appetizer and we had a $10 off coupon.  For two people to eat a pizza dinner it was $57 AFTER the coupon.  \n\nIt wasn't worth it.  I won't go back.  There's other places to eat.  I don't know if this place thinks it is trendy and that makes it worth it?  I was looking forward to eating there because I heard about it from a few people that went to the other location in Phoenix.  The ambiance didn't make up for any of it.\n\nAnyhow...work on your pricing, work on your service and train your servers to be more attentive, and maybe turn down your music so people can enjoy themselves instead of feeling tortured.  Or maybe this is so people don't linger too long?  But then again if that were it, the food would have come faster?\n\nThe place wasn't all that busy for a Saturday night at 7:30, but finding a place to park was difficult.  \n\nMellow Mushroom needs to work on things a bit. :)  I know that gluten free, vegan fare is somehow more expensive....but this was a little ridiculous.",0
1620,"This place is amazing! They close early so get there earlier! The donuts are amazing and selection is awesome (if you get there early enough). It's a hole in the wall kinda place and the lines usually leads outside but boy is it worth it. If you like donuts and haven't been here, shame on you. They are all cake type donuts and those clearly are the best. I have nothing but compliments for this place so let's just save each other some time I'll stop writing, you stop reading, just go there. Right now...... Why are you still reading?! GO!!",1

1622,"I just experienced again an issue I have registered several times before with Customer Svc, and never had addressed: a customer for 10 yrs, yet while watching a program on a channel for which I've paid, the program is interrupted by a screen informing me how to purchase that channel. The interruption tonight occurred during a key scene in the long-awaited Downton Abbey 4th Season premiere, and lasted long enough that I never found out what the discussion was about. NO ONE ever even addresses my complaint or inquirey regarding why this happens with various channels, all channels for which I've been paying many years. I've asked if it has to do with the cable box, but still no response. Add this to the similar complaints lodged by others about the overcharging, the fact that they allow contracted field cable svc workers to help neighbors/their friends access svcs for free in my apt complex, while I pay for those svcs, and it adds up to a real problem at times. I have found the internet svc to be pretty reliable, but no one answers my questions about why I am charged for the highest level speed of internet when I've requested information about purchasing the slower rates, esp when the cost of internet far exceeds what my employer will reimburse me for using. Oh, and when they \""""improved\"""" their billing format, it has made if far more difficult to understand and no one can answer questions about what some fees are about.Lots of room for improvement.",0
1623,"I went here yesterday for a spring training game between the Cubs and Doggers.  In addition to my previous review I have few more issues with this stadium.\n\nThis was a major event.  A sellout.  This sort of thing only happens a handful of times a year at cashman.  There was absolutely nobody directing traffic.  Nobody at the 95 and Vegas blvd.  Nobody at Vegas blvd and Bonanza.  Nobody at Vegas blvd and Washington.  I don't expect to not wait in traffic.  But I do expect a minimum amount of event planning when this event has been held for countless years and I pay double the amount of what a spring training ticket should cost.\n\nIn addition to nobody directing traffic, there was also no security or no ushers once we arrived 30 minutes late.  Security is needed because there are dogger fans.  Everyone knows that dogger fans are classless and typically carry weapons.  Nobody checked my bag when entering.  I didn't pay ridiculous ticket prices just so I could be stabbed by a thug.  \n\nUshers are needed because apparently people from Las Vegas have never attended a baseball game.  Lots of people sitting in the wrong seats.  Lots of people going up and down the aisles while a player is batting.  This shouldn't be happening.",0

I'm a big fan of this type of cuisine: if there's hummus, aubergines, and lamb then count me in. And if it's BYOB even better. Nile Valley ticks all of these boxes, and is therefore firmly on my roster of places to get a good dinner with friendly service in Edinburgh. \n\nThe staff are very accommodating and will even find you a table during the festival.

1625,"Excellent buffet. My family and I went for the lobster/wine buffet on Sunday night. Got in with minimal waiting. I'm a red wine snob, so tried both red and white and opted for the Chardonnay, as the Malbec served was weaker in flavor. The lobster came quickly was served hot, tender and moist. The salads were fantastic... watermelon with jicama, tomatoes with figs, marinated mushrooms with garlic & peppers, and a medley of olives, cornichons, garlic & rosemary. Nice sushi selection for apps, but basic rolls, nothing unusual. Massive amts of crab legs with fresh lemon and drawn butter. The Asian green bean and beef entree was seasoned well and veggies crisp and flavorful. The lobster ravioli was delicious and very  gourmet. The tandoori chicken, naan and curry were great! The roasted veggies had pitty-pans (baby squash) which are pretty pricey at the market.The lamb was overcooked for my taste and difficult to get a rare slice. All in all very well done with minimal disappointments. Not  a huge selection for dessert, but all we tried was light and tasty. Service was ok... seemed understaffed for as pricey as it is! Nice fresh and light decor and very clean. Not your standard buffet fare, so important to go with an open mind willingness to try! I would definitely go again!",1
1626,"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and was very happily surprised at my dining experience.\n\nThe hostess was friendly, waiter funny and attentive, and other staff said goodbye to us as we left.\n\nHad to have edamame to start of course, and for the first time ever at a Japanese restaurant, they were steaming hot and not over salted.\n\nI had the salmon roll and a shrimp tempura roll. Tasty and fresh.  ---sorry but I'm not a fan of shashimi, so I stick to rolls.\n\nHad another dish called \""""Dragon Tails\"""" which was chicken stir fried in  a spicy, almost buffalo style hot sauce. Huge portion.\n\nWhen I peaked at the other diners across the room every portion looked really big! I mean at least two if not three portions per serving.\n\nOur entree was out a few minutes earlier than the sushi, the waiter came by a few times and kept us updated, but it seemed as if he knew the sushi would come out later so why not wait 5 min then turn out order in to the kitchen?\n\nNice yummy, hassle free lunch.

1627,The gym itself is nice The staff are nice and helpful but look out for the finance company Jonas Fitness. They are absolutely awlful to deal with. I would give Golds a 4 if they did not work with Jonas Fitness. They have been caught in lies about payments and are quick to charge overdraft fees that are a nightmare to straighten out. This company cheapens the brand name golds gym world wide. The nicest thing I can say about Jonas Fitness is they are repulsive and have no idea of what character and integrity means.

1629,"Steve and Claudia are very rude.  Michael Reiss is a nice guy, but has hired the two rudest, most incompetent, morons imaginable.  These people scammed me out of $350 after stealing it out of my deposit.  We rented from these people for 1.5 years.  We had a 3BR house and we are single family.  Before we left we spent a couple hundred to get it spotless and our lawn guy came (as he did every month) to get the lawn in order.  They still charged us $150 for the lawn service and $100 for cleaning service.  What they do is, they wait until the end of the month to take pictures of the lawn and the house.  Of course after a month of no one living in it the weeds are going to grow back and the house is going to get dusty.  Then they take pictures of everything and charge you double.  This is the most unethical and conniving company I have ever dealt with.  If you have a chance to talk to Claudia or Steve, just punch yourself in the face, you'll have a better time with it.",0
1630,"Daily Dose is hands down my favorite restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale. I began going there when it first opened for brunch and was highly impressed by the multiple options they have available for the ways in which you can order Eggs Benedict. You can get them with roasted red pepper, asparagus, chorizo or my personal favorite...thinly sliced prime rib. In addition, they give you the option to order them \""""DD style\"""" in which they replace the  english muffin and hollandaise sauce with a biscuit and gravy. \n\nAfter enjoying their brunch on multiple occasions, I became curious about their happy hour. Not only do they have the most convenient happy hour schedule (4-8pm!) but their menu options are amazing as well. Unlike their morning hours during which there tends to be quite a wait time for a table, there is always availability during dinner time and the atmosphere is very comfortable. I don't think I have ever had anything from Daily Dose that was not to like.  Their sangria is delicious also:) \n\nSome of my  favorite menu items: \n\nButternut Squash Ravioli \n\nPrime Rib Eggs Benedict \n\nTacos (any)\n\nVeggie Dip\n\nChicken Nachos (their salsa is great) \n\nPanko Crusted Calamari\n\nCilantro, Jalapeno & Edamame Hummus\n\nChocolate Cake MMMmmm!",1

There are tons of different combinations of mixings and ingredients you can choose from to build your own enchilada. Tons of different meats, sauces, and veggies to choose from. You could really try a new flavor combination every time you go in. The atmosphere here and the patio make for a great time. They also have several bottled beers available for purchase that would compliment your meal very well. The staff members here were also very nice and helpful to my friends and I when we told them this was our first visit.

1634,"Let me first say how excited I was that a taco shop of any variety was opening near my house and place of work.  Staring outside my work window watching them refurbish this location for the past 6 months got me excited for something new.  I have been 4 times and have told myself never again. This last time (9-7-2014), I really mean it. \n\nOrdering is a weird thing. Since each item has to be placed into the computer, individually the process takes forever. There is no number system when you order. Just one item at a time. This adds up when you have five people in front of you.  They give you a pager after you order. One visit, my pager never went off. The employee walked aimlessly around the restaurant trying to locate the person who ordered it. When she finally found us she asked if we would like for them to make it again because it's cold.  Really?  Why did they ask us knowing its cold?  We said yes,  25 seconds later our food was back.  It was apparent they just zapped it in the microwave.   \n\nFood.  Food is okay.  Each time I ordered, it came out slightly warm to cold. The \""""crispy\"""" tacos shells as they call it, is the same exact thing as the hard taco shells you buy from the grocery store and heat in oven-no flavor, dry and stale. The soft tortillas are also store bought/Taco Bell tortillas.  So really the price you pay is not worth it.  They have two flavors of rice; Mexican and cilantro lime rice.  Both tasted like they were microwaved.  The have Latin fried potatoes that also tasted like they were microwaved which are dry and crunchy.  I also decided to get a side of green sauce.75( I think) for a shot glass size cup.  The same size you pump ketchup in at other fast food places.  I felt totally ripped off. \n\nI hope management reads these reviews.  They need to change the tortillas and hard shells at the very least. With better options nearby, I won't be surprised if they are closed within a year.  \n\nOverall, not worth the price and headache for the wait and stale food.  You're better off spending that money at Garcias down the street, tee pees on Indian school and 40th street or a Filiberto's.",0
1635,"Had Thanksgiving Dinner today and my wife had one of their fish specialities. Both were excellent and our server, Leandrea provided outstanding service.\nWhat really impressed us was the gracious way the manager handled a mishap at a neighboring table. Very impressive and making us sure to return.  Kudo's to the staff at this restaurant.",1
1636,"It's weird that that the reviews are so skewed for Capriottis Sandwich Shop. I have eaten here several times, and have enjoyed it each time. I think the thing that hurts them more than anything else is the \""""Best Sandwich In America\"""" banner hanging out front. The sandwiches are really good... but best in America is a little far reaching.\n\nThat being said... I usually get the \""""Bobby\""""... Thanksgiving on a bun! It's a pretty damn good sandwich... it you like thanksgiving dinner. The turkey is freshly made, as is the stuffing they put on the sandwich. \n\nI have also had the meatball sub... also very good. \n\nI like this place. And I am pretty sure you will like this place. \n\nMake sure you tell them you signed up for their \""""text message\"""" program to get a free drink and chips on your first visit.",1
1637,"We went to Nakato last night for dinner.  The food was average in taste, much smaller portions and higher prices than before, and the service was not good at all.  We waited a long time for our courses and forever for our check.  My wife had to remind the waiter that she hadn't gotten her sushi order.  We had a coupon and they added 18% for a gratuity, per the coupon, which we didn't see beforehand -- the coupon is a scam so watch out.  We wouldn't have tipped that much based on the above comments.  Our table mates asked for a birthday greeting which never happened.  Yes, we have been eating here for 15 plus years but likely will not return as things have declined so much recently.  No one ever came to our table to ask how things were going -- a sign of poor customer relations.",0
1638,"I had been to Snooze in Boulder, CO and fell in love, so when they opened one here I was shocked! I love the atmosphere and the staff are always friendly. I've had the Sandwich I Am, the Breakfast Burrito and the heaping mound of hash browns and cheese that you get to add toppings to ( I chose chorizo and onion). Every item I have been thoroughly impressed with. So good. \nThe only downfall to this place is they need to expand or open more locations because the wait time is ridiculous, even on weekdays. But, I guess that just shows how good the food is. Also, a huge disappointment for me is their coffee! How can you have such delicious food and such terrible coffee? They even have a great back story to the coffee and it still tastes bad. The location In boulder had good coffee so I'm not sure where the disconnect is.",1
1639,"Great place, got the *Cast Iron Roasted Top Sirloin Open-faced BLT & Saut\u00e9ed Spinach. Wow! Sirloin was great but I've never had a huge, thick slice of bacon on a huge piece of garlic bread, amazing, sauteed spinach is my go to, enjoyed my jack and diet, awesome stuff.",1
1640,"Family run Italian, at the heart of Hanover Street's array of restaurants, La Lanterna is something of an Edinburgh institution.\n\nOverall, we said: \""""La Lanterna served our needs incredibly well. It offers a warm welcome, friendly service, hearty dishes full of satisfyingly home-spun gutsiness, and an atmosphere guaranteed to put you at your ease.

1641,After hearing about this pub from a friend a few times - I had to check it out. The majority of Yelp reviewers pointed out that the Strawberry beer was great and the atmosphere was unique and cool. I agree. Most of the reviewers also stated the food could be improved - agreed. It wasn't bad - it just wasn't that great.\n\nI give this pub 4 stars because it is a unique place and they do have decent custom beers. I recommend this place for happy hour.,1
1642,"Ok I love coffee bean tea leaf, I love that they have more of a tea selection because I'm not a coffee drinker. But I'm disappointed with the way this location makes it. The past three times I've stopped here it's been wrong. Even with me giving them direction. I think they are more consumed with talking to friends then being a barista.",0
1643,"I have dined in at Abuelo's once and eaten their take-out at least three times.  I have to admit, this restaurant doesn't do much for me. I think this is because I'm a vegetarian and there just isn't much on the menu for me.   Tonight I had their cheese and onion enchiladas, which were perfectly fine...but I wasn't wowed. Why then, you ask, am I giving them a 4-star review? Well, because it seems as though everyone else who has dined with me has really enjoyed their food. I have not heard a single complaint from anyone else who has eaten at Abuelo's. Their chips and salsa are great - the chips are light and airy with the perfect amount of salt and the salsas taste very fresh and, as a person who doesn't love salsa, I think they are pretty awesome.  My friend who was born and raised in Mexico said everything he tried was really flavorful and good - he clearly knows better than I do.  When I dined in, our server was wonderful, a funny young man (that makes me sound really old) who was did a great job with a bunch of half drunk 30-something women. So, while Abuelo's probably wouldn't be MY first pick of a dinner restaurant, it has proven time and time again that it is, overall, a quality restaurant for those who have more choices on the menu.",1
1644,"While the food was good it was disturbing to find an ANT in my drink!  All the restaurants I have ever had an issue of some sort a manager came and apologized, here I got no response at all.  I wasn't looking for a free meal just some concern about the ant that somehow got into my drink.",0
1645,"OMG... Worst room Pyramid Room ever! Let me count the ways:\n\n1) Elevators feel like I'm riding in a subway/train cart. SO rickety.\n2) Dim room with no adaquete lighting.\n3) No complimentary coffee! (Free water though)\n4) The shower in our room was clogged and would not drain! Gross.\n5) Room, although smoke-free, reeked of smoke and even got in to the clothes I did not wear.\n6) We place the privacy sign on our door before we left because we didn't want them to clean the room. Got back and surprise! It was clean... Unfortunately, they also threw away my contact cases in the process... I called front desk to complain, whom then transferred me to Housekeeping where no one answered. Great. Thank goodness I always bring a spare set and could throw my old ones away.\n\nDefinitely would not stay here again!",0
1646,"Local outdoor store with a small selection of clothes and gear. The selection for rock climbing gear was very limited. The store was clean and well organized. Prices were on par with MSRP. So, why two stars? Well, I don't particularly care for being followed around by employees as I peruse the store. I'll take my business elsewhere.",0
1647,"My fiance and I went to this location for dinner, our receipt lists the time as being 8:42 p.m. He had been to Red Robin a few times, but this was my first, and most likely my last. He hadn't had any problems the times he's been before, but everything about this visit was awful. First, we asked for a booth and we were sat way on the end by a door, and it was only a half booth, the other side were chairs... it felt a bit like being in a hallway. I used the restroom before we ordered, and it was not clean. There were two open stalls, one looked clogged, and the other one I used did not have toilet paper installed. Luckily, there was a wrapped roll elsewhere I grabbed first. One of the sinks was leaking and constantly running and there were paper towels overflowing all on the floor. When I got back we ordered water to drink, which tasted awful. By 2014, I would expect restaurants to know how important it is to people to have filtered water. Fries were brought to our table, but the server did not clear the empty tray, someone else did as they were walking by, and our \""""bottomless\"""" fries were not refilled. We ordered, and waited. The food seemed to take a long time for what it was, and our server again, was not the one to help us. Someone else brought out our food and our server was nowhere to be found for most of the evening. She did not check in on how the food was, and I had to wait a long time for her to walk by so I could flag her down with a question. I asked if I was served the kids meal of what I ordered - I ordered the battered chicken and shrimp - which came to the table looking dismal, and quite frankly ridiculous. I have a photo I will post. It is a giant plate of fries - as if they are the main part of the entree - and just a few small pieces of chicken and shrimp tossed on to the side as if they are the garnish. It looks laughable in the photo. When I asked if this was the kids meal, she said no it was the adult size, and did not offer to bring out anything else to make it more of a meal. Both my fiance and I were flabbergasted that you would charge $12.99 + tax and tip for this - it was overcooked, the shrimp were rubbery, and quite honestly, I could have bought this at the grocery store for wayyyy less money and made it better myself. My fiance's drink ran empty most of the night, as did his fries. We waited for our check to come, and the only time our server came back quickly to the table was to collect our money and her tip. Overall it was one of the worst eating-out experiences I've ever had... The chicken was half the size of the chicken strips at Applebee's, just an FYI, and they charge about half what you charge... they are double the size there and they serve it with three pieces.",0
1648,"I am not a huge fan of going out during the weekends. I try to avoid the rif-raf that inundate old town during the weekends. But, there are a couple places I will go to on a Friday or Saturday night. Kazimierz is one of them. It's intimate (so I can actually talk to my friends and not over the music), has great wine and liquor list (priced reasonably relative to other places), great service, and knowledgeable staff. \n\nI'm not a huge fan of the food there, but the liquor list is good enough for me. \n\nPlus, most other customers that go there are like minded individuals that don't want to deal with the same old town crap or it's date night (which means the guys are on their best behavior).",1
1649,"Loved it. We went there around 6 pm on a Thursday and did not have to wait in line at all. The desserts were great. I think the food was more rich than Bacchanal but the Bacchanal has more selections. The ice cream/ gelato was amazing. I like how you can order your on mac and cheese. Also, the pizza was awesome. It does not taste like those other crappy pizzas you get from other buffets. I also recommend trying the mashed potatoes. Also, good service!",1
1650,"Came here with a couple of friends a while back, since it's one of the few restaurants in PGH that serves Malaysian food.  One of my friends and I spent several months in S.E. Asia back in 2010, and we were excited to see laksa, one of our favorite dishes, on the menu.  Since it was awhile ago, I don't remember specifics about the flavor profile, etc., but I remember that we were both impressed with the quality for a place in PGH.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty laid back, though I agree that it's dark.  Don't remember much about service, so it must have been okay.  If you're looking for decent S.E. Asian food in PGH, give it a try!",1
1651,"Honestly, you can't get much better than Hough's if you are a fan of delicious beer.  And oh, yes, delicious food.  But let's focus on the beer first.\n\nHundreds of options of every beer you can imagine from any region.  Many, many choices on tap but an unbelievable bottle selection.  And then do there darn tootin best to serve you the beer you choose in a glass tumbler bearing the name of said beer.  It's the little things that make places special.  \n\nI've eaten here many times and have enjoyed crab cakes, burgers, wraps, and excellent appetizers.  Hough's has put Greenfield on the map.",1
1652,"I booked this hotel on Orbitz for a weekend away with my boyfriend. Only one block away from Fremont Street, the El Cortez Hotel and Casino is Old Las Vegas for old Las Vegas. I loved the location and the atmosphere and how the rooms bathrooms had geriatric railings. (Okay, so I find that funny.) For the price you could pay for an hour on the Strip, we were able to stay for three nights Downtown. A very short walk from Fremont Street Experience and all the other Downtown Hotels. I would definitely stay here again.",1
1653,"Ill start my review by stating that ive been working in the food industry for 7 years now, all fine dining.  I know what works and what doesnt, and what i should expect when eatting at places. With that being said.\n\nMy wife and dined here and i was very disappionted with the over all experiance.  I think the thing that bothered me the most was the wine manager, after saying that we would be hving a 6 course dinner and would not be pairing it with the wine but would be ordering individual glasses of wine and cocktails he just lost all interest in providing an enjoyable experiance.\n After ordering our first drinks and finishing it, a manhattan for myself and champagne for her i was asked if we would like another drink; which i agreed to. instead of bringing out the wine menu again i was made to just state what type of wine i would like, the sommelier brought a glass of cab and just dropped it at the table- no mention of year, make, and region, just a heres a glass of wine, i didnt know if it was a 5 dollar a bottle wine or a 35 dollar a glass wine, nothing. And on top of it all it was corked. \nLuckally they removed it and took it off the bill, they brought out another and the som just dropped it off again, i had to stop him before he walked away and ask what he just gave us, he repllied a cabernet. I litterally had to prompt him with \"""" where does it come from, when was it made, who makes it.\""""\n\nIf i could grade just the som i would give him a zero, the man has given up on even trying to provide for his clients.\n\nGetting into the food, it was ok not worth what we paid for, the amuse was enjoyable, as well as the duck which was cooked perfectly, but the other 4 courss were average. The smoked sweet potato puree, coupled with the beef and sauce was just way too sweet, totally killed the meat.\n\nI think what put the nail in the coffin while eatting here was the check at the end.  They automatically add 20% gratutity to the bill, it doesnt matter what type of service you get. With the staff already nowing they are getting theirs is it any wonder they could care less.\nFour star 4 diamond yea right.",0
1654,Never knew this was by the Eastern gym. Stopped in after the gym just to browse. This place is smaller than most rhapsodielle stores. I don't know if it was just the day I went but there was hardly any merchandise. It wasn't very clean and organized. \n\nYou can find really cheap clothes at Rhapsodielle but beware you do get what you pay for. The quality isn't as good but I have had clothes last forever from here. They do have a lot of cute stuff. If i just need a quick outfit I run down to rhapsodielle.,0
1655,"first impressions after getting out of the car:  \""""What is that awful smell!  It smells like the sewer is backed up out here!\""""\n\nNot how it smelled when we walked into the place though.  We were greeted by an eager young man looking to make sure we were well taken care of.  \n\nMy bride & I placed our orders and searched for a clean place to sit down...  \""""Clean\"""" is the operative word.  It seems the guests are sloppy, so we asked the previously mentioned young man to clean a table (and seats) for us, and he gladly did so.\n\nThe burgers were tasty, the fries were as expected.  \n\nMy first time at an in & out burger, and I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised.  Good value, tasty food - probably not very good FOR me though.  I'm sure my arteries will complain later.",1
1656,I probably didn't pick the right item...  I got the gyro and wasn't impressed.  The only thing impressive was the size.  It was sadly very lacking in flavor. \n\nExtra star for the fact that I had their roast beef sandwich as an Ironman Arizona volunteer and that one was good. But nothing I would write home about.,0
1657,"We had an amazing experience here on April 6, 2014. We came for late lunch, about 3pm. The restaurant was very clean, beautifully decorated, and the ambiance was so nice! \n\nCollette was our server and she was so accommodating and helpful! We had never had Filipino food in a restaurant setting, and she was really helpful in making choices, and also in making sure that everything our kids ordered was GLUTEN SAFE. Both of our kids have Celiac Disease, and so many restaurants either don't understand, or don't care about those with food allergies. Max's staff was both knowledgeable and caring! My kids did NOT get sick!\n\nWe Had Pancit Bihon, Pancit Canton, Crab Fried Rice, Whole Chicken Meal, Half Chicken Meal and Halo-halo for dessert.  DELICIOUS!!!!\n\nIt was also my daughter's birthday, and the staff sang to her and gave her a complimentary dessert. Very sweet. \n\nThank you Max's Las Vegas for a wonderful experience! We will be back!!",1
1658,I was so excited to go here that my expectations went a bit too high. I think an actually requirement of working here is to be from Brazil. I wonder how that exactly works out... All the meat that we tried was really delicious however a lot of the times it was extremely rare. I like my meat a bit more cooked and when I asked for medium it was like they suddenly avoided our table. The buffet didn't match the cost of the meal. For that price they should be bringing all the food to me.  Over all I dont think I would go back.,0
1659,"A lovely idea for a business and I was looking forward to trying this place when it opened last year. However, when I went along and tried some of the beers on offer, I was totally shocked at the prices being charged. Prices vary from around \u00a36 to nearly \u00a310 for a litre of beer! That is way more expensive than pub prices (as an average), so I fail to see how this business can be a success going forward. Yes, I understand that dealing in small batches of beer and regularly changing the beers on offer, will add cost but if you get yourself to somewhere like Stewart Brewing at Loanhead you get draught beer to take away in bottles, in exactly the same way as Growler Beers of Morningside but Stewart's are around half the price with draft beer ranging from around \u00a33.80 to less than \u00a35. There can be no justification for this kind of extra cost being charged by Growler Beers and I think the owner needs to rethink his strategy, as every time I pass the shop, it is empty. It looks like the high prices are keeping the punters away! Oh and by the way, Stewart Brewing do some excellent beers!",0
1660,"My boyfriend and i went there for an ayce quick lunch, food was decent wait time for the food was horrible. The place wasn't busy there was 2 couples other then myself and my boyfriend there. We ordered.....20 minutes later we got 2 rolls. The rolls were good so, we decided to order some more..... waited another 25-30 minutes. Food was okay not worth the wait though. So our quick lunch turned into a really long production. Probably will not go back.",0
1661,"Taken my daughter to this office a few times, but won't anymore. The good points- the office is clean. The staff that answers the phone is nice and usually helpful.  The hygienists are all really nice and are kid friendly.  On the downside- when you walk into this place it just feels cold.  The staff won't even greet you since you have to sign in at a computer.  Dr. Ash wasn't as kid-friendly and a little bullish with my daughter.  I understand she was crying, but she didn't do anything to make her feel more comfortable.  They seem to be all about money; they are very aggressive about making future appointments and overcharging when they can.  I would not recommend anyone to this place.",0
1662,"Well, dont let the name fool you.............. this was a nice surprise. The food quite good, the onion rings were pretty damn good, served cold would have \""""ROCKED\"""" if served hot~\n   The place has a fun feel to it with the drawings & pick up lines on the walls.\n   The only issue were girl taking our order & serving the food. Both had issues keeping the orders straight... They were not busy and our orders still were not right however it was just a matter of getting the right food with the right sides on the right plates...... this would not put me off on returning. The girl who took our order was helpful on explaining the menu. The next time we are in the area we would come back if in the mood for a dog or wings.",1
1663,"No thanks.\n\nNormally I try to go to a place a couple times before writing a review, but I don't want to go back.\n\nI was feeling sick today (a wintery day after the students have left for the semester) and went looking for comfort food.  Spicy food seemed like it'd be good for congestion, and I hadn't tried Torticas.  Well, Torticas was closed, so I continued down Green Street to Burrito King.  I remembered how the reviews were kind of mixed here on Yelp - either really high or really low - and decided to check it out.\n\nThe good: The server was quick and polite, and I had horchata right away.  And a basket of chips, which were the best part of the meal.  The prices are pretty much in line with a campus place, maybe a bit cheaper than some..\n\nThe rest: I tried to order a torta but I guess they didn't have any.  I ordered the fajita burrito instead, because it's in the name and since I didn't see anything about cheese sauce in the description.\n\nComes out with cheese sauce.  Smells kinda strange - almost like plastic?  The veggies just taste weird and are not crisp at all.  The meat is chewy and also has that weird taste that reminds me of plastic or chemicals.  Cheese sauce is really no good - salty but not much else in terms of flavor.  \n\nI ate about a third of it, trying to make sure I didn't just get a bad bite or something, but it tasted strange and unappealing.  Other than the weird flavor, it was pretty bland - and no hot sauce on the table at all, which is weird for a Mexican restaurant.\n\nI like Taco Bell (sometimes) so the food smelling like chemicals isn't always even a deal-breaker.  However, I also like Mas Amigos and Taco Loco for their cilantro and onion tacos and spicy flavors - and would definitely recommend them, or even Taco Bell, over Burrito King.  If you like food like Mas Amigos and do not want the most midwesternized Mexican I've had, then don't go here.",0
1664,"My wife and I recently dined at Mizumi, while on a short stay at the Wynn, and I'd like to share the experience. The ambiance, while understandably over the top (this is Las Vegas after all), was duly charming, with a large waterfall serving as an impressive backdrop to the dining experience. \n\nWe started with an expensive Toro tartar, topped with a very small amount of osetra caviar and edible gold leaf (pretty!) which was well presented, and generally enjoyable, although at $45 I would not order it again. We then ordered an assortment of sushi, including yellowfin tuna, mackerel, albacore and so on, and that's where things went wrong. At best, the fish, while reasonably well cut, was a touch \""""dry\"""" and certainly less than impressive.The flavors were somewhat subdued, and the preparation below what should be a relatively high standard, given the prices. In some cases, the use of Wasabi seemed excessive, hindering rather than enhancing. The rice itself was adequate, but nothing more. \n\nThe service, in all fairness, was courteous and professional. We were seated promptly and treated well throughout. Had the sushi risen above mere mediocrity, my review would have been far more positive, but it did not. Please note that it is only the sushi that shaped my opinion. Perhaps other dishes fair better.",0
1665,"On the whole, this restaurant does give a new patron a great slice of  European cuisine and it is worth noting that if you've never been here before that you should try it out because most of the food as it is now is delicious, but having been here in the past and knowing what these foods really were has really soured my experience.\n\nIt's been a long time since I had been back to this place since its first inception. Back then this place was one of the only occupied storefronts in a dead strip mall. This place had a menu that was meat and cheese heavy and showcased a wide assortment of Eastern Bloc varieties.\n\nThe appeal of this place in addition to the great food was the tell tale sign of a great hole in the wall joint: Authentic European food, sketchy European groups of men and women engaging in non-English conversation and a woman running the show who knew what was good and made sure you ate it.\n\nThe most notable things were:\n\nShopska salad\n-It has the creamiest Bulgarian feta cheese. Don't mistake this feta for Greek feta. This is incredible.\n\nCevape\n-Homemade fat finger sized sausages served with lepina, a type of yeasty flatbread.\n\nArtisian Charcuterie Plate/Cheese Plate\n-These 2 are definite musts for light eating and drinks\n\nLeskovacka pljeskavica\n-similar to the cevape in flavor but served like an over sized burger\n\nThere were also a few kabob-like meats and a few other sausages similar to the cevape that were so delicious.\n\nSo why the poor rating? Mostly due to the fact that what I described is what I was hoping to find on this most recent visit today.\n\nOur waiter informed us that he was brand new and didn't know much of the menu or the wine selection. He also pointed out on each trip back to our table that nobody was assisting him as he was learning. I'll point out here that for whatever reason he was not our waiter by the end of our meal.\n\nWe got the Beef Stroganoff Ragu, Thracian Clay Pot, Chicken Soup, Chebureki, Bacon wrapped dates and the Beef and Lamb Confit. We were really interested in the Thracian Clay Pot as it was recently featured on a Food Network show.\n\nThe Stroganoff was ladled over wild mushroom plemeni, a kind of Russian tortellini. This stroganoff had a lot of creamy goodness but was completely lacking the meat.\n\nI'll get to the Thracian Clay Pot shortly. The Chicken Soup was desired by my kids ages 8 and 6, as well as the bacon wrapped dates. The chicken soup was quite chunky with big chicken flavor. The first round of dates looked like they spent about 1 minute too long in the pan where one side was cooked good the other burnt. We were informed that the cook likes to cook it that way to which our reply was, \""""Please give us unburned bacon wrapped dates.\"""" They were very good about getting this order back after the rest of our items had come out.\n\nThe Chebureki was akin to a samosa where it is a flattened dough item filled with something and deep fried in this case, a delicious meat filling and topped with some dill and chopped scallions. Fairly standard in flavor and not served with any type of dipping sauce.\n\nThe Beef and Lamb Confit was tender and tasty served atop a small scoop of a dill and scallion rice. While this was tasty it was not a distinct one. My son said, \""""Is this corned beef?\"""" And you know what? He was right. It did taste a lot like the type of corned beef I'd find in a chunky hash at Hash House a go-go. But that's for another review.\n\nSo now back to the Thracian Clay Pot. It would seem that during the shuffling of waiters for our table, either our waiter put in this order incorrectly or it was given to another table because we didn't get it during the course of them bringing the rest of our order. When we questioned why the long wait, we were told that it takes a while. We didn't get it after an hour after initially ordering and 30 minutes after reordering it. So I can't tell you how melty and delicious it looked and how it would taste, but the table next to us seemed to really enjoy it.\n\nI'm not a vodka drinker so please read the other ratings for their extensive vodka menu.\n\nThis still doesn't really warrant the low rating based on the food. Where it really lacked was the overall experience now versus where it was. This place used to have people who knew the food, wasn't afraid to give locals some food they couldn't pronounce and keep true to themselves. Now, there are waitstaff that don't know the product and don't make you feel excited about their food.\n\nIf your looking for something new in Vegas and haven't been, your experience will most likely be 4-5 stars. It is not something that you will find anywhere else and that makes it unique. You will not have the displeasure of seeing a restaurant jump the shark.",1
1666,"I was very impressed with the buffet. They offered warm crab legs that are split in half so this I definitely a plus. Their sushi and dim sum was really good I had so many dumplings! The have a good variety of meat selections, ranging from prime rib, to chicken and sausage. The oysters were also very good and bigger than at other buffets. You get what you pay for and this is defiantly worth it. Dinner is about $60 a person but you will definitely be happy when you are done",1
1667,We ordered ribs to go and when we went to pick them up the staff didn't even acknowledge me. Took about 10 mins before they actually brought over my food - which they didn't even ask if I was there to pick up food. The ribs weren't amazing. Felt like they were made from a neighbor's backyard. Was hoping that they would be fall off the bone kind of ribs but they were definitely not.,0
1668,"Nice place with an eclectic style inside. I had Sushi, the specialty rolls were amazing with a great presentation. Fabulous! This place is high priced! I would not recommend this place for anyone who is looking for something more affordable. The sushi ranges from $20 for a roll of 6 pieces to $110 & although the specialty rolls are yummy $85 for one roll is outrageous! If you have the money to spend then I recommend this place. I could definitely see myself going back to try the teppanyaki grills.",1
1669,"The menu is a little pricey, and service is very hit and miss.  Sometimes the \""""slow food\"""" style will be too much, and it makes the dining experience languish.  The cocktails are delicious, the wine list is decent, nice variety, well-priced, a little pedestrian.  I would not recommend doing a prix fixed event here, it was way too much food, and the food quality dipped greatly when we did this for New Year's eve last year.",0
1670,"One of my top favorite Filipino Restaurants in Vegas. Must try the Max's Chicken, Dry Adobo and everything else on their menu! Soon they will be open late nights with drink specials and  meal deals. The atmosphere is nice and the entire staff are much nicer and respectful... You can definitely feel the \""""Filipino Hospitality\"""" when you dine here!",1
1671,"We are beyond impressed with the staff and youth at this theatre. They are caring and kind, quick to build each other up. They all are strong characters. Each class and play are well orchestrated. The performances are terrific. Costuming and make-up are amazing and the singing will take your breath away.  We just saw Seussical Jr. last night and it was very professional for a cast and crew of 8-15 yr olds. Well Done!",1
1672,"Just got back from Church Brew Works, as we had a pretty good experience. There were probably 40 people in the restaurant, but the sprawling size of the place makes it seem empty with that size crowd. It's a really cool space, between the brewing equipment and church relics, so there's a lot to look at and discuss. There's even lots of helpful info about the history of the place and beer brewing in the menu.\n\nWe started with the \""""Nontraditional Pierogies\"""" (as opposed to the Traditional Pierogies) which change periodically; today they were stuffed with potato, chicken, andouille sausage, peppers, and pepper jack cheese (that I can remember) and DARN they were tasty, just needed a bit of salt though.\n\nWe also had fries with beer cheese. The fries themselves were okay, Potato Patch style but a little overdone. The beer cheese was pretty tasty as well.\n\nFor an entree we had the \""""Cinco Formaggio\"""" (a name I find quite odd, since cinco is Spanish and formaggio is Italian...but I digress). The combination of cheeses plus pine nuts is mild and yet very yummy, the pine nuts add a nice crunch. The crust is heavenly, though I wish it had a teensy bit more salt and perhaps some butter or olive oil to moisten it a bit.\n\nWe also, of course, tried a couple beers, which were good in my book but I'm not by any means a beer connoisseur, so I can't do much describing other than to say I liked it.\n\nOur server was very friendly and helpful -- checked on us enough times, refilled my water, all that good stuff. All in all we definitely enjoyed the meal and hope to come back for more soon!",1
1673,"I love this Fry's. It is so new and so clean. The lighting is great and the staff is amazing! They have the best deals by far, even without coupons. I've never had a problem with the food and the produce is always really fresh. I like that they carry a pretty good amount of the vegetarian brands too.",1
1674,"My favorite local restaurant, however I don't get here often enough.  Waitstaff is great, and decor is lovely, especially outdoors during the summer months, twice the hostess was a little snooty however food, decor and service outweigh her attitude. \n\nMy favorite dish is the scallops, and the butter lettuce with brie salad, simply delightful and or course their pretzel bread is to die for.  In fact their simple butter presentation with olive oil is also so good.\n\nTheir wine offerings are great and cocktails are creative and yummy. I would recommend for date or girls night out.",1
1675,"We've been coming to this place for 3 years now. We order about the same thing most of the time. We are big AYCE sushi fanatics. When we first ordered, we already gave them what we usually order all at once. Then, we were questioned if we can finish it. Of course we said yes. Then we gave them our second order which is about less than half of what we first ordered. When they came back with the albacore we ordered, they gave us a regular tuna. We asked a couple times if it was really albacore and they insisted it is. We know how an albacore looks and taste like. It's one of our favorite fish and it's a must have for us. It seems like they are trying to trick customers with a different but similar looking fish or low grade items. We've tried another sushi place that did this kind of deception before but this is a first from this place. We have plenty of good sushi places in our area but we go out of our way to go to this place. We will not be coming back here anymore and so will the rest of our  family. I'm giving it 2 stars because of the promptness of the food.",0
1676,"I was contacted by San Felipe's marketing and management team after my poor experience, and I gave them two more tries to make sure it was not a fluke. Had a great time both times, saw the poor bartender again, just managed to avoid him, my waitress (sarah the first night, I can't remember the second one, was a cool dude at the bar) was awesome. Saw some live music, enjoyed some drinks, very fun. As long as I can avoid that one guy, I will keep coming back!",1
1677,"Totally unimpressed with Davanti Enoteca on Valentine's Day.  The service at the bar was good, but the specialty drinks were syrupy and lacking alcohol.  However, I would take bad drinks to the bad service my husband and I received during the sit-down dinner.  The wait staff was flat rude.  The pork dish my husband ordered was very dry, and my order of scallops was not worthy of it's pricetag.  I would not recommend this restaurant, and I do not plan on returning.  I will say some of my friends have had different experiences, but I will likely never get over the disappointment of our Valentine's dinner.  If you go here, stick to beer or wine and order pizza or pasta- hopefully they can't mess that up.",0
1678,"Was here on April 13th for dinner, been about 9 months since my last visit, price jumped to $39.99 for adults and $26.99 for kids.  I was disappointed this time around. I was here with my husband and 8 yr old kid.  When paying for our meals upfront, I told the cashier we have 3 people, she rudely asked if it's for 3 adults... I guess the obviously short 8 yr old minion that is with us looked like an adult. SMH.  After we were seated and got food, the quality of selection seem to have dropped from last year. It seemed more simplified, nothing fancy.  Our waitress (plate cleaner more like it) was also oblivious to my hand sawing the prime rib I got with a dull knife, after she had stopped by 3 times and I was already almost done with my prime rib I finally gave up asked if there were steak knifes and she said \""""yea\"""".  Eh, after seeing my husband and I both having prime rib on our plates, wouldn't the first visit to our table ring a light bulb to get us steak knives anyways!?!  \n\nFood quality has gone down, the selection of unique food seems to be less.  I did not see some of the other dishes that they had 9 months ago.  For $115 for the 3 of us and the experience was very disappointing.  For that price I'd rather just go to a steak house and have better food.  This time around, I was not impress, especially with the prices up, I would expect my experience this time around to be at least the same and was not.  Don't think I would come back again.",0
1679,"I know it would be wrongheaded to expect a great burrito from a bar and maybe I should not have ordered it.  The burrito was not good.  It was more of a vegetable wrap.  My date didn't take the burrito detour and ordered a wrap directly.  It was a lonely little thing in a plastic basket.  She described it as \""""good, not great.\""""  But these facts alone do not earn this restaurants two stars.  Mortimer's gets this rating because they served dinner, on a Friday night, with plastic silverware.  No points awarded for how amazingly close an approximation to real, shiny silverware these plastic forks and knives provided.  \n\nThe food quality, the cramped quarters, and yes, the plastic silverware all gave me the impression that I was dining on an airplane.",0
1680,Congratulations to the Democratic party for being so divided that they can't even agree on a candidate to be considered for the general election.  Nice job fellas.  You're pushing a candidate who didn't even get a clear majority of YOUR party's votes lol.  What's one half of one half?  A quarter of the whole?  Why don't you just give McCain the keys to the White House already.,0
1681,I really don't think I'm the target audience for a place like this.  I understand what they're going for with these artisan pizzas but I really would just like a little sauce on my pizza.  Just a little...\n\nThe flavors are usually good but the lack of any sauce and more often than not over cooked dough make it hard for me to want to keep coming back to places like this.,0
1682,"Just terrific.  Time and again.  Every dish bursts with flavor and the chicken tika comes out sizzling with a great seasoned crust to it, unlike other places where it's only unadorned skewered chunks of unseasoned chicken.  If they created a bit more ambience - maybe music? - and worked on the patio decor they would be a 5 star in my book.  I'm hooked.",1

You have to wait to be seated.\""""\nAt first, I thought she was uttering in foreign tongue cause I've been coming to this location for YEARS and we've never had to wait to be seated!\nTurns out, the place was fully booked.

1685,"This is one of my favorite airports for a number of reasons, ranging to the fact that the staff is pretty friendly to the number of options most terminals have as far as shops are concerned.

1686,This the the most expensive Chinese breakfast restaurant. We have 4 people and we spend about $70 dollars. I was shocked when I see the check.

1687,"I had brunch here with a friend a couple weeks ago. It was a great breakfast spot! I had the protein pancakes and some egg whites on the side! Soooo yummy! Our server was friendly and the manager came over and chatted a bit too. Nice place, old school coffee mugs that you almost wish had hot cocoa and marshmallows instead of coffee in 'em! My friend had one of the omelets with potatoes, needless to say she was busy eating rather than participating in the conversation! I'll definitely be back! Good choices for someone trying to stay on a healthier track... as long as you have the strength to choose accordingly! I'll definitely be back!",1
1688,"Great location, great drinks, free wifi! This used to be my spot while in college to study.

If you've never had Bahn mi before do yourself a favor and come here and order the Pork sandwich, you won't be disappointed.  Plus it is filling but not real heavy so perfect for lunch at work.

1699,"Here is a summary of what we experienced with Heliocol:\n-Jan 2013- Phone quote- $840 to move panels + $5/ft for new piping (?length).  Heliocol came for site survey Jan 23, but we never received a written quote for total length and price.\n-April 9 appt was rescheduled to April 10\n-April 10- No-show (I waited at home for 4 hours)\n-New appt for April 19 made.  In the meantime, Holly, a manager, confirmed pricing of $5/ft for stronger piping (SCH80) to replace 2.5 yr-old piping (SCH40) that melted from the heat generated by system (NOT under warranty anymore).  That they would install piping unable to withstand normal system working conditions speaks poorly about the company!\n-April 19- Wrong team arrived in AM.  I waited all day for the installation team to come.  System was moved to new location, but piping was not connected.\n-April 26- Installation team arrived to finish job, but gave price of $13/ft for SCH80 pipes- total price for the job was now $2500!  No work done due to pricing disagreement.\n-Week of April 29- after much discussion, Heliocol gave a final \""""discounted\"""" price of $1485.  This \""""discounted\"""" price was given due to the company's inability to give a consistent quote, not to mention \""""no quote\"""" received in January after a site survey.  We did appreciate the lower price given to us.\n-Due to this week-long delay to establish pricing, the next available appt was now May 28.  That is over one month later- with loss of use of pool solar heating, not to mention lost wages from taking time off to be available for them all these times.\n-May 28- No-show (we waited 3 hours at home).  Frustrated, we called and asked if they could come on May 29 or May 30, since we would be able to supervise the work.  They refused, and instead, scheduled us for May 31 when no one was home.  We also asked about some compensation for all this extra time.  We were told to draft an email and they would speak with the owner to \""""see what we can do.\""""  We received no response from them over a 48 hour period despite 2 emails.\n-May 31 appt- work was finally completed.  Since we were not home to supervise, we have no way of knowing whether the SCH80 piping was in fact used at all.  \n\nHeliocol feels that as customers, our time is not valuable (our installation job was cancelled/no-showed over a 51-day period willy-nilly).  Thirty-two days after the day they were supposed to finish the job was the first available appointment they could give us even though we had suffered so many setbacks due to their poor service.  One would hope that our less-than-stellar experience would encourage them to expedite our job, but that was not their plan.  In fact, they delayed us yet again on May 28 by no-showing.  We then begged them to come in the next 2 days since we would be home, but they refused to move their schedule on our behalf.  It was as if they felt entitled to postpone us because they were collecting $1000 less than originally intended.  \n\nThe email we were encouraged to send the director was met with no response after 48 hours, so I sent him another email on May 30.  His response to me on May 31 was \""""I did not respond to your email because I was responding to your BBB complaint.\""""  He was too busy to respond to his customer!

1711,"I really enjoy shopping at Ragstock.  You can find some very good deals inexpensively.  They also carry new items, which are too expensive to qualify as thrifty shopping, but are fairly reasonably priced. They always have fun and really different kinds of clothes, like brightly colored fishnet shirts or star spangled leggings, so you never know exactly what you'll find.  It's a good place to return for another visit.",1

My parents enjoy it since it's close to them.  The rolls are loaded with rice and tasteless chewy fish.  I should have ordered cooked food.  And the service.... I literally had to flag 3 servers down and it wasn't even that busy.  Definitely will not be returning.",0
1714,"I was impressed with the rooms and the location.  I was pleased that there was not a casino at this location.  These are the pros. When we arrived, I placed my luggage on the kitchen counter since it was higher than the table (and I'm tall so it was easier to look in it). Unfortunately when they turned the unit,  they left the electric stove top on but it doesn't turn red so I didn't know it was on.  Part of my luggage was touching the stove top and it caught on fire.  They reimbursed me for the damages and they were semi caring.  What was worrisome was that the room filled up with smoke and the smoke alarms never went off! I am concerned that this may happen again in the future and something tragic happens.  My next call will be to the fire marshall!",0

Have gone to this one in Chandler several times.  I always get the same thing, Jamaican Jerk Chicken.  OK, yeah, call me boring.  So I know what it tastes like.  And it always tasted the same until last Sunday, when it was different.  After a few bites i realized what I ordered isn't what I got.  So I handed it off to the manager looking dude and told him I'd prefer to get what I actually ordered.  His response was to bring it back to my table and try to convince me that what I had was what i actually ordered.  \n\nBye bye, Chandler Rumbi, I won't be back.  Mistakes are OK, they just need to be corrected.  Explain aways are not OK.",0

I the waffle was like cardboard. I couldn't eat more than one bite. I ate most of my eggs, but I felt nauseous afterwards. I also ordered hot chocolate which was pretty good, but thats about it. My husband didn't like his food either - an omelet with sausage links.  The plate with the sausage was swimming in grease. He couldn't even look at it, never mind taste it.

The bread was nice and moist and the meat was tender but lacked seasoning. I loved the new touch soda machines and the location is fairly clean.\n\nIs five guys my most favorite burger spot? Unfortunately not, but the experience given by the staff bumped it up a few notches. We were sitting outside and the staff came out to give us our food and even checked on us 15 min later to see if we were still doing ok. Great customer service because they really didn't have to do any of that. My guy friend would disagree with me and say that five guys is his go to burger joint but we can all agree to disagree. What I do know is that it's definitely worth a try!",1
1718,"The Hub is a well established events venue, which is owned by the Edinburgh International Festival, and also includes a cafe, called Cafe Hub (keeping it real) and a ticket office.

They did look for a replacement hub, but did not have one.\n\nBasically, there were three techs there.  One was actually performing work, and one was watching, and one was being trained.

1721,"We always have a good time whenever we hit the Luxor! Before, when it was still called 'Ra' it was crowded, it was fun, and there was always someone new to meet. \n\nMy girls and I unknowingly planned our trip to Las Vegas for Memorial Day weekend. I say unknowingly because I know better than to go to Las Vegas during a holiday weekend. Too many people (I just don't do big crowds), too many drunks, and clubs become too expensive. However, it wasn't my birthday and that weekend worked so we went. \n\nWe hit LAX the last night of our stay in Vegas (Sunday night). We got scammed by some dude selling club passes on the strip (in front of Caesar's, don't give him your money) so we knew it would a rough night of clubbing ahead of us. We decided to just go for it and headed to the Luxor. We weren't on a list, we didn't have passes, we were doing it 'the regular way' which I haven't done since I first started clubbing (about 10 years ago). We expected the cover to be insane, especially when we discovered that Ginuwine was performing (don't judge me, I still love Ginuwine). We were told that the cover was $20, but we could expect to pay more by the time we got to the door. Totally understandable, this is Vegas, the goal is to make money.\n\nWe got to the door in record time (less than an hour of waiting in line, score!), and we only paid $30 to get in. I look at this as a bargain because it was a holiday weekend, other clubs were charging much more and there was a performance that night.\n\nThe only real problem we had was that the club was so packed. It was really hard to finish my drink without spilling it on myself (thanks to the thousands of people milling back and forth bumping in to me). After Ginuwine performed a lot of people left so it was easier to dance. Easier, not easy. It was still super packed, no real dancing could be done and getting off the dance floor was very tricky.\n\nOver all, we had a great time; the Luxor never disappoints me. It's always an adventure when we roll through the Luxor.",1

Salad creations has a lot of creatively made salads of their own, and you can also create your own as well! They also have some wrap options, soup, and dessert. The service is real quick and organized. As soon as you walk in, you're already standing in line, and the staff greet you with a friendly smile and ask how they can help. The good thing about being in line quickly is you get served quick, but the only thing I would like to see is more menu options. \nOverall, great place, I do plan on trying their other salads and creating my own too. They have so many great and healthy toppings!!",1

Why are you such a whiny complainer? Did you now know this beforehand? Don't you follow HRH on Twitter and did they not announce publicly that there will be very limited parking like the Cosmo does?-- \n\nNo, no, no, and don't call me a complainer. \n\nNo over*flow parking, no employee(s) or basic signage informing individuals attempting to park that there was no parking and to enter the garage, on Harmon, would lead to well over an hour of wasting your petro and brain cells as you inhaled all of the exhaust of other vehicles with patrons, or potential patrons, who are just trying to park their vehicles so they can use their concert tickets to listen to some damn live music.\n\nWe live in a fairly complex world.

1726,"I have a few things to report on this place.  Since this place appeared on Restaurant Impossible it is good to report that the decor and menu are still just about the same when on the show.  Sadly, the management and higher ups haven't really changed, same mentality.\n\nWhat drew us in here was a sign on the side of the street: \""""All You Can Eat Pasta Bar.\"""" Great we thought, let's go in and try it out.  Then everything seems to have gone down the toilet.  When we got inside and attempted to order the pasta bar we were told it wasn't available due to the street festival going on outside.  Hmm, funny, because there is still a sign, if not two, posted outside advertising this.  If you were not going to honor this special (which I believe runs Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday) then maybe you should have taken in the signs for that week.\n\nWhen we decided we weren't going to dine here and let our waitress know our intentions we got this great, drawn out excuse why we shouldn't go.  Instead of honoring the all you can eat portion of this, they would hand you a card with options on it to fill in for the pasta bar.  Mind you, it wasn't even all you can eat, just whatever you checked on the card (more like a slip of paper) was what you got.  \n\nAfter sitting there and made to feel guilty our waitress came back over and gave us the real reason for the guilt trip: Her manager (who just happened to be the hostess as well) would eventually yell at her that night and quite possibly fire her.  I felt bad, especially since she was about to cry, but don't guilt trip me into buying food at an establishment that was priced higher than should be and obviously didn't honor their specials.  (To our waitress, I am very sorry we didn't stay, even your tears couldn't get us to stay.  I hope you still have your job.  If the management fired you for us walking out, that is just bad practice, patrons walk out of establishments for far less than what we walked out for (This shows that the attitudes haven't changed from the show)).\n\nWill I ever go back here willingly, probably not.  I'd return if whomever I was with begged and pleaded to come here.  That would be the only way.",0
1727,"This restaurant was terrible from start to finish. The decor is cool BUT the tables for two are way too close together and there are a bunch of big tables in the middle that are not being used. \nThe drinks were awful - no creativity at all, especially for an $18 martini. \nThe food was barely edible. I ordered the white bean soup which was bland. The egg roll that accompanied it was so greasy and I couldn't taste the veggies inside. My husband's filet was undercooked. The gnocchi was mushy and tasteless. We opted out of dessert. They gave us a little freebie which was a homemade Madeline with Nutella dipping sauce. Not exciting or gourmet at all.\nWhat a disappointing meal!!!",0

1731,"So expensive and unsatisfying.  If it wasn't because my options were limited on Thanksgiving, I would've never given Caffe Boa a chance.  But I was desperate and hungry so Caffe Boa was the first of our string of disappointing dining experiences in Central Arizona.\n\nOk, I've had worse but I've definitely also eaten far better food in my life.  The best part of the meal was the free bread. It was actually very good and the dipping sauces (especially the chipotle one) were tasty.\n\nWe ordered the Shrimp Adriatico ($10) to start.  As far as paid dishes go, the appetizer was the best thing we got.  The sauce was marinara-esque with a tang.  If you don't like acidity, you will not like this. The flatbread was delicious and it's also fun to soak up the sauce with the complimentary regular bread as well. \n\nWe also ordered Lobster Ravioli ($22), Angus Burger ($16), and Voodoo Penne ($8 half portion).   The Lobster Ravioli may be the most overpriced, overrated dish on the menu.  Are you serious?  $22 for 5 tiny ravioli?  I would love to see what a half portion is.  What's worse is that the filling tasted like imitation crab.  It was the worst thing on the table. You would think a burger is a safe bet but nope, not the case either.  I know we didn't ask for well-done but the burger, bun and fries came out beyond well-done.  Everything was charred.  $16 for a burger is more than I'd pay for most \""""gourmet\"""" burgers in LA. Finally, let's talk about the Voodoo Penne.  This was actually an excellent value compared to everything else.  A half portion is more than enough for the average individual for lunch.  At only $8, that's pretty good.  Too bad the pasta tasted very average - kind of like the type of pasta I can make at home in 10 minutes.\n\nIt was 1:30pm on Thanksgiving and there were only 2 other tables of people at the restaurant. You would think that if there are 2 servers for only 3 tables of patrons, the service would be excellent.  Instead, the servers often mysteriously disappeared for 5 or 10 minutes at a time.  My friends did ask for a lot of hot water with lemon and honey.  We appreciate all of the free lemon slices, honey, and bread we received. Unfortunately, that was the highlight of our meal.",0
1732,"RUDE OWNER, BORING FOOD, TOO SPENDY FOR 'BAR-FOOD'\n\nI work and live downtown, yet have never been to this restaurant. Today I checked the Groupon Now! deal site and saw Steve's offering an $8 for $12 Now! Deal. I decided to try something new, and as I only ever get 'to-go' lunch, confirmed this was allowed to use the deal. \n\nCalled in my order ahead, waited the suggested amount of time before heading over, then waited at restaurant for order. Once my order was ready, I was presented with bill for $14.26 ($13 entree + tax). I presented the Groupon worth $12. Server said, \""""I'll have to see if I can use this.\"""" Went to the back area and returned with a female employee. They discussed something I couldn't make out, then server came back to me with bill of $4.26. Before handing him my card, I asked why it was $4.26, instead of $2.26 ($14.26 bill - $12 Groupon = $2.26 balance). Before he could speak, the female employee behind the bar spoke up, rudely and loudly, saying [paraphrased], \""""I always add a tip to to-go's, to give these guys a chance to make money. I assume you would tip them anyway.\"""" I asked her why this wasn't part of the terms, that she is not allowed to force gratuity on a customer when not explicitly stated in the terms. She said, again raising her voice to me unnecessarily, \""""I am the owner and have already told Groupon to change the terms to not allow to-go orders. I don't even have to accept it.\"""" I reminded her that as the customer this is not my issue, but hers with Groupon, and that I am not obligated to pay tip or required to dine-in to redeem this deal, as the deal's terms did not state either. Again, she was extremely rude and loud, saying that the point of the deal was to bring customers in to sit and dine, not to get a to-go. \n\nDeciding it was pointless to attempt to converse such an ignorant individual, I informed her that she lost that opportunity because I would never be back. She continued to speak over me and ignored my attempt at discussing the issue as an adult. \n\nNot sure why she couldn't explain this to me calmly, as a rational 'business owner', but instead allowed the the server to present me with a incorrect bill. Why not personally explain the mistake on the Groupon terms (that they do not allow to-go's on Groupons or that she would request a gratuity included in my charge), and earn a customer, instead of alienating one?. Instead, she successfully removed any chance that I will patron this establishment again. \n\nWith all the other delicious, super-friendly, and locally-owned/runned lunch options in the downtown area, I feel patrons should be aware of this business's practices. Not sure about you, but I would rather NOT be inaccurately billed, berated and fussed at by a restaurant employee during my lunch. Your choice!\n\nOh... and after all that, how did the pasta taste? Eh -- nothing special. Like boiled noodles with canned cream sauce, and two strips of over-cooked chicken. Went to Chipotle instead:)",0

The service was fast and when the waitress brought out the veggies out for the pho noodle; the beans sprout seems to be old that they just give it to us since they don't want to \""""waste\"""" it.  \n\nThis is one reasons why I gave it a low review and the broth was salty that I had to ask for more limes.

1737,"Saw the GRAND OPENING banner and signage while driving to a Yelp event, and decided to grab a quick dinner before heading home.  The restaurant has been opened for years, but due to a kitchen fire, they were closed for 7 months.  So no FTR for this spacious restaurant filled with traditional Thai art and carvings.  Even though the name suggests that it is a Thai restaurant, they also have a significant number of Chinese items on the menu.\n\nThe menu is pretty straightforward.  except it is arranged a little differently from other Thai restaurants (i.e., no curry section). Aside from the usual Appetizers, Salads, Soups sections, the rest of the menu is broken down into sections by proteins (e.g., Poultry, Beef or Pork, Seafood,Vegetables, except you have choice of chicken, beef, pork, seafood or shrimps on just about all of the entree items.\n\nSince I like to order what the restaurant considers their signature dish on my first visit, I was recommended to try Mint Leaf Beef, which is beef marinated in Thai sauce and then cooked with chili and fresh mint leaves.  It was prepared and served quickly,and the flavor was very good.  The medium spicy level is probably less spicy compared to some other restaurant, so if you you prefer more heat you are going to have to specify Thai heat level and not the tamed American heat level.\n\nAmbiance:  3.5/5  Thai themed decor in a spaciously arranged dining room.\n\nService: 4/5  Maybe it was good because they are not that busy, but I have no complaints about their service level.\n\nFood:  4/5  I enjoyed what I ordered, and look forward to trying more items in the future.\n\nPrice:  5/5  Lunch specials are $7.25 which is good.  \n           4/5  Dinner prices is average compared with other Thai restaurants.\n\nLocation:  SW, near the Palms.\n\nParking:  5/5  Plenty of parking spaces in this strip mall.\n\nOverall, 4 stars!",1

I have been on a quest to find amazing pizza in Charlotte, and I can say that this place has the best pizza I've eaten so far.\n\nWhat makes their pizza so amazing, you might ask?  First off, their crust is scrumptious!  It's part whole wheat, and it has a great, chewy texture.  The wheat gives it such a great flavor.  And secondly, they have such a plethora of toppings you can add.  You can get several different types of cheeses, meats, veggies, and even fruit.  I've got to say, that's pretty wicked awesome.  Finally, at certain times of the day, you can get pizza by the slice.  And I'm not just talking about one tiny slice - the slices are giant!  It's like eating a quarter of a large pizza (well, not quite, but you get my point, I hope).  And it's not just some pre-made slice, you can choose what toppings you add to your pizza.  What a stellar idea!  They have several vegetarian options, and they even have a selection of gluten free pizza offerings too!  \n\nBesides pizza, they have appetizers, salads, and even calzones.  They also have a large selection of beers, and apparently you can join their beer club to get rewards.  How awesome is that?\n\nAnd in addition to great food, the decor is all trippin' in there.  They psychedelic theme permeates the tables, walls, and bar area.  They even have an old hippie bus all decorated up, with booths you can sit at in there.  We had great service there, and our server was so enthusiastic.  Their prices are a little higher than other pizza places, but the quality is outstanding.  And if you get pizza by the slice, you can get a large slice with multiple toppings for less than $5.  It's very filling.\n\nOh yes, I will definitely be back here.",1

No wonder premiums are high should they be charged the 200-220 prices. It does pay to shop for prices..",0
1745,"Not quite sure what happened the night we went. Apps came out fine but dinner was a nightmare. There were four of us dining. Two peoples pizza came out about 20 minutes after we finished the apps. It took another 45 minutes after the pizzas came out before my pasta and my wife's chicken Marsala came out. They were very apologetic and actually comped the food part of the bill. It was an unfortunate night. When the food finally did come, it was very good.",0
1746,"Ok, I have been here for lunch during the work week and the service is never great. This time it's Sunday Brunch and 15 minutes for some one to take our order, another 5 minutes for someone to come by and tell me they are out of Grits, then 30 more minutes for them to bring one order, after 20 more minutes we gave up all hope on the rest if the order!!  The BBQ is good but it's not worth the aggravation.",0
1747,"Definitely very entertaining! I had the best original margarita! Service was awesome! Shannen was the best server we had for the week that we stayed in Vegas, and we ate out Everyday!!! Thanks again to the staff and a great show!!! I will definitely be back",1
1748,"Love their plain and Almond croissants.  Triple Chocolate cake was pretty good as well.  Palmier was delicious!   I also had a Nutella brioche.  It was not as good as other pastries that I had tried, so I give them 4 stars.  But over all I love this place:)",1
1749,"A group of 10 of us came here for dinner during the week on a last-minute reservation.  They were very accommodating. Ambience in the dining room is nice but nothing special.\n\nAppetizers: We had crab, oysters and calamari at the table.  I didn't eat the first two (not my thing) but others said crab was good, not mind-blowing.  The calamari was fantastic, no chewiness and cocktail sauce was great.  \n\nMain course:  I had grilled halibut steak, which was absolutely kickass; cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and HUGE. I could barely eat half of it.  Others had parmesan halibut (she loved it) Mahi (he liked it very much) and steak (she loved it). \n\nSides:  Everything here shined.  Roasted corn was BOMB, green beans were perfect, and their signature mashed taters with crunchy topping were great.  Why I don't make my mashed potatoes with a crunchy topping I don't know. \n\nDessert:  we each had a few bites of their tres-leches-like cake (not sure what the actual name was) with a caramel sauce on top which I could've eaten two servings of.  We also tried their key lime pie, which was good, but not out-of-this-world or anything.\n\nOverall, very good experience and I would definitely go back!",1
1750,"What time is it?\n\nThank goodness I didn't have to actually ask an employee here, because I woulda been S-O-L.  \n\nI spent a total of about 30 minutes waiting for help with their made-to-measure shirts program.  That's how long it took me to find someone who felt like taking time away from their busy work or taking story to other employees to give me the time of day...which never happened, so I just lost my patience and gave up.\n\nWhat time is it?  Here's a hint: time to train ALL of your employees on customer service.  Or maybe that's just a waste of time.",0
1751,"I've been to the original Hofbrauhaus and while definitely not the same, this place is still very enjoyable. Huge HB beers, multitudes of sausage, and their wonderful sauerkraut makes me happy. The $9,95 daily lunch specials all looked good as well. Do a Jager shot and they spank you, supposedly. Its a pretty cheap cab ride from the strip and a nice getaway from the constant slot machine clingclongbeepchingdingdings.",1
1752,"Such a cute place with awesome food and service.  \n\nI went here for lunch with my mom and it was a great experience.  We were warmly and enthusiastically greeted, and the boy working was more than happy to fully explain how the menu worked and any item on the menu.  \nWe played some cards while we waited, and every person working there seemed to be upbeat and happy.\nFood was great and there was a TON of it.  So yummy.  I'll be ordering takeout soon I think.",1

1754,"Bought a Groupon and would have loved to use it! I bought the Groupon in April and called pretty frequently the first few weeks and left messages. Someone did eventually call back and left a message (called around 11 AM on a weekday, I was at work so couldn't answer). I called back same day and tried again repeatedly. Never  got another call back. Had to get a refund from Groupon:( Would have loved to have my windows tinting in April or May. Now it's already 120* and I need them down pronto! Looking elsewhere.",0
1755,"Went here to grab a quick dinner before heading back to the room. I wasn't that hungry so I decided to order their sliders. MISTAKE. I know they are sliders but I was expecting them a tad bigger and maybe like 3-4 of them instead of two plain bite size burgers and four potato chips? I ended up spending $20 for it with a soda, tax, and tip. I hate spending money on food and leaving unsatisfied!  The people I went with said their regular burgers (I think they ordered the kobe beef) were the best burgers they ever had so I will definitely come back here again to try one of their regular sized ones. Either that or the salmon burger looked real good too. I want to like this place so maybe next time I try it I will.",0
1756,"Safety first. Gun shots were fired, and the cops blocked off the front entrance. I probably won't be back.\n\nIf you're a daredevil here's more of a review. The place is located off the strip kind of out by its lonesome. It does look like an old mansion, but the decor is okay. Lots of people come here, and space is definitely an issue. You can barely move. I purchased one drink and one shot. The shot was strong, the drink was really weak and was $9. Not really worth it. The music is pretty good. A good hip-hop mix. The crowd is diverse, which was surprising. Make sure you dress to impress! The guys and the girls look really good. Hookah.. I know they have it, but I didn't get it. I guess it's a nice added bonus if you have a table. \n\nHave fun if you go.",0
1757,"I had a customer come in and her nails were banging so I told her I had to know where she had gone so that I could try to get my swag on her level.  To my delight she told me the place was just a few minutes away on Ray and Rural!  Now I'm not the type of girl who goes to the nail salon every week for mani-pedi's but a friend was doing a music video shoot and I was going to be in it so I figured I could expense it at that point...I'm sending him the bill.\n\nWalked in on Friday at around 1:00 and the lobby was pretty full so I debated leaving because I was on my lunch break and while I can get away with a lot I knew that it would probably be frowned upon if I took a 2 hour lunch.  Luckily everyone was helped within minutes of my arrival and they were able to get me right in.  The girl who was in charge of my nail transformation was Natalie and she was awesome.  Suuuuper sweet, call me a sucker for pet names but she kept calling me \""""honey\"""" and I wasn't mad at it.  She actually made conversation too which was nice 'cause I'm not all about that awkward silence you get with most nail experiences.  She did a great job too, my french tip toes are on point and my nails are able to be seen in public again.  I'm going to have to step my game up at work because coming here makes me WANT to be one of those girls who's in the salon every week.",1
1758,"My 2nd visit here in a week.\n\nSo I was there about 12:15pm, and the parking lot was 75% full.  Fortunately I was able to be seated with no waiting, but the place was pretty much full.\n\nThis time, I tried Spicy Shio with extra green onions and gyoza.  \n\nGyoza:  pretty good.  But I would have to give this gyoza battle to Monta.  It's very possible they Sora will get better as they have been open only a week, but Monta's gyoza had more flavor and juice.  \n\nShio ramen:  I'm not a big fan of shio ramen, but I have to admit that this was pretty good.  simple, not oily, with some of the tonkotsu flavor coming through.  Spicy Shio is a weird concept as it makes it somewhat spicier and fattier, which is somewhat like ordering a veggie burger with extra cheese.  I  think I'd stick with Miso personally, but I do like their noodle.  Al dente, slightly chewier than Monta's miso ramen noodle, and wavier.   I think  it is more like a traditional miso ramen noodle from sapporo.  People who are not fond of heavy, kotteri type broth will probably prefer shio ramen.  Not me.  \n\nService:  today they had a one Chinese lady waiting the table, and other two were Japanese.  This is somewhat disappointing for an authentic ramen house, but it's not that big of a deal as the menu is short and simple.  However, the service seemed to be faster today.  Perhaps they are getting used to it after the opening week.  \n\nAs I was leaving, there were a few people waiting to be seated and the parking lot was full.  There is plenty of space to put in a few tables, and I really think that they need a counter space as all authentic ramen houses should have.  I'm just surprised at how quickly the word has spread and so many people have discovered this place.  \n\nIt's hard to say who is better:  monta vs Sora, but I'd go to Monta if I\""""m feeling for tonkotsu, and Sora if I'm in the mood for miso.  \n\nThere are no other Japanese ramen house that come close to these two.  If you disagree, please keep going to the place where you get served by faux anime characters.",1
1759,"I have been to this restaurant a few times.  Every time we were there because we were looking for places to dance (my workout exercise).  Every Saturday night, they have salsa, bachata music for a few hours.  We normally got there early at around 9 pm.  Right, the customers had never been close to ten each time.  I always like to have red wine, desert and snack.\nThe crowd will not come till around midnight when they change the music to reggaeton then you will see hundreds of young people flood into the restaurant.  There were not enough seats for everyone and there was no room to walk thro'.  People are drinking and dancing within the limited place. Doubted if they just love that jostling feel.\nNormally once I see the crowd, we will start to leave.  There are always police around the parking lot.\nOn a Saturday last month, without knowing they called celebration of Columbia night, we went down in a whole family of four as we had children visiting.  Out of my surprise, they charged $15.- per person just to get in.  No drink, no nothing.  It was my friend who did not want to upset the party, he paid for it.  What?  $60.- to just get into the crowd with no seats.  Later he found some friends who gave us a few seats.  Honestly I was not happy at all.\nThe floor is carpet.  Price of the drink is above average.\n\nI talked with many of my friends, everyone said $15.- entrance is outraged.  Even I never have to pay, I still consider not a place for me.  I know they do charge for entrance, check out before you go unless you do not mind.",0
1760,I absolutely love this place. The staff is so nice and it is very clean. I was quickly seated after walking in without an appointment. I thought it was going to be a long wait since there were a lot of people in the salon. However they had lots of staff working so there was not much of a wait at all. \nThis was my first time here and I was very satisfied. I am excited to go back to get my nails done again. I will also refer all my friends and family to come here(:,1
1761,"Get the pasta trio, you won't regret it.  Big heaping portions of fresh pasta delivered to your plate as soon as you have space available. Mmm.  And we went on a Saturday night with no reservations and we're seated in 5 minutes.",1

1763,"So glad there is a new fantastic place in my neighborhood to frequent. Fantastic service, lovely people, delicious things to linger over in the shop or take home, I am so pleased such a place exists! Far more charm/personality and life than across the street at Starbucks...\n\nBrought a friend for lunch and she loved it as well. Also, the BEST baguettes for miles;) Will 100% be a repeat customer!",1
1764,We went in... The hostess and owner were welcoming. The bartender was not. Communication seemed to be lacking. We ended up going around the corner to Delux which has a new Zen32 inspired sushi bar - they even have the same sushi chef (and happy hour) as they did before. Great service - Great Food!!! Interestingly enough we met up with some kids that said they had the same experience we did at Central Bistro. Who knows - maybe they'll get it together.,0
1765,Awful. Walk in confused. We seat ourselves. Sit awkwardly. Wait twenty minutes. Get up. Get the waitress to take our drink order. Wait. The owner asked if we needed anything and we said we need someone to take our order and she said she doesn't handle money and allowed us to wait. Then we complained and she lied and said she came over multiple times. Couldn't get out soon enough.,0

SOOO good! \n\nThe only thing I wish they would do different is play some Korean-pop music or some Korean music. The food is magnificent and the kimchi is delightful. I will definitely come back here whenever I have Korean cravings. Till next time...",1
1767,"went there the other day for the second time, we happened to have coupons for a free burger, I ended up getting the Albacore Tuna sandwich with the sweet potatoe fries. Both were very flavorful and the tarter sauce on the sandwich was awesome. My husband got the Charburger and was equally as tasty. Last visit I got the tri-tip sandwich and was just as pleased. I would HIGHLY recommend it!",1
1768,"Thank you Yelp. Not for introducing me to another good restaurant, but for introducing me to new friends who introduced me to a good restaurant. I tend to not be the most available individual, but Robyn and Kevin L. have been very patient with me. After a few failed get together attempts, we finally met at Frank and Fina's for dinner. \n\nI have had this on my bookmarks for a few months and was happy to try something new. Of course I fell victim to the infamous Sweet Potato Enchiladas ($10.25) and a Margarita on the rocks with salt ($5.75). Two nice size tortilla rolls filled with mashed sweet potatoes caught me off guard with the natural candy like flavor. After a few more bites, I adjusted, and they were delicious. I was also able to taste Robyn's Guacamole and Kevin's Queso Fundido. Both were good. The first might be bland for some, but I could eat a whole guacamole with nothing else, so that did not bother me. The cheese dip was fantastic. Served with soft flour tortillas, you will need more to get all of the melty goodness. It would be a sin to waste any,\n\nIf a good meal is not enough, bring some friends along because it is a chill atmosphere. Throughout dinner, we were checked upon, but it did not interfere with conversation. The quiet setting is perfect for dates or catching up.",1
1769,"Yes, you see it correctly, I just gave Chevy's 5 stars.... Why you ask? Well when i lived in Cali we would meet our friends at Chevy's for the awesome happy hour and have some great margaritas. Since coming to Vegas I thought that there was not any Chevys around anywhere. \nWe ventured over to the mall and guess what I spy?!?!?! CHEVY'S. \n\nI think they have great salsa and I really like the nachos.. I am in no way saying that this is \""""real\"""" Mexican food but it was good and cheap. If I really think about it I am giving this place stars just like how you would give your friends that you have not seen in a long time a high five long before you ask how life has been treating them. So in all reality the food could have been so-so but it was all about the reminiscing.\n\nAnyone want to go get a Margarita... Count me in!",1
1770,"Don't waste your money.  I've had several manicures/pedicures in my lifetime, and the service here was surely the worst. They were rude.  Jenny HURT my foot when she was shaving off the calluses because SHE WAS LOOKING THE OTHER WAY.  Not even paying attention to what she was doing.  That happened twice.  I usually do my gel nails at home, but thought I'd give myself a treat by going here.  Wrong.  I could have done better than Lien.  My fingernails were filed crooked, as were one of my toenails -- if I hadn't noticed and had Jenny straighten it out.  Very unhappy with the service here.  Groupon or not, I will NOT go back.",0
1771,This place was an ordering disaster. No one seemed to know what was going on.  The food was just as good as any other Wendy's.  Don't go here unless you have a lot of patience and time to waste.  The manager did apologize for the wait and stopped by our table to check on us.,0
1772,"Hooters should stick to making wings and even that comes into question. They screwed up my food order both nights I was there. The rooms are old and dingy and feels like your sleeping in the restaurant, and the hallways remind me of old, questionable Bates hotel fronts. Honestly, you would be better off staying at the Motel 6 next door. \n\nThe front desk ladies are rude like they hate working there too but have no choice.  The kicker was they cancelled my room after the 1st night even though I was scheduled for three days ---and already had someone booked before I realized my key card didn't work and had to go back to front desk to remind them I'm still in the room. \n\nSave your time and money and please extinguish all options before choosing to stay here.",0
1773,"I am going to state upfront that I have rated the Genius Bar with 2 stars because the person assisting with getting people appointments, and getting people to their appointments couldn't even make eye contact with us when we were speaking with him to attempt to get an appointment. I guess I realize that you are a genius (supposedly) but this is not the place to play out your brooding. It is a customer service gig..... so I would suggest either getting your head outta the tablet surfing Apple Store internet and get some people skills.\n\nOK, rant complete.

She kinda spoke to me like Help Desk technicians speak to people who shouldn't be using computers that call them with stupid questions like \""""My computer wont come on\""""\nTechnician: Did you turn it on?\nCustomer: Oh.... no I guess I didn't. \nWell, I am not a computer idiot but there are ALOT of things about iPhones that elude me; and many others from what I have googled. So to treat the people that have come to you for your unattainable knowledge (outside of the new hire training course) like rocks isn't very pleasant.\nThank you so much Apple Genius for restoring my iPhone child to its ordinary operating behavior but maybe next time we could get a smile or giggle outta ya?",0

TJ was beyond rude, and then when I spoke to the Club Manager, he apologized for TJ's behavior and said \""""That's just how TJ is.\"""" Um? If you know one of your managers is rude, maybe you should try to correct his behavior... Just a thought! I do NOT recommend this gym!!!\n\nNow that I think about it, maybe it's because we are gay.

1776,"Okay I went WAAAAY out of my way to check out this place after reading the great YELPs about it, and when I saw that Food Network Star Guy Fieri covered it on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives.  Must be FAB, right?   Not so much.  First, the service - if it can be called that - is remarkably apathetic.   When you are standing directly in front of a cashier for 5 minutes or more, and you have to actually say, \""""um, could I order?\"""" before they are aware you are standing there, I think this is a symptom of a service issue.   Second, it just doesn't seem CLEAN in there; our tables were dirty and there is an off smell in the place.   And third, the food was OKAY but not amazing or awesome in any way.  Now for the disclaimer - I'm not totally qualified to judge any restaurant that serves a majority of meat-based dishes because I am vegetarian.   And my date that evening, who does eat meat, liked his.   But yawn on all the things I could eat - boring, greasy, served waaaay too slowly.  And it wasn't even very busy.   So basically I would say I was disappointed and for those of you who live 25 miles from this place like I do, don't waste the gas!!!",0

I'll definitely let you know how that goes.\n\nThanks, D'Lisa!",1
1778,I was not that impressed. I appreciate that they were open 24 hours and they were friendly. However they didn't want to prescribe anything because they wanted me to see my regular vet. So basically I paid $140 bucks for a supplement with the instructions to go to my regular vet in the morning and spend another $140 bucks.\n\nI went there with a cat that couldn't stop sneezing had labored breathing and was showing a third eye. \n\nI was under the impression because they are the backup for my vet and they worked together. They do not work with your vet. They are basically a urgent care. \n\nBy the time I got in there and waited my cat had calmed down so even though they agreed she needs additional antibiotic they sent me home with a supplement. I couldn't even find out what her temp was. If your pet can wait go to your regular vet.,0
1779,"For starters, we waited forever to be seated, was told 20 minutes, not so, 45 minutes later when asking about our seating, and after seeing several people who came in after us being seated, we were told we would be next.  Very frustrating to see another three groups seated before us still.   When the food arrived one meal was missing, the person bringing the food to the table said he would be back with the missing meal, after most of us had eaten about half of our meal the waitress stopped by, she did not even notice that one meal was missing, we had to request she find out what was going on with the missing meal.   After dinner, there was a desert ordered, it didn't come, and didn't come - when the waitress finally came back she was told to forget about the desert and just bring the bill.  When the bill arrived, low and behold we were still charged for the desert.  I have many things that are not good to say about the meal and the service but will leave it at this.  We will not put ourselves through this again and we will not recommend this restaurant to anyone!",0

1782,Good jambalaya and ok chili (the cheese is a slice just plopped on top) and cornbread... Great beer... But that's all I could eat. I have a severe fish allergy and it was that or a few of their salads (nothing with any meat though). Very disappointing that they hadn't thought about cross contamination with allergies. I'll go back for the soup and definitely the beer but it'll only be with friends... Not by myself. And only if other people suggest it. Very disappointing.,0

I am 100% Italian and learned to cook from the best. So as you can see I am VERY particular about my pizza. The sauce and crust were amazing the cheese was perfect. I will never ever eat pizza anywhere else!!!!! I can't wait to try all of there entrees go there ASAP Ciao:),1
1784,"This place is fantastic. I like weird old vinyl, and rarely find anything I'm interested in. Not so at Afterlife. I was interested in most of what they had, bought a few of them. Their antiques seem pretty wacky too. Make no mistake, this is the kind of place you'll love if you have a \""""Keep Madison Weird\"""" bumper sticker. The kind of place that is an endangered species in cities across America. A truly unique shop full of the care and taste of an individual not a corporation, full of truly cool oddball antiques. No insincere simulated Urban Outfitters nostalgia here, just a touching and odd sense of history.\nI bought one of their mystery bags too, and it was great; a self-help book from the 70s called \""""Lovers Who Are Friends,\"""" a mysterious old framed photo, and some other odds & ends.\nGo Nicole! I hope your business thrives. Keep keeping Madison weird!:-)",1

I also get a side of grilled asparagus and it is sooo good! Not only is the food good, but it is just an overall fun atmosphere and I think that's why we end up there a lot of times. The Passion Punch goblet is my favorite, not too sweet, more citrusy. But if you are looking to get a buzz I would recommend getting you're own. When we split one neither one of us feels buzzed at all by the end of it. \n\nFor the most part we have had great service at the bar or a table. However, we did come across one bartender recently that was rather rude.

1788,"While in ahwatukee last night for a music festival, we decided to go try Los Dos as it came recommended and was very close by.  \nWe were greeted right away and were given a half moon booth to squeeze into.  A gal came and took our drink order and our soft drinks came out right away. A house margarita took 15 minutes. Yikes. To say that the service was slow would be an extreme understatement. \nAfter finally getting our margarita, our real server took our food order. I got stacked enchiladas, wifey and daughter each ordered a green corn tamale. Also, a ala carte taco and beef flautas. I asked for a side of honey as I had to cool my mouth from the ridiculously hot green salsa.\n\nHere's where it gets bad, real bad.  The honey comes in this little black ramekin, color is key here. I dipped a few chips in the honey and had succeeded to cool my mouth off, when i saw a small black ant type bug crawling on my hand. I simply squashed it and was about to dip another chip when i saw several dozen ants doing laps around the ramekin.  After killing as many as I could find, I called the server over and told her what was up. She was incredulous that there were any bugs and took the bowl away.\nOh, our food was still MIA after 25 minutes. During that time a manager type came by with the server in tow, and asked the server while standing at our table, \""""Is this the bug guy?\"""" She proceeded to explain that she had personally prepared the honey bowls only an hour prior and that she couldnt believe that there were bugs in the bowls. Thankfully the server had looked into the ramekin when she had taken it back to kitchen and found more and told the manager that there were indeed bugs.  The manager made no offer to comp or toss in a dessert or app, i guess cause our food was still mia.\nOk, i guess we should have left, but we were starving and our food finally came:  My stacked enchiladas was very average, the best thing in the plate was the rice.  The tortillas were so tough, i had to use a knife to cut them. The two green con tamales, well.... i could only tell that it was a tamale because it was served on a corn husk. The cook had chopped it up into some unrecognizable mush that was bland whose only taste came from the overdose of hot peppers.\nThe beef taco was reported to be ok, but again it was so spicy that it took away from the taste. The best food item was the flauta, no one can screw up a deep fried rolled up corn tortilla right??\nTo sum up, over priced, bug infested, super spicy to cover up the lack of taste, very long delays and rude manager. Never to return. I will try and keep as many of my friends from going as well.",0
1789,"I know it's their signature, but still... year-round Christmas decorations are strange.  If you don't know to expect it, you get the sense that they are just lazy about taking them down... 8 months later.  \n\nThe food was just OK, where I didn't find Rao's to be particularly better than the Maggiano's or Buca Di Beppo type places you can find in suburbs across the country.  \n\nNot sure why you'd go out of your way and pay Las Vegas premiums for that...",0
1790,"The worst coffee I have ever had! Poured from a pitcher sitting in the fridge, watered down and coffee grounds?! I had to throw it away after gagging. This should not be served to the public. WARNING don't waste your money!",0
1791,"(8/12/13) I stopped by today to pick up a couple chocolate chip cookies for work. They were nice and fresh. The bakery was full of cookies, cupcakes and cakes. The cookies are $2.00 each but they are almost as big as one's head! I always have a difficult time deciding what to get because everything looks so delicious.",1
1792,"I've made several trips to Indonesia over the years and this is the first place in the States that serves food comparable to the fare I had there..  The food at Bandung is excellent and the service is first rate. Regrettably, I find myself in Madison only two or three times a year.  Otherwise, I'd be a very regular customer.",1
1793,"came here on Saturday 8/2/14 afternoon for some lunch, it was a party of 9 of us. The pace was pretty empty. We were sat and waters were brought, our drink order was taken and they came about 15 minutes later...much too long for the place being empty. A few of our party arrived about 15 minutes after our drinks arrived ($14 for a tiny little mixed drink...ridiculous) and our server had still not gotten back to take our food order or the new arrivals drink order.  We ordered a few appetizers, thank goodness, because our food did not come for another 30 minutes. Our server was kind of a jerk and did not come and check on us. The manager came over one time but all she did was take more drink orders, did not apologize for the long wait or the horrible service. We ordered chips and salsa but the salsa was way too spicy even for me to eat and I love spicy food. The next time we saw the server we had to ask for our bill, we paid with a couple of cards and the rest cash. The server NEVER brought us our change back, by that time we were so fed up we just wanted to leave. I give this place 2 stars only because the ambiance and d\u00e9cor was very nice. The food was not even good the enchiladas were more like 4 mini tacos with sauce on them (it was $18 by the way)....my friends couldn't even eat their salads. Would never recommend this place.",0
1794,"This is an excellent Roberto's.  I've been to others but this on is best.  The staff is very friendly and FAST.  But, the food doesn't taste like fast food, it's fresh and good.  I usually get the carne asada plate which lasts me for three meals!  The salsa verde is excellent.",1
1795,"I will always trust them with any car I drive.  They are trustworthy and honest!   I have been their customer for years, but there is one time that Gab wanted to take a little extra time to ensure he diagnosed the problem correctly and it ended up costing me a lot less money for an extra 30 minutes of time for him to validate the actual issue.",1
1796,"Came twice.\n\nFirst was we saw it and we were hungry driving by and 2nd time we brought my inlaws. \n\nIt's no LA, dim sum but I appreciate that they had dimsum through the day as we night people have to wake up \""""early\"""" to make it to a dimsum cutoff. It was decent both times, though limited...but I would expect so for serving all day. \n\nWe had a few entrees and all we got were very good and where I rate them higher for than the dimsum in terms of taste. I liked that they did a ginger scallion chicken here, but it was crispy chicken instead of steamed...just a different take on a favorite is sometimes nice. Grandma really liked her mongolian beef and it was good- soft meat and not too spicy. Mom in law got lo mein and was happy with it. Got also shrimp walnuts and they were big and fresh. \n\nOverall, not a bad place. Service was decent too and at least I can get a few dimsum dumplings during dinner time. Still- I'm holding my breath on if I'll ever find a place that has amazing dimsum like home.",1
1797,"Confession - I don't tend to shop in Harvey Nics for clothes!\n\nI love the food hall though - Cuckoo's Cakes and good range of special gluten free items like gnocchi and pasta.  \n\nThe beauty dept is fab - a treat is the Nails Inc champagne file and polish. Buy your polish at the same time and get your nails done for \u00a312 which includes a couple of glasses of champagne:-)\n\nStudents also benefit from cheap brows. Show your student card and brows at Shavata are only \u00a310, compared to \u00a317 full price.\n\nSo HN, I don't bother much with the clothes but you are decent for all the extras:-)",1

It's always difficult to find a good service professional. I have found the previous professionals didn't match up to my LA and SF girls. I went through four different estheticians before luckily landing Keli. She's detailed, fast, clean and a total professional. She also uses hard wax is easier on the skin. Almost pain free. I wish I could move her to LA! \n\nSince she's her own boss, her prices are great too. I have finally found someone in Phoenix that I trust for my skin care.",1
1799,Probably one of the nicest afterhours place i've been to for a long long time...not the biggest place but its not all dark and dirty like the other 100000 after hour places....good music...cool vibe..cept not many people really get down on the dance flooor...when i went the ratio wasn't that great either.. oh..if your lucky..you'll get to see one of the nastiest dancer i've seen for a long ass time...he's got this james brown move..and he danced with micheal jackson from 92-95..hahaha i recommend it for sure.,1
1800,We'll organized and great prices! I love that items are clearly priced & displayed neatly. The store was clean and we'll maintained. A slightly funky smell as you entered but it went away or I got used to it LOL huge clothing selection organized by size & color! I wish they had more furniture but it guess that all depends on peoples donation. Plus they have a special color of the day that's 50% off. It's definitely priced cheaper than Goodwill & Savers. Overall good spot to thrift.... Plus great tunes playing while shopping!! Nice Rockin' oldies!,1
1801,"MEH MEH MEH. This place was just meh. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give this place one star was because my guy friend got in here for free so that's +1 for that. Venue wise....this place is SO SMALL! WHERE'S THE DANCEFLOOR?! COME ON!! Then, there are the creepers...my friends and I were people watching and saw a bunch of creepy old guys hitting and checking out these girls. Then, same creepy guys hollered at some of the girls and the girls were not having it. That was pretty funny. Other than that, music was meh - they only started playing the good stuff when we decided to leave, venue - SMALL, pool - SMALL AND CROWDED...overall, DISAPPOINTING!",0
1802,I will never forget Campiti's. As a youngster growing up playing on Potomac Avenue and Dormont. My favorite pizza was and still is Campiti's. I have not found an equal in the 18 years I have been in CA. The hoagies were pretty damn good too.,1
1803,"Even better than the LA location. The sushi is good, not mind blowing, amazingly fresh, OMG....but a solid good. So you get an enjoyable meal, with an intimate dining experience, and great ambiance. Good views of the strip and a little bit of a breather from the chaos. But what made it a fantastic night was the service. It was EXCELLENT. Best restaurant experience we had the entire trip! I will go back next time I'm in Vegas which I hope will be soon!",1
1804,"Sure it's a giant Hershey's store...but there's a lot of interesting things in the store that you don't see in regular stores that sell Hershey's products.\n\nThe setup is similar...VERY similar to the M&M's store across the street (brah, you have a competitor now!), except this store features a bakery and a photo booth instead of a movie screening and...I guess statues where you can take photos with.\n\nEverything in this store is chocolate related, not surprisingly. They even have a Hershey's statue of the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, which is quite chocolate-ly delicious.\n\nEven if you're not planning to buy something in this store, do at least pay a visit here just because it's something Vegas has (many people visit the M&M store across the street for the hell of it, why not here?).",1
1805,"I've been here several times- either to get lunch or to pick up goods to go.  While the baked goods are fine, at each visit, I've been just flat-out shocked by the rudeness of the service.  The kicker is that I called to order a cake, but you know, if you won't even answer the phone professionally, I just don't have it in me anymore to excuse you.  I'll bake it myself...with love.",0
1806,"This post is for anybody who likes pizza but doesn't like be treated like crap. My wife and I ordered Pizza Re pizza a couple of weeks ago and called at 8:50 pm. We asked how late they were open and if they had any specials. They gave us the info we needed and then we told them we'd call back. When we called back at 9:05 pm we were informed that they only take deliveries until 9 pm and that they were not going to deliver to us. We explained that we just called and even told them we'd be calling back. Any person with common sense would say \""""Just to let you know we don't take delivery orders after 9 pm\"""" but they didn't. They reluctantly took our order and delivered the pizza. When we got it home it was great and the sauce is awesome. Now to get to the good part of the review. We just tried to call tonight at 8:58 pm because we knew that they stopped taking deliveries at 9 pm. When we called we were put on hold and then at 9:02 when the person came back on the line we were told that they stop delivering pizzas at 9 pm. I explained that we did call at 9 pm and he said sorry. I told him that we want to give Pizza Re our business and we know how hard it is for a small business to survive, because I run one, and that we made it in under the wire. Again, he stated he didn't care. So I said that I was going to give my business to Little Chicago another local company. I used to deliver pizzas in college and it boggles me that a company stops taking calls at 9 pm when they close at 10 pm. Is Pizza Re too good to take my money? Are they doing so well that they cannot take orders after 9 pm? If this was a real concern then they should advertise on their website that they stop taking orders at 9 pm, but they don't. These questions might go unanswered but one thing I am sure of, I will NEVER call them again. A consumer should not be made to feel bad that we're bothering a business by patronizing them. In this economny local small businesses should be welcoming customers, not driving them away with poor customer service, bad soft skills and workers that don't really care about the customer. I'm sure if the owner answered the phone they would have taken the order. But because the workers at this business care more about closing then making money, I'm sure they'll be closing their doors soon. Just another local business with a great business plan and poor execution. I hope the owner reads this and takes a hard look at the people they have answering the phones. They are the Pizza Re's 1st impression and they are doing a very poor job.",0
1807,"The tables in the bar area are super small, so don't plan on getting much food. It won't fit. The tacos were pretty good, except the veggie one. They are going out of business, so they don't have all of the liquors listed on the menu. Slow service. Ambience is somewhere between modern and college with color changing bar lights.",0
1808,"Cypress Street Marketplace is a food court in the middle of the casino in Caesars Palace. It's very convenient, but I'd highly recommend skipping it as a food option.\n\nThe atmosphere is actually pretty cool, tables in the middle, surrounded by different food vendors. It's very, VERY pricey for what it is though. To give you an example; I ordered a double cheese burger, with fries and a drink for about $23. Now, if the burger was good, I'd have no problem with this place, but, the burger sucked. It really did. It looked GORGEOUS, but tasted like a gas station burger.\n\nFor the price, I'd skip this place, and head on over to one of the many kick-ass restaurants in Caesars or the surrounding hotels.",0
1809,"What a wonderful boutique!  I was visiting AZ over the holiday break from Chicago and my Mom and I made an appointment. I couldn't imagine going dress shopping without my Mom and liked the idea of buying a dress from my hometown as the wedding is going to be in Chicago.  Uptown was my very first stop on my dress shopping journey and I came away with the best time and a magical experience. Sheila was incredible and so helpful.  The shop is so cute and I appreciate her time and patience in finding a beautiful dress for my day.  There were so many choices in the silhouette that I was going for.  Sadly, in the end I didn't end up purchasing from the store but the dress was an extremely close second in the running.  A definite must to check out the store, it was like a dream.",1
1810,This place has a great location and fantastic amenities. The rooms are spacious and you can easily fit many people into a room for a party. \n\nPlace is usually really busy though. Breakfast on the weekends can be madness as everyone in the hotel seemed to get in line for food at once. \n\nPark in the lot behind the hotel not at the hotel because you'll save a good deal of money.,1
1811,"Sunday lunch at Lulu's - after working in Oakland for two years and eating there only during weekdays at lunch, who knew that Lulu's actually has sit-down service during the daytime? I didn't, that's for sure, so I was surprised to see a bit of a line forming near the entrance at 1:30 on a Sunday.\n\nNo problem, as we were seated within a few minutes of our arrival.\n\nNow you don't go to Lulu's for good service. You don't go to Lulu's for the dining \""""experience\"""" that other restaurants offer. You probably don't go expecting an \""""authentic\"""" menu. You go for tasty food, served quickly and hot. \n\nSpicy basil noodles with chicken, on this visit, hit the spot just as they have on every other visit I've made. In fact, I love it so much that I hate to order anything else from the menu because I'm afraid to miss out on the vermicelli noodles steaming with carrots, snow peas, red and green peppers, etc. The sauce is sweet and salty, and could be spicier but I'm afraid to doctor up the plate with the red pepper sauce they have on each table for fear of ruining the dish.\n\nThe crowd is nice on a Sunday, relaxed but not lethargic. Our server was polite, took our orders quickly, and stopped once during our meal to make sure everything was ok. \n\nA word about takeout - I've only ordered it once from Lulu's and it was a remarkable disappointment. The food took forever to come out (30 minutes or so) and the balance of noodles to sauce to veggies and chicken was off because it was prepared in the to-go container rather than on a plate. I learned my lesson and now I'll only dine in.",1
1812,"Absolutely disgusting. After getting deathly ill about 10 minutes after eating the cold crab legs (yes, shouldn't have risked it at a buffet) I had to go lay down and was sick all night. THEN the next day I went to talk to the manager who was SO rude. He asked why I didn't say something that night.... Ummmm because I was so sick I had to bolt! And I NEVER get sick from food. He informed me all he could do was call hotel security and file a report. Complete BS. Don't go here unless you want to be sick from shitty cruise ship like food and then treated poorly.",0
1813,"I stopped at Rohrich Toyota to look at their selection of used vehicles. I was quickly greeted by Paul - who was great! I test drove a Honda Element, which was clean and comfortable to drive, but the brakes on this one needed work - very slow response to stop. Then I looked at a Rav4. The first thing I noticed was dog hair on the interior surfaces. I'm surprised that seemingly simple things like brakes and cleanliness would not have been checked and fixed before putting the vehicles on the lot; my confidence was not inspired. I did like the drive course they used because it included big hills and bumps (sure, try to find a loop in PGH that doesn't!). And Paul was easy going and respectful of my search criteria.",0
1814,"Ok, so I was in a pasta type of mood and decided to try Luce to see if all the hype was legit..........and I'll just say that Luce has been added to my Italiano list:-)  I had the express lunch which includes bread, soup or salad, an entree and a drink for $13 guaranteed in 30 minutes or less.  The soup of the day was lobster bisque, which was super yummy with the bread and my entree was the buttera(tubular pasta, italian sausage, sweet peas and tomato-cream sauce).....double yummy!  Hand clap for Luce, I may just have to check out their sister restaurants too!",1
1815,"I LOVE chipotle. Chipotle is my life. But when I came to this chipotle I was sadly disappointed. One of the ladies who was working the end of the line literally threw everything on the burrito so sloppily and was the most careless wrapper I've ever seen. I know they're always in a rush at chipotle but this chick was moving at the speed of light. She made My friend's burrito and not only did it rip from her carelessness but it was half the size of ours. She ended up asking them to remake it which in they replied \""""you could have just asked for extra.\"""" But we weren't planning to pay double for what we should be getting... Plus the prices rose crazy here. $7.20 for Barbacoa and steak!? Idk if it's just this one or all the other chipotles but it's crazy that the prices jumped so high. \n\nI WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST GOING TO THE ONE IN SAN TAN. \nit's worth the distance they are far better an way more consistent!!",0
1816,I was super excited to see that there was a Serendiptiy in Vegas. This was my first stop before hitting the roulette table. I quickly ordered the 12oz frozen hot chocolate for $10 bucks and what I got tasted like a.......\n\nMOCHA FRAPPUCCINO\n\nWTF???\n\nthis place is totally hyped... I should have gone to starbucks to save time and money!,0
1817,"Nice rooms.  Fun surroundings. Lots of places to be \""""seen.\""""  I really liked the Mandalay Bay Beach, although being on it during Spring Break made this married mama of two feel a tad old.  A cool wave pool, a lazy river and more, you'll have no problem passing the day away here.  \n\nThey even have a concert venue on their beach!  We saw Blues Traveler there on our last night in town and it was a hell of a lot of fun! Imagine a hot Vegas night, watching a great band while standing in the cool waters of Mandalay Bay and participating in the ocassional splash fight! \n\nMandalay Bay also offers some terrific eating and drinking as wella s other musical experiences.  Some I recommend are House of Blues, rumjungle, Red Square, China Grill and the fabulous Aureole!",1
1818,"The store is well organized & pretty quiet when I was there. This place has a good selection of shoes, g-strings, etc. It was my first time in there so I spent a lot of time looking at everything (they have a ton of stuff) & the girl behind the counter was patient and helpful. Probably my new favorite store of this kind.:)",1

1820,"25 years ago, this may have been a great restaurant.  I don't think the menu has changed since then. That may have also been when they prepared the \""""fresh\"""" vegetable boat. While the view was great, it is one that can be found in any of the upscale restaurants on mt Washington.  Unfortunately, they couldn't seat us for the 7:00 reservations that we requested.  Oddly, we were the only ones there at 7:30.  Not a good sign on a Friday night...",0
1821,"Inexpensive, quick, can't believe it's not busier.  They also do catering & even weddings.  Food is good with BlueBell ice cream to boot!!!  Free refills on ice tea, sweet ice tea, or lemonade ($1.99 each).  It's not a fancy place since it has wooden benches so no need to dress up @ all.  You order @ the counter & fill your own drinks so very cost efficient.",1
1822,"No, you're not going to find any taco specials here. But yes, you can get your polished $20 tacos and eat it in a swank dining room. \n\nHate to say it, but my expectations going in were pretty low. The chatter on Javier's was  \""""over-priced\"""" \""""not worth it\"""" \""""underwhelming\"""" \""""not real Mexican food.\"""" How else was I to feel? After eating there not just once but three times, I'm happy to say that Javier's isn't so bad.\n\nMy Mexican friends are gonna kill me, but I actually like the food here! The selection isn't unique. You've got your usual meats, tacos, enchiladas, etc. Ingredients and recipes aren't creative masterpieces but the menu is easy to navigate and won't confuse you. The food tastes cleaner here--which can be expected. Meats and other ingredients are of a higher calibre and it really shows in the flavor. I can vouch for the Carne Tampique\u00f1a and the Cabo Azul. And since everyone's #1 question is \""""is the Carne Asada worth it\""""... No, it isn't. Not to say it isn't delicious but like kobe beef, I'm 99.9% sure its a gimmick to add intrigue. It worked on 2 of my friends so far!\n\nTotal date spot for sure. Its got the expensive, swanky feel without being overdone. The dark woods and leathers add to the luxurious ambiance but still make it warm and comfortable. The bar is under this massive rope chandelier and be sure to check out the world's largest chainsaw sculpture. It's actually pretty cool.\n\nService is up to fine-dining expectations and the bartenders are excellent. They've got a huge selection of tequila bordering the lines of ridiculousness. Some of them go up to $2,000. Of the ones I've tried, I highly recommend the Clase Azul. Sweet, smooth, and relatively reasonably priced at $20. I don't usually get mixed drinks, but they make a mean margarita. They run around $17 (if i remember correctly). I had one with cucumber and lime which was nice & refreshing.",1
1823,The first thing I has to say about this place is that it is NOT Mexican. They need to change the name of this place or something because this is not Mexican at ALL. \nI rally hate this place and about every single person in my Mexican family hated it. \nEvery single one of them agree that it is not Mexican at all. \nTaco Bell would be more Mexican than this. I'm embarrassed of this place. \nI've eaten here 3 times and I hated everything. My parents hate it too and we couldn't even finish our meal. \nI have no idea how anyone could eat here. \nI eat almost anywhere and I hate making bad reviews but this place is just that bad.\nIf people like it then that's fine and all but I can't stand that it's called Mexican.,0
1824,"Can't say enough about this place...it's a must when you are in vegas!  I had the original sandwich and the full montagu, and they were both satisfying and delicious.  Hands down one of the best sandwiches I have ever had.\n\nThe bread is totally different from what I have had before, and it's filling.  Be prepared for long lines, but the great thing is that it is 24 hours, and you can go after a hard-nights worth of partying.\n\nEach sandwich is filled with a good amount of meat and other filings, and you get your money's worth (around $6 per sandwich).  Head over to Fat Tuesday's before and get a drink, and there's your full vegas experience right there.",1
1825,"Service is slow, drinks are nothing to write home about.  I wanted this place to be so much more but it fell short.  \n\nI always want to try to try out coffee and drinks from other locations besides Starbucks, but it seems this place is just missing the mark.",0
1826,"I was lured into this store through the succulent aroma from their smokin' BBQ! I'm not a huge BBQ fan but I do appreciate good BBQ when I crave for it. \n\nIt was hard to decide what to order for the first time since they had so many tasty sounding dishes. Well, I decided to try a little bit of whatever I was feeling and save the left overs for later. \n\nMeat Orders:\n\nSliced Beef Brisket: Wowsers! Meat just rips apart with no effort, mild but evident smokey beefy flavor.. Just smother their bbq sauce and enjoy!\n\nPulled Pork: A mound of thinly shredded pork, doesn't explode with flavor but has a good sublte porky taste to it\n\nPolish Sausage: Plain ol' sausage goodness. comes sliced and doesn't need any sauce to accompany it\n\nSide Orders:\n\nGreen Beans with Bacon: When I saw Bacon I was sold! Goes great with the green beans\n\nBaked Potato Casserole: Its like a Baked potato thats been mashed. Goes hand in hand with any of the meats mentioned above\n\nMacaroni & Cheese: simply a southern comfort side you can't go wrong with\n\n* Their Deli Style PIckles bathed in their jumbo jar aren't bad \nand their Bread/Dinner Rolls are so buttery, a must have!\n\nI like their original bbq sauce but their spicy wasn't bad either. I Defiinitely recommend all of the above mentioned but most of all their Sliced Beef Brisket.. MMMMMMmmmMMMMM!!",1
1827,"Amazing! Great food, great service. We had the stone crab which was amazing! I had a filet mignon which was cooked perfectly. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't feel like a nice fine dining atmosphere. Two thumbs up. Get the stone crab!",1
1828,"Staff was very friendly. But food and drinks were disappointing. This place markets itself as \""""Martini specialists\"""" but I had to ask for my martini to be remade a second time as it came without olives. Also - olives were standard jarred fair.

1829,"La Distillerie has a great atmosphere and crowd for your 20-something's who like to get their hipster drank on.  From the cool and attractive waitstaff to the unique and inspiring cocktails, La Distillerie is sure to give you and your friends plenty to talk about when you get there. \n\nThe menu has Le Freshest Design with a simple and informational style that not only explains the alcohol content level of each drink, but also the categorical flavor cohort that it can be shoved into.  From sweet and acidic to herbal, there are both classic and modern favors for you to choose from. \n\nThe only con that I had here was the time it took both to get the attention of a waiter and to finally get the drink I ordered. Other than that I loved it. Will definitely being going back to try more~~\n\nOn a side note there was one particular guy waiter who was hot-as-fux with some of the most lick-able eyebrows I have ever seen....and let's not forget about that female bartender with blonde dreads who double fisted those drink mixers and pounded that ice with that hammer like she was Thor. That definitely had me feelin some type of way.",1
1830,"A jaw-dropping production. Stunning everything: from makeup, to the infamous rotating stage, to the music. One of their absolute classics. I do need to ad that I have seen K\u00c0 in February 2013 (before the accident), so the ending I have seen was the original one and, therefore, from what I am reading, the one that made more sense and was more climactic. \n\nBonus:\nIf you want to follow what's going on better, read-up about the story before you come see the show. \nIn my opinion, center-and-a-little-back seating is the best to view more of the show from, but the beautiful thing about K\u00c0 (the production and theater) is that the show is going on all around you from the moment you step into the theater. There is not a dull moment or person there. \n\nCirque provides a very atmospheric backdrop. It is an immersive experience unlike anything I attended before. It was not my first Cirque du Soleil show, but, so far, the best and the most impressive.",1
1831,"Very happy with this salon... Was looking for a new stylist in Vegas and Allison was awesome. Came last week for a basic haircut and blow dry and loved her right away. She took the time to explain which Bumble and Bumble products to use on my hair and even showed me how to style it the way I wanted-- tousled and textured. While we were going through my \""""hair inspiration\"""" Pinterest board on my phone, we realized color would be fun (I'd never ever colored my hair before) and I'd been considering it for a while.

1832,"Totally Unbelievable......A healthcare company charging $100 to deliver a part especially being that your traveling and have been a customer for several years. They should do the right thing and deliver it for no charge. I called them to see if I could get them to waive the fee I was sure I would be able to get that accomplished and spoke to the branch manager and she was less than helpful and almost downright rude. Kept saying I am not trying to be difficult, oh yeah well than do the right thing and make it happen. Especially for someone who has been a customer for years. We never pay for delivery in Phoenix. She said the only thing we could do is pay the delivery charge or someone would need to come down to pick it up before 5. She had the odasity to say something like if it is that important to you, you should pay the $100......totally disgusting way to do business.",0
1833,"I think I kind of hated this place. Maybe hate's too strong a word. My sandwich was blah. The flavors were bland and the texture was wet and overly soggy for a panini. I got the Sausalito and I tried the Seafood Chowder and Bastille from my girlfriend's plate. I think the prices are reasonable there is potential for a good sandwich, but I just didn't experience it this time. I don't think I'll be back.",0
1834,"Stopped in for a pedi after work, was lured by their 50% off banner. Got say the worst pedi I've ever gotten! \n\nThe water was cold, the lady didn't massage my feet. I guess you can say she applied lotion at the very least. Although I had to rub it in, and to add to it my polish chipped in just 4 days!",0
1835,"Big plus: the baggage claim is RIGHT next to the rental car stations. WELL DONE MADISON. \n\nBig minus: you have to walk to a giant, hard-to-navigate parking lot to find your car/rental company.

1836,Best wings ever! Love how they treat customers. Always great service expecially from the bartender. Never keeps us waiting and always on top of things. Waitresses are amazing and go out of their way just to put on the game you wanna see. Def highly recommend and if you go on the discounted wing days shoot your really getting a good deal!,1
1837,"Horrible experience.  Went there with my father over Labor Day.  When we arrived the line was very long, but moving so we decided to get in.  At first the line crept along, but at least it moved.  Then it slowed down. Then it slowed down to a stop.  We had already paid so we were stuck.  We saw MANY open tables and numerous hostesses talking amougnst themselves about what to do, but not actually doing anything like actually seating the customers.  It took over 1 1/2 hours from getting in line to getting to our table.  And remember there were many, many open tables so there was more than enough seating.  Just not enough customer service.  No food, especially at an expensive buffet such as this, is worth that wait.  Will never go back.",0
1838,"What a whirlwind of a place.  I took the time to print and fill out the new patient forms from their website, only to find out the forms are current.  Awesome waste of my time.  The doctor spoke in medical terms I didn't understand, I had to keep asking her what she meant.  There are so many people coming and going, a literal turnstile of a place.  Which wouldn't be bad if it didn't feel like a turnstile of a place.  And the entrance door could use a treatment of WD-40.  That door open and closed dozens of times while I was in the waiting room - so loud and creaky.  Speaking of waiting.  I wasn't seen by the doctor until 45 minutes after my appointment time.",0
1839,"I visited RA for the first time last week after a long day of shopping at Fashion Show and it was fantastic!  Got a whole array of different rolls to split amongst the group.  We kept it pretty simple with spicy tuna rolls, yellowtail and scallion rolls, philadelphia rolls and the crispy tuna rolls.  Delicious and super fresh fish!\n\nAlso, the sake bombs were really great here.  The prices were very reasonable and we even convinced the table next to us to join us in the fun.\n\nThe decor is clean and modern and the waitstaff is friendly and doesn't rush you to get out (even when's there's a line of people waiting).",1
1840,"I am picky about frozen yogurt places.  I cannot find one as good as Yogurtland which I visited in Colorado.  Orange Leaf has nice people working there but if you ask to sample something they actually fill the little sample cup for you and stand right next to you when you eat it.  It is uncomfortable.  One of the best things about going to a yogurt place like this one is to try all the great flavors.  It was awkward to say the least and out of 6 different frozen yogurt places I have tried this is the only one I have ever felt awkward in.  The frozen yogurt and topping selection are up there with most in the Madison, WI area but not as good as Yogurtland.  The prices aren't too bad either compared to others, I think a little less even.  For overall experience I would go to Cherry Berry in the area.",0
1841,"Went here tonight for dinner. We have come here often because it is convenient, however, it seems as if the quality has diminished.  We think they switched the type of mozzerella that they use, maybe we are wrong, but the flavor of the cheese isn't as good. Also, we ordered a pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. The mushrooms were canned. I appreciated that they put extra sauce on the pizza as I asked, however, we ordered Rosati's crust (a thicker crust although not Chicago style) they gave us thin crust. Which we took in stride because it is healthier, if there is such a thing with pizza, but not what we ordered. Also, took the server a long time to bring our initial drinks. Although, she was pleasant and did check on us several times. We would have appreciated clean plates between salad and pizza, however, she didn't offer to bring us out any clean plates so that was a negative.  So ultimately I would only return here since it is convenient however, if I have time or motivation I would gladly drive farther for a higher quality product.\n\nI must say that ultimately I teetered between giving this restaurant a 2 or a 3 star but between the diminished quality and somewhat lacking service I opted for the two. If it was just the pizza I might place it at a three.",0
1842,Got my first massage today here and I was a little nervous because of the mixed reviews. With that being said my first visit was really good. My massage therapist was Sara. She did a great job. She used just the right amount of pressure. Not to lite and not too much. She has very strong hands and I could tell if I wanted a more deep tissue massage she could do it with no problem. Yes they do try to get you to sign up for a membership but I didn't feel any pressure. I said no and that was that. The place is very clean and very professional looking. Their was a good amount of people coming in and out so it is a busy location. I don't know if they accept walk ins. I would recommend making an appointment. I'm definitely going back.,1
1843,"My wife and I lived at Avanti from October of 2011 until July of 2013.  In those 21 months, we enjoyed our time there.  They have a great pool/BBQ area, and the 1 bedroom apartment was all we needed at the time.  They were pretty efficient about getting things fixed, and for the price of $725/mo, we really couldn't beat it.\n\n\nAll that being said, I just got done with my move out/check out process...\n\nWe moved into a house about a month before our lease at the apartment was up.  Because of this, I had the power to the apartment cut when we no longer lived there.  This being the case, it would have been difficult for me to vacuum after we moved everything out.  So, I specifically asked how the cleaning fees were assessed after the move out so I could understand what I really needed to clean.  I was told, \""""We don't really charge for cleaning after move out, just major damages.\""""  Great.  Had I known that they would charge me $50 for extra cleaning ($25 for cleaning, and $25 for a TRASH BAG), I would have ran an extension cord from outside to vacuum the inside.  When I explained to Avanti what I had been told earlier, and informed them of how I would have vacuumed if they had explained their policy when I inquired about it, they replied, \""""It's in your lease.\""""\n\n\nBEWARE IF YOU OWN PETS!!!\n\nWe owned one small, house-trained dog, and when we moved in, we paid a $250 non-refundable pet FEE.  Fine. The pet DEPOSIT (which is an additional $250) was waived because of a move-in special.  However, because they waived the initial deposit, they charged us $120 for \""""pet cleaning\"""" upon move out.  Once again, had I known that, I would have made sure the carpets looked pristine.  This is not to mention the \""""pet RENT\"""" that we paid every month ($25/mo PER PET for 21 months = Another $525 in pet fees for us).  So if you're not prepared to get triple-charged for your pets and pay a total of $895 or more to have your pet(s) live with you at Avanti, you may want to consider a more \""""pet-friendly\"""" apartment.  \n\n\nI didn't argue the extra damage fees they charged us at move-out because I didn't take pictures of the entire apartment to prove otherwise...\n\n\nAn overall good experience at this apartment was completely tarnished by the fact that they really screwed us after we were done living there, and really didn't care. \n\n\nI guess this review mirrors the others that have been posted:\nGood apartment complex, piss poor management.",0
1844,"Love this place!  My little chi, Moe, has been going there for the past month or so and it's been wonderful.  I love that when I call to schedule him for day camp or boarding they immediately know which dog he is and express their excitement that he'll be coming.  Moe has some attachment issues and likes to be near people constantly and they're fine with that.  In fact, they even seem to love it rather than being annoyed by it.  I love that they do the initial temperament test to make sure he'll do well there and that they have webcams running 24/7 that I can view on my phone.  The fact that he can run free and play (or climb in a lap!) all day is great!  I also really like that he's with dogs of all sizes and not separated into groups based on size like so many other facilities.  The report cards that are sent promptly at the end of each day and the pics on Facebook are all extra perks offered at Villa La Paws that make the experience of trusting them with your dog even easier.",1
1845,"If you like excellent food, great beer on tap and all on the cheap- this is it. \n\nI love this place- I usually go with Lamb Vindaloo so I can get a little spice in my life and one of their amazing beers to wash it down. When that warm pocket of goodness arrives at your table, you know you made the right choice for your meal. You can even take one to go and finish cooking your pasty at home. \n\nAll in all, this is a go to for me and my friends and you won't be disappointed if you work this place into your rotation either!",1
1846,"First off the food was ok. Just ok. One of our diners had the ribeye Oscar style and it was so tough he didn't even finish half of it. What a waste. Looked dry from where I sat. Hubby had Etouffee and he liked it but had better elsewhere.  We all had Caesar salads, very tasty and the only dressing not made in-house. I had the Shrimp Brochette Appetizer with a salad for dinner, the shrimp with bacon could have cooked a little longer so all meats could cook through. Had a stomach problem later that evening. Bread Pudding, good, Beinget too doughy and overly powdered with sugar.  Nothing spicy, though I thought the Etouffee would be.\n\nService, well we had a reservation and the hostess wanted to seat us at the first table as you walked in to the main dining room when most all tables at that time were empty.  We asked for another table and she really didn't want to move us any further than the table next to it because as she said, later reservations were planned for those tables. Why in the world would you seat people at the first table everyone has to walk by when there were available tables the same size further in?  Our waiter and his assistant were good! \n\nFriends have been here and loved it.  Not sure if there's been a change somewhere down the line. We probably won't be back.",0
1847,"What a dreadul experience.  I had reserved and prepaid via Hotwire but all these folks do is PUSH PUSH PUSH for extras and more money.  I could hear it all around me. My agent took the cake (think her name was Angela).  I was in Phoenix for a little over a day, and was running late (good old USAirways, landed early but the gate was not free and we were stuck on the runway for almost an hour) for a tight business deadline.\n\nWould I like an upgrade - \""""we have a really nice BMW for you\"""" - how much is that? An extra $99 per day on top of what I had paid - no thanks.  Well I can get you something more comfortable, or fun like a Jeep Wrangler.  NO thanks, I just want what I paid for.  How about an SUV - No thanks.  I just want the car I reserved (mid-size).  Well sorry - it will be a long wait - the ONLY car available (I was in a hurry) was the darned Wrangler (noisy POS that I totally did NOT want but she was determined to put me in) and then talked me into insurance before she would let me go - with taxes etc $85 for 28 hours.  Never again - I guess I'll book directly with Avis next time in Phoenix.  I never want to use Budget there again.  Thanks Angela",0
1848,"Sadly this place has gone downhill since my last visit.Quite simply there is a lack of management and expediting in the kitchen. Also they are skimping; for example fewer ingredients in an omelette. Sadly, they are no longer competitive with other venues. The patio is very pleasant. Their pancakes used to be great; now they are hardly  edible .",0
1849,"I've had margaritas at hundreds of restaurants, and the house margarita at Garcia's was by far the WORST one I've ever had.  So bad, in fact, that I didn't even finish it.....and that's never happened before.  It tasted more like a lime popsicle....that supposedly had tequila in it.\n\nThe spinach queso was good, as well as the chips.  Salsa was mild.....bland.  It took our waiter well over 5 minutes to take our drink order, but service improved after that.\n\nAll in all, probably won't be going back.",0

To me it was a good sign, He must love to the food to eat so damn much of it. Looked around a big, they had PRIME RIB, whoa, Honey roasted ham, pasta, eggs benedict, fresh baked goods, salmon,  sushi, snow crabs. i mean, if you actually got one plate of this in a 5 star resturant you looking between 80 bucks a person. I liked just about every thing. they even got Ojwu to dip the prime rib in.\n\nthey said its the best buffet in vegas, i believe them.\n\nate so much that day, i was done with buffet, the whole week.",1
1851,"We drive into Vegas from the CA side several times a year. We always make one of our stops Green Valley. I know that they are now part of the station casinos but this is one of our favorite ones. Very clean, nice decor, not smokey and they have my fave place in the food court, Coffee bean and tea leaf.\nI love going off strip for buffets because they all serve Pepsi where the strip is strictly coke products. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.",1
1852,"5 star review baby! My husband and I came here at the recommendation of friends who are fellow foodies. We were not disappointed!\n\nWe had the following dishes:\nShiromi Carpaccio\nYellowtail Ceviche\nSeabass and Mushroom\nPanko Fried Soft Shell Crab Sandwich\nPork Belly Buns\n\nThe Shiromi Carpaccio was basically a white fish with they poured this heavenly hot sesame oil with ginger yuzo and garlic all over the fish just before serving. The sesame oil lightly cooked the fish and it was sublime. It was served with homemade focaccia bread and we liked the focaccia bread so much we ordered more so we could dip it into the sauce. The Yellowtail Ceviche was served in Asian style spoons with sesame seed and shredded taro on top. It was a mouthful of flavorful goodness! The shredded taro was crispy and this added a nice texture. The Seabass and Mushrooms was unlike anything I've ever had before. It was baked in parchment paper with garlic butter, sake, and soy. The seabass was very very tender and almost melted in my mouth. The mushrooms were just succulent. I would say the Shiromi Carpaccio, the Yellowtail Ceviche, and the Seabass and Mushrooms were my favorite dishes. \n\nThe Panko Fried Soft Shell Crab Sandwich was very good with housemade focaccia and kanzuri aioli. It all tasted very fresh. It was very filling and I really liked the crunchy texture of the crab. The Pork Belly Buns with braised pork belly, pickled mustard greens were tasty and also very filling. I loved the chewy flavorful goodness of the pork belly. \n\nMy husband and I ordered 5 things and we honestly couldn't finish everything. We were so full and happy! I also had a very good flower tea that I enjoyed. My husband ordered a beer that he had never heard of and enjoyed it immensely. \n\nThe atmosphere is quaint. Nobuo is intimate and quiet in a little old house and you can tell they put a lot of thought into the decor. It's the perfect place for a date. \n\nI was quite impressed with both the food and the service and the chef even came out of the kitchen to shake our hands and say hello. I would highly recommend Nobuo if you are looking for an upscale, quiet meal, with awesome food and service. I hardly ever come to Phoenix because I'm from Cali but I will make a point of coming back to Nobuo whenever I get a chance!! Definitely go for the Shiromi Carpaccio, the Yellowtail Ceviche, and the Seabass and Mushrooms!",1
1853,"Most expensive frozen pizza ever ordered.\n\nThe order taker was friendly, the driver was friendly. Took a little longer than expected to get the delivery. \n\nDidn't look or taste like a hand-tossed, freshly made dough.

Not sure what they got compared to what was delivered to me.",0
1854,So after a not pleasing meal at another Tapas restaurant I decided to go and get some real Spanish food.  Unfortunately I was somewhat filled up so I didn't get to enjoy much of the food but I sure took in some wine =).  \n\nI started with a glass of Vino Verde Sangria ~ White wine Sangria it was very good had plenty of fruit and I ended up having 3 glasses before the night was over.  I also tried Kalimotxo ~ Basque red wine and cola.  It sounded really odd to me so I had to try it and actually it was surprisingly very good.  \n\nFor food I had the Pimiento de Piquillo con Centollo ~ Crab stuffed peppers in a saffron sauce.  There were two peppers in a great flavored sauce and they were full of crab and flavor.  Also there were really good rolls with a garlic aoili that was good.  \n\nFor dessert I had Pastel de Pan ~ Banana & Apple Bread Pudding.  It wasn't a traditional bread pudding more like a soft bread cake with ice cream.  It was also very good and at this point I was extrememly full.  \n\nOverall a great restaurant and I will for sure be back to try more of the menu when I have a bigger appetite but a great first experience none the less.,1
1855,"Had a great breakfast of chicken, gravy, and biscuits with 2 over easy eggs buried under the chicken. Very tasty and not greasy at all. My friend had a mushroom omelet which she said was very good. \n\nGood coffee. Very busy early (before 10 AM) on Sunday and there was a 30 minute wait, but good, prompt service once we were seated",1
1856,"I'm not sure why this place has such stellar Yelp ratings. I assume these reviews were crafted by those who aren't foodies.\n\nThe food here is not good PERIOD. \nI ordered the mussels Moules Hamburg and the mussels Portuguese Style. They were both disgusting. First of all they use previously frozen mussels on the half shell so they don't exactly source the freshest ingredients. The mussels were tough and over cooked. I was picturing a light broth that was just enough to dip you bread in while you could still taste the ocean and the flavor of the mussels. This is not what I got. I got mussels that were drowning in broth. I literally had to go fishing for my mussels since they were completely submerged in broth. The Hamburg style had no mushrooms as the waiter stated and the Portuguese style had no chorizo. The Portuguese style was nearly inedible as there was some off putting bitter aftertaste to the broth. \nI also ordered the stuffed mushrooms wrapped in prosciutto. These were sad and not good. The mushrooms were no joke the size of a nickel and stuffed with pesto rice. Then they were wrapped in prosciutto and broiled. This was an epic fail as the prosciutto was dry over cooked and burnt. \n\nService here was also a disappointment. The \""""dining room\"""" was very small with about 6 tables that face an open galley style kitchen. The kitchen is tiny, unkept, and in my mind better left unseen. It's not like Thomas Keller is manning the stoves. \n\nMy waiter wasn't the best in the business either.  He didn't know the specials of the day, he never refilled my water and he even brought me the wrong check.\n\nIn summary, don't eat here. Take you hard earned cash elsewhere.",0
1857,"You'd think if they are going to charge folks around $16 for a simple tuna melt and onion rings, the service would be awesome.  Not the case. My fiance ordered a tuna melt and then decided he wanted to switch his side order to onion rings.  It took us more than 10 minutes and multiple requests to the hostess, bussers and other service to get the waitress to come by.  We asked for the switch and were told she had to see how far along the meal was.  Ridiculous.  It's pretty easy to switch macaroni salad to onion rings at any stage of preparation.  The food took a little while to arrive and when it did, they had not switched the side.  This took another 10 minutes or so to accomplish, causing the food to get cold.  Meanwhile, I asked for a side of ranch dressing and mustard, which also took multiple requests and about 15 minutes, so my food got cold too.  My water glass became empty as I ate and was not refilled until long after I was finished, even though I specifically asked a server for more water.  Our waitress never stopped by to check on us during the meal, and when she finally showed up she brought the check without offering coffee or dessert.  Meanwhile, I had already gotten up to ask to speak to a manager, who never came.  Only after I asked the waitress for a manager did she come.  The manager was nice and comp-ed our meal, which was the right thing to do.  Kudos to her for her professionalism.  Too bad it didn't extend to providing good service throughout the meal.  Food was just average - certainly not worth the inflated Vegas price.  This was a miserable experience certainly not worth it for a standard tuna melt.",0
1858,"Meh. The positives of this review are limited: every employee I came into contact with was friendly and helpful, and the selection of items like carabineers, outdoor gear, and survival tools is better than average. And so ends the positives of this review.\n\n \n\nThe reality:\n\n) Men's apparel sizes are limited to S, M, L, and maybe once in a while XL. I require XXL, and I found two items of apparel that actually fit me: 1) a stupid madras-flannel made in India button down shirt that looked hideous 2) a pullover sweatshirt that was almost too small for being an XXL. Cargo pants were idiotic in their manufacture, resembling lingerie in texture as the material used was almost nylon-tent instead of cotton, and with virtually no breathing room in the crotch and skin-tight calves. Again, mostly sizes for young boys, not real men. Prices were outrageously high, even for the simplest t-shirts (of which there were no t-shirts in my size).\n\n) A $20 loyalty card program where you pay $20 and get $20 off your purchase and probably discounts thereafter. Really? Yeah, um, for me not so much.\n\n) This store is conveniently located next to parking and restaurants but nowhere near tourist-populated areas. So, if you are local, have a  (lot) of money to spend and don't need anything above a Large and have a waist size under 32, you'll really enjoy shopping here! Fail.",0
1859,"My husband and I have been here many many times and usually meet up with old friends for a few drinks at least two to three times a month. We like that it is a small dive bar and located near out house. However there have been many disappointing visits. The wait staff is NOT friendly or inviting. One blonde waitress in particular is extremely rude. We patiently waited for her to come take drink orders and/or bring a menu, finally we just flagged her down  for a menu. She seemed irritated and threw the three  menus on our table. My husband asked the bartender about the special $2 shot which is posted on the wall. He ordered three $2 shots for then when we received our tab he charged us full price. When we asked about the price it the blonde, rude waitress started yelling at us and said she doesn't care what is posted on the wall she's not giving us the $2 special. We have given this place many chances and every time we are disappointing. we decided this place was NOT worth our money nor our time. Skip it and try another bar.",0

1863,"Fried pickles were okay but portion was small.    Seriously?   Pickles cost next to nothing.   That didn't bode well for the rest of the meal.  Wings came out fast, but most of them were dry and over cooked.   one flavor were cold to the touch on the ends which was strange perhaps suggesting they were frozen before being fried.  They served only drums which was a positive.   The French fries were standard frozen fair.   Why not serve fresh cut you could be proud of?  The blue cheese dressing was homemade and excellent.  Top to bottom it seems like this establishment is skimping on the quality of its food to make ends meet which is a bad business choice.",0
1864,"The food was pretty good, but the place was filthy and the wait staff was beyond confused.  We ordered Korean BBQ, but instead of the normal metal grate over the flame they offered us a thick glass dish to cook our meats.  This worked less than okay, resulting in longer than normal cook times and much greasier meat.  Furthermore, obtaining water refills was quite a challenge.\n\nLater in the evening when we attempted to use the restroom, it was in poor repair, as well as poor cleanliness.",0

For pizza, we order two personal sized pizzas and that feeds four people with a little extra for who is really hungry.  That would be me AGAIN.  This pizza goes down easy.  It's great tasting pizza with delicious sauce, fresh toppings, and thin crusts that do not leave you bloated with dough.\n\nThe wait staff remembers my family and we are greeted when we enter and throughout the course of our dinner.  A past waiter will always drop by to say hello.  The wait staff are very attentive and are true professionals.\n\nThis Grimaldi's location is in the new Park West shopping center.  Check it out.

I agree with previous reviewer to not purchase orchestra seats.  There are lots of aerial acts that are best seen from the balcony, and one act in particular I don't think you would be able to see at all from the orchestra.  All in all, well worth the money for an amazing show.",1

Then when we got our food, the soup was cold, he took them screaming to the kitchen,  Soup cold again, We received it back microwave hot, and our spoons almost burning us that where still in the soup. The meal was salty rice blane, and very little meat in each one of our meals, that where already price highter than usually for lunch time menu.

1873,"10 minutes at our table with no acknowledgement from the wait staff - not even an \""""i'll be with you in a moment\"""". One of those experiences that will never be repeated - at least not at this place since we won't be back. Major fail on a basic of the business.",0
1874,"ok ok, let me get this out here.  this place is actually kind of cool and chill.  it's a nice mix of off strip clubbing if you don't want to mess with the ridiculous crowds of tao, pure, etc...\n\nmusic is good, parking easy, drinks moderately priced.  slightly a bit higher than most off strip locales, but somewhat justified with the ambiance you get in the place.\n\nso why 2 stars you ask?  becasue to date, i've never seen more than 10 people in here.  even on like a friday and saturday night.  we walk in last night to have the 2nd part of a combined birthday party here, and low and behold they decide they want to start charing $5 dollar cover.  now i KNOW 5 dollars is not a massive amount of money, but the two cardinal rules of a vegas local:\n\n1.  never pay to get into a club because you know better\n2.  never wait to get into a club because you know better\n\nforbes, as much as i like your establishment, you CANNOT justify a cover charge.  your crowds in there are 90% local crowd, and if we didn't want to mess with covers we would just go somewhere on the strip...you are already hurting for business as its always dead in there every single time i walk in, what genuis on your management team decided that charging cover would be a good idea all of a sudden.\n\n\ncheck out forbes if they're not charging to get in.  if they do charge cover, go elsewhere it's definitely not worth a cover charge.",0
1875,"What I like about this gym:\nIt's close to home and there are hardly any people in the morning. I prefer to go in the mornings if my shift at work permits because there is no wait for the machines or weights.\n\nWhat I dislike about this gym:\nIf I can't go to gym in the mornings I have to go in the evening, which I dread. The gym is super packed.  The weights are never re-racked. You always have to find a dumbbell when you need it. So f*cken annoying. You have to watch where you step also because weights are just left on the floor everywhere. I am surprised if anyone has not tripped or fallen over these weights. SAFETY HAZARD. Management needs to enforce this more.",0
1876,"First off, this place was remodeled, changed its food, and changed its name to \""""Riv Buffet\"""" several months ago.  Given all the terrible reviews, I was a little nervous about coming here, but a friend said it's fine for breakfast, and I now agree.  I had the regular breakfast buffet this morning.  On the weekends there is a special brunch buffet but that doesn't start until 10am.  The buffet was way more than what I'm used to at a hotel breakfast.  There were made-to-order omelets, two potato dishes, three meats, lots of fresh fruit, cereal, coffee, juices, donuts, pastries (I was really tempted to try the chocolate croissant but didn't), biscuits-and-gravy, chicken fried steak, grits, oatmeal, waffles, and probably other American breakfast items I didn't notice.  In addition, there were a few Asian items, including rice, congee (two types - with or without thousand-year-egg), and kimchi.\n\nI had fruit, tator tots, coffee, a donut, a piece of ham, and a bowl of congee (with scallions and cilantro).  I'm tempted to try it again tomorrow just to get more congee, since I liked it so much.",1

1878,"Terrible service. Management is terrible to say the least. We got to our room and it was 80 degrees. A maintenance gentleman came to our room and had to make some repairs. We explained the situation to Darrin (front desk manager) and he refused to comp the night even though we slept in 80+ degree weather! Little does he know we review hotel rooms for a living...the BAR will definitely be hearing about this as well as his boss, Gary Austin. Don't stay here!",0
1879,"I've been coming to this location for two reasons, good service, and entertainment from the bus stop outside.  However, recently, I've experienced not so great service.

I got a hard shell taco w/ chicken, cheese, and lettuce in it.   Bean and cheese burrito....I got a beef and cheese burrito. Maybe it's my east coast accent? I don't know.   Yesterday, cheesy gordita crunch with chicken. I got a gordita with chicken and cheese. Um hi, either you don't carry that one anymore, or the person reading the recipe does not know what they're doing?  Hard shell chicken taco encased by a soft shell tortilla w/ cheese between the two shells.  What is the issue?  I'm going to try another location until these workers move on to the next job.",0

We had to get back to work and after waiting an hour for all our food to be served, we didnt even get to eat it there.

1884,"Epitome of mediocre. Environment is fun and friendly and the staff is happy and welcoming, but all that aside the food leaves much to be desired. Its fair to mention that everything is no more than two dollars but still doubling the price and quality would not offend anyone I assure you. They offer such wide selections as crab, avocado and rice, rice crab and avocado as well as avocado rice and crab. Overall a neat idea but doesnt make this place a destination, simply a place to get cheap imitation fish.",0

1886,"First, Giant Eagle is convenient. It open early and closes late on a daily basis. I have yet to find another store that sells the same variation of food in a unitary complex. And despite its size, the supermarket is clean, and the employees are knowledgeable on the status and location of most items.\n\nSecond, the prices for non-produce items are competitive if not better than nearby competing stores. The produce items tend to be more expensive, but, to be fair, nearly all if it is fresh.\n\nThird, Giant Eagle offers a brand guarantee and a return policy which assure customer satisfaction; that is, you can return items you are dissatisfied with. Obviously, this is a technical component that is rarely considered when food shopping or dining; however, it is nice to know that the company has a firm faith in the products it sells.",1
1887,"Our office dines out regularly for lunch and this place is on our weekly rotation.  The staff is stable and already knows our orders by memory and we love that.  They are very friendly and I have never found them hard to understand.  The manager always makes his rounds to see how the food was today and is very pleasant.  I did notice that when Tanger Outlets opened they had to hire additional staff almost overnight who were not as familiar with the menu as the other waitresses.  The food is always reliable and the sauces are to die for.  The flaming cheese is really cool and so is the hummus appetizer.  The pizza salad is awesome, two of us share it because it is so large.  We do like to change it up and their menu has plenty of choices for when we are feeling adventurous.",1
1888,"This place is way overrated!!! They let ur car sit for 5-10 minutes before they even start to dry it.  By this time the water spots are already dry and they miss spots in the front or sides all the time.  Their armor all has gone down as well.  They used to have the best tire gloss that would last for 10 days, now they use a cheaper brand that's dull.  This place has really gone down over the years.  Again, way overrated.  30 second vacuum pfffff",0
1889,The food arrived fast and was super good. Some of the best waffles i have ever had. BUT it took more than 45 mins for us to get sitted. I get that it was 8 of us. But it wasnt even that busy. And 2 transactions per bill is bullshit! Specially if its 100+ bill. We get that it says on the menu but still we are your costumers you cant just take one more credit card. We would have appreciated it and probably end up coming back but nooo brother got all mad and walked away. Roscoes would have hook it up.,0
1890,"Recommended to Peculiar Rabbit by a friend, my boyfriend and I went here last weekend to sit on the rooftop veranda and enjoy the views of Charlotte and food.  We arrived at 7pm and were told it would be a 40-60 minute wait for roof top seating.  We obliged and enjoyed one of the limited drafts from the roof top bar.  75 minutes later, we were starting to get hangry and asked the hostess how much longer.  There were 4 open tables on the rooftop veranda the entire time, and we were pushed to the fire escape stairs to get out of the wait staff's way as we drank our beers. The hostess said at least another hour. We asked to just be seated inside or eat at the bar and the hostess said that would be a 30 minute wait and once we got seated it would take another 30 minutes for the kitchen to prepare our food because they were backed up.  We found it inconceivable to ask patrons to wait 2.5 hours to eat so we left the snippy hostess and vow not to return.  \n\nOver priced drinks\nRude hostess\nExtremely long wait time\nLimited beer selection\nKitchen cannot support entirity of the restaurant with new restaurant expansion\nNice view of Charlotte in distance\nNice view of Family Dollar and CVS parking lot",0
1891,"Went here, checked out the place and filled out a job application. Nice place, rather small, but perfect for taking a child or even a friend to create a fun pottery craft or buy something already made. Very friendly staff. Lots to see and do here if you're a crafty person.",1
1892,I stopped by last week for the free Tangy Jumbo Shrimp with an internet coupon.  The restaurant was located in the Meadows Mall in Las Vegas.  I got 3 shrimp with the tails on mixed with red bell peppers and green beans.  I would not pay for the Tangy Jumbo Shrimp.,1
1893,"I'm from Southern California and more specifically the 626 area (aka asian food central).  Super shocked to see a pretty busy boba place in the food court at the mall in Arizona.  My curiosity decided to give it a try.\n\nFirst off, their menu is SUPER overwhelming.  I'm definitely on the indecisive side when it comes to ordering anything, but they have so many different categories of \""""teas\"""" such as Flirteas (fruity flavors), Naughteas (creamy flavors), etc. It's a fun concept for each drink to have a cool name, but it took me a while to decipher that menu.  I do like how they have three options for sizes of drinks.\n\nCLUELESS: This Flirtea drink was made with guava, watermelon, lemon, strawberry, and green.  It normally comes with lychee jelly (or \""""gobi\"""" as they called it here), but I switched it out for boba without any charge.  Flavor and their quality of boba was surprisingly pretty good!!\n\nGOLDEN TEA BOBA: I think this was a make your own kind of tea option. Could not find it on their menu lol, shows how complicated it is.  Was recommended this and it totally reminds me of Lollicup's milk tea haha. \n\nPlenty of options and they can also adjust the amount sweetness per request.  What's unique here that I don't see often is that they have options for sweeteners in your drinks (i.e.: agave, honey, etc.) A little on the pricey side because it's in a nice mall, but that's expected.",1
1894,"When it comes to buffets I like to call myself experienced!! I love them! They are always full of an awesome variety of food and you can never go wrong with the fresh made stir fry....

Vegas is known for there buffets and great food and service at restaurants and other things but we are are talking food here! \n\nI kid you not after about a 15 min wait in line which is typical for buffets around dinner time so I'm not complaining about that but what started the hatred was the simple fact that it took 45 min to get our drinks. Yeah ok we had a table of 9 including kids but seriously 45 min to get water and a soda. We all were on our second go around of plates and ready to make the third trip down when we finally got our order of drinks that was placed when we first got there. Then to top it off as normal we finished our drinks fast yeah we were thirsty the lady took roughly 15-20 min To come back to our table with our refills. At this point I asked if she could just bring us a pitcher of water. Which to our surprise was pretty fast. (Now after you read my rant go through there pictures and witness first hand the nasty filthy pitcher she put on our table.) as we examine the filth inside and out and with the disappearance of our server again we decide to go to the front and ask to speak with a manager. Lady says what table are you ok I will send the manager there. 10 min 20 min 30 min 45 min go bye and finally after the waitress who just sees all of us sitting there asks If there is anything you need. At this point we say yes the manager that we have been waiting for! Now side note I'm not one to complain and moan but when it's bad it's bad. Finally after over 45 min the manager comes to our table we explain to her our issues with the wait for her, the drinks, the terrible service the terrible dried out food....which I've yet to rant about... The dirty nasty pitcher were just a few things that we laid into her. Much to our surprise She begins to defend her staff and say well thats not what she said, and on and on... lady look at the pitcher and examine the situation before you speak... then she goes on saying well you asked for a pitcher.. Damn straight we asked for a pitcher of water. Well I'm sorry sir but we don't give pitchers here. Ok wtf you did and look at it. Yes sir it appears to be dirty but again we do not give out pitchers and sir the water is clear... Wait what did she say. The water is clear so what my dogs bowl water is clear and you don't see me drinking Out of there bowl! Anyway she results to saying after she finally examines the situation and sees that it's been bad she lays into the server and basically tells her off she says well I can give you 2 comps and you can eat here again for free....um let me think about that. The service was terrible, the dish wear was filthy I mean so bad I wouldn't let my dog use it, the food was less than mediocre... hmm yeah I would love to come back said no one ever!!",0

1896,"I thought that Le Peep's was very good.  I liked how it was not such a big place, but the right size.  I had ordered the Desperado skillet and really enjoyed it.  It was a pretty big size that I wasn't expecting so much!  I had to bring some of it home.  It was still tasty when I ate it later.  I do recommend this place.",1
1897,"Okay, this is a storefront type restaurant, so the tacky d\u00e9cor can be forgiven.  What can't be forgiven is the filth.  The dining area is smaller than my living room which means there is no excuse for not keeping it clean.  The ceiling fans were caked with dust and grit as were many of the surfaces.  The floor was filthy.  Come on, guys, that place could be cleaned daily in less than 15 minutes. If the public area is that way, one can imagine what is in the kitchen.  I took my food home, opened the box, was craving Mexican food, but could not get myself to eat any of it, thinking of the general filth of the dining area and its implications for the kitchen.  I like seeing little places like this succeed, so I hope that someone decides to start cleaning this place on a regular basis.  No one likes clumps of dust dropping into their food from a neglected ceiling fan or wondering what the hygiene is in the kitchen.",0
1898,"I have been coming here fairly regularly and am normally very happy with the results. Each time I make an appointment, however, they are typically running 30-45 minutes late and it takes FOREVER to complete the appointment. I got my hair colored here one time and was in the place for close to 4 hours.... a little ridiculous. \nFor the most part, all of the students are really friendly and meticulous. The instructors are always roaming around to make sure the students are doing what they should be and they also check the students' work. \nI would recommend going here, just make sure you have a whole day free.",1
1899,"I was very impressed with the expertise of God's Garden Treasures.  I had unfortunately forgotten about Father's Day and on the Saturday before called them and asked if there was a way to deliver a gift that day. They said \""""no problem\"""" and came through with a perfect gift basket for my fickle father. It was delivered within hours of my call.  He loved all the cookies and treats but what was really surprising was his love for the basket that the treats came in.  He was keeping the basket. I will be using them again in the future!  Thanks again as my father thinks I come up with the best gifts ever!",1
1900,"Really good lunch spot for takeout (the restaurant is divided into takeout and dine-in, and the dine-in portion is relatively small for large groups). I'm a big fan of the classic mozzarella sandwich and vanilla bean rice pudding. They don't have much on their menu online, but the few items they do have, they do really well. If you order takeout, make sure to call in 15 minutes before your pick up time so that they'll have it ready. Otherwise, you'll be waiting for your takeout. \n\nIf you're going for a market sandwich, I recommend calling in to get their special. It can be a hit or miss. I got a market sandwich without calling once and ended up with a turkey sloppy Joe. It had a great taste but extremely messy and oily to eat.",1
1901,"Ate here in Jan 2013.  \n\nThis was always on our \""""must do\"""" list for Las Vegas.

The Frangria is still GREAT but the food was not.  The warm brie tasted like it had freezer burn or that refrigerator taste?   I know you know what I'm talking about.  The mussels were not good at all and were cold (should have been warm) and the frites were soggy.  \n\nService was good.  \n\nI'll go back and just have the Frangria next time we go, and just eat somewhere else.",0
1902,"We just had one of the worst and most frustrating dining experiences we've ever had. We had to hunt the totally inept waitress down for every single thing. It took us two hours to get served - some at the table served after all the others were done eating.

1903,"So I usually do not write a review unless I have something nice to say, but I'd like to corroborate all of the negative comments on here by agreeing that Cafe Boa made a wrong turn somewhere.  For years I ate here about once a month; I found the food to be delicious and for the most part the service was always decent.  I was surprised to see that they had completely changed their menu, and I was willing to give it a try, I had faith.  The overpriced pasta I had was tasty, but I was certainly still very hungry after finishing it.  I understand that pasta is traditionally a mid-course in many fine dining restaurants, and that it is not always large in size, but after serving hearty portions of pasta for years and years, to completely change your concept by giving us less food for more money seems pretty unintelligent, especially in an economic slump.  I have also noticed that the service has slipped here, once enthusiastic and unique, everyone seems kind of sad to be there.  Maybe I'll return someday..",0
1904,"Just to entertain myself I stopped in this Ross to compare it to my favorite Ross location (Sunnyslope/Dunlap store) Just as I expected it was total bootleg up in this location. Man the place was jacked! It's larger and you find a few more or different items as a result. The prices are the same as the other location on items that both have stocked. But this place looked like it had been hit by a plane. Broken stuff, stuff on the floor, stuff falling off hangers, stuff in the wrong departments and wrong shelves. Tables in complete disarray! Bedding and pillows on the floor. Lines...OMG! What long lines! \nThe couple of items that interest me that I spotted I passed on rather than wait in these long lines. No staff on the floor offering help. One poor staff person was putting out artwork and avoiding all contact with customers. Can't say I blame her because the customers were shouting for and at their unruly children and crying babies at decibels uncalled for. I think this clerk just wanted to disappear. So when I saw items of interest without a price I just respected her by not asking for help and leaving the items where I found them. \nThe odd thing is 3 hours before I had just shopped my favorite location where all was calm, organized and with short quick moving lines! So glad there are other locations of Ross stores near by offering the same great deals.",0

1906,"I have found my new perfect work spot! Weird, you say, because this is a market? But it's not just a market, but a cafe as well! They have a full coffee bar that reminds me of 21st Street Coffee down the street. They are, as well, serious about their coffee!\n\nYou can take a seat at many of the tables and enjoy a warm cup of chai, in my case, at least! Or grab lunch from their fresh and seasonal menu. I've had a delicious pear salad, with candied walnuts and goat cheese. It was on the small side, so I'd encourage you to grab a soup to go along with it. \n\nYou will probably notice the prices are not cheap. But that sort of thing comes with the territory of carrying local and fresh produce. I'm really into all the varieties of products I've never seen before. Better yet, they look so good I usually have to buy them (good job on their part!). I've found they have an awesome selection of Lara Bars and this certain grapefruit juice that isn't that sugary sweet crap you get from Minute Maid.\n\nI've still got a lot of ground to cover with ordering fresh meats and cheeses from their specialty counter. But I don't doubt I'll get to that... After all, this IS my new \""""office.\""""",1
1907,Took the girls there and basically they said all the clothes was ugly or for grandmas. The girl seemed to have a little attitude on her that a guy came with the ladies to shop. Basically it was like a expensive thrift store with clothes that would normally be at the bottom of your closet. Unless your really bored or in the mood to be disappointed I wouldn't go. Maybe Patty needs to get a clue what is in right now and definitely fire the little skank at the register.,0
1908,Went here for breakfast one day. No issues with the food it was standard diner fare but the slow was not even the word for the service. Needless to say we wound up walking the few extra minutes to Starbucks every other morning for the remainder of the trip and grabbed breakfast there instead.,0
1909,"Not sure why such high reviews.  Other than the friendly girl at the front counter this was pretty mediocre.  There was a kind-of dirty-plus-cleaning products odor to the place, there was a bussing tray sitting right next to the ordering counter the whole time.  The seats still had crumbs on them and the table some grease spots.  There's no ambiance and are no amenities - pizza delivered on a plastic tray, cheap plastic dishes for eating it, paper or styrofoam cups for the serve-yourself drinks.  This isn't an imaginative Italian restaurant with good food, table service,and nice tables and chairs.  It's a cheap pizza place with vinyl booths, windows with hand prints, and get-it-yourself silverware.\n\nThe food - well, it was fine for the price, but there are tons of places that serve decent pizza these days.  Granted this was better pizza than, say, Domino's, but that doesn't say too much.  There was a decent amount of cheese, but it's not like the quality of ingredients particularly stood out.  Pale tasteless tomato chunks, for example.\n\nI didn't see that this Barro's, at least, had much to recommend it.",0
1910,"I got a turkey club.  It was like 11.00 and took two guys like 10 minutes to cook it together.  The bacon was good but thats hard to get wrong.  The bread was good, but the lettuce was cooked with the meat and both were warm, soaking wet, and disgusting.  It was kind of like if you microwaved the lettuces on the sandwich.  The turkey was just kinda slimy and not very good at all.  They mayo was fine, but there could have been avocado, and for the money spent this was a rip.  I will say the guys who run the truck are super nice and have great customer service overall....just need to produce more bang for the buck.",0
1911,"I've given this place 3 chances and was disappointed every time! This is NOT good sushi! A classic California roll doesn't even have all 3 proper ingredients!

1912,"Today was my second time visiting. First time was okay. However, it appears that today the owner/manager was more interested in his bottom line. He missed me ordering their below average breakfast selections and less than okay coffee, so as lunch was nearing he asked that I please move to smaller table (the place was not busy). This would be fine if he had asked everyone in a similar situation, but he did not. Not to worry as I took my business up to Copper Star Coffee.",0

I ordered the fishermas platter and my guy friend who I went to dinner with ordered the fish and chips; both dishes were delicious! The fishermans platter/plate offered a great variety of items which included cod fillet, calamari, shrimp, and scallops. I had them grill my scallops and fish and boy did they do it just right. The calamari and shrimp I requested to be fried, together they gave me life!!!  I cannot wait to go back here, more so, bring some people and treat them. \n\nWe also ordered two sides: Mac and cheese (yum) and skillet fried corn (even more yummy).

Joe's now has a place in my heart and tummy, and without a doubt pocket book:)\n\nGo! It's a cool spot, with a lovely ambiance to share with friends, family, or business partners. And if you're concerned about the dress code I saw people there with sneakers on so there you have it.",1
1915,"No bueno.  We read about this restaurant in one of the Moon's AZ books as a place to try for good, New Mexican food = not.  It was worse then Chevy's...the margaritas tasted like water and I got so sick during dinner from the food & margarita I was donzo for the night.\nAlso, you're definitely not coming for the ambiance, it's definitely a hole of wall.  It would've been fine if the food made up for it - but you're better off at a chain restaurant down the street.",0
1916,"Dangerously delicious. Their macaroons are so rich, yet light at the same time. The last time I was there, I managed to eat three salted butter and caramel macaroons before I turned on my car... So. Good. And probably going straight to my hips!! Oh well, life is too short not to eat delightful pastries! And the prices are really reasonable! Go try! You won't be sorry! Your big butt might... But whatever. She'll get over it.",1
1917,"My wife and I came here on a Sunday night and other that beer being included, it was pretty bad. The food seemed to have been sitting under a heat lamp for a while, I can honestly say nothing I had was really good. It cost us $45 for 2 people and wasn't worth it. We're locals and have tried many of the buffets but will never come back to this one.",0
1918,"Came here with a date.  His choice, and glad he picked it. \n\nIt was a tad noisy for trying to get to know you without kinda yelling at your date across the table....Hope I didn't spit food on him. If I came with friends, the noise level would have been fine. \n\nI arrived early, so I sat at the bar and talked to the coolest bartender, Andrea.  She was the kind of person you just get drawn in and want to chit chat with all night.  She picked out a great glass of red wine for me too!\n\nWhen we say at our table, our waitress came around all bubbly and full of personality. I think her name was Kimberly. \n\nWe got the Caprese Salad to start and then tried the Diavolo pizza as our meal. Both were very delicious!!!  \n\nThe pizza was that good thin crust with lots of toppings and a great tasting crust. Definitely will be back here!",1
1919,"Epic Fail---a friend and I came here for the free buffet lunch they were advertising this week, and highly disappointed. We had to wait well over our quoted time ( no biggie, a lot of people were there for FREE) they let several parties go ahead if us that came in after us. Granted they were pretty packed, but there was about enough room for 20 seats on the patio and it was a beautiful day, so no reason not to use it. We asked the hostess if we could just go in for a drink while we wait, she said no. It was like Fort Knox trying to even go in. After over 1hr  (quoted 40 min) wait we finally got sat at the bar. The staff was rude, including the manager...he was fussing at the bartender in front if us, totally unprofessional. We asked if there was drink specials, and the response was \""""uh-no don't you think free lunch is special enough\"""" Dirty glasses were set in the bar beside us and ignored for most if the time we sat there. The food was bad, lacked flavor and selection. A little salt and pepper makes a world of difference...that should be culinary 101. Most if the time we went up to the buffet it was empty.  They need to leave the shrimp and grits up to Charleston restaurants, it tasted like instant grits w/shrimp thrown in as an after though....I make better shrimp and grits. No way would I'd pay $10 for this. Either they weren't prepared for the crowd or they have no idea what good food taste like. Also, they were doing free lunch yesterday and several people behind us in line said they had come yesterday for the same... They got in faster than we did...didn't think that was right, they'd already taken advantage if the freebie. Would NOT recommend this place, there are too many other great restaurants close by to chose from...spend your money there. Thank goodness it was free and I didn't have to pay for such a disappointing experience. #lame",0
1920,"Popped in this Sephora to seek shelter from the sweltering heat (100+ degrees in early July). I was promptly greeted by a gentleman who worked there. After learning that I was only \""""looking around\"""" and had no specific items to look for, he rather bluntly said that he \""""wanted to change my lip color.\"""" Okay, I thought, and let him lead me to a makeup station while he worked his magic and gave me a quick touchup of my lips and face. I thoroughly loved the look after he finished, and ended up purchasing the lipstick he used as a sample on me (Guerlain Rouge Automatique #160). I absolutely love this product, and have been using it ever since. It's creamy and super moisturizing (compared to the lipstick I was using immediately before walking into this Sephora). I hated having to put chapstick on my lips first and then apply the lipstick because it was so dry. I was at first suspicious when he told me that this product wouldn't be like that, but was quickly pleasantly surprised to find out that it was indeed very moisturizing. Although it was a bit pricey ($36 I believe), I don't regret the purchase at all because it's of such good quality. Throughout the process he also tried to engage me and asked me my name and where I was visiting from. He was just so jovial and exuberant the entire time, and I would've felt bad not buying anything he used on me afterwards (turned out that it was a good decision to get the lipstick anyway). Besides the Guerlain lipstick I also liked the bronzer he used on me, and now regret not buying anything else besides the lipstick (primer, bronzer, highlighter, etc) because I was trying to save money at the time. It was my first time getting a pro makeup session in a Sephora, and it was completely impromptu, but I loved it and am thinking of making an appointment or just popping in a Sephora in DC and getting some personal beauty advice. I'm sure many other girls also fell for the highly effective salesperson that I encountered, and had trouble declining to make any purchase because he was so friendly and made an effort to connect with you. Although he could be labeled as \""""pushy,\"""" I didn't find it at all invasive or annoying (like I said, I probably just fell for the cute attempts at striking up a meaningful conversation with me). But more importantly, the product I ended up purchasing was really great, and what he had told me is really true. Not to mention that I also liked the look he created on my face. If I'm in Vegas next time I'll definitely try to stop by again (even if not this Sephora, then definitely to one of the three that are on the Strip).",1
1921,"The menu is really limited. The prices are literally insane. Yes, there is free house wine, but that is not free when you have to pay $25 for a plate of spaghetti. Most of the meals were in the $35 range. Not an elegant place, but the atmosphere is a rustic place steeped in history.",0
1922,"Let's get something quick to eat, yeah? OKAY!\n\nPho is supposed to be fast. Just ladle that soup broth over the noodles and meat and you're fricking done. Right? NO, NOT HERE.\n\nMy friend ordered spring rolls, which were 2 tiny rolls cut in half. That took a good 40 minutes to make. (BTW, there were barely any other customers, so it's not like they were busy making other food!)\n\nThe rest of us ordered pho, which took nearly an hour for it to come out. We would've bounced the fuck outta there if we didn't feel so bad for doing so. So we just stayed because we were hungry and waited that long already.\n\nWhen we finally got our food, it wasn't even that good! The broth was piping hot, which was nice...but that's probably what they were doing this whole time...boiling the soup. My friend mentioned that they \""""forgot the flavor.\"""" Yup, the broth had little to no flavor. Plus, my rare steak tasted sour, which meant it was probably old and should not be eaten!\n\nPeople who have rated this restaurant anything better than 2 stars have not eaten GOOD pho before. Also, if you were drunk/hungover when you ate here, I'll excuse you because of the lack of judgment.\n\nLesson to be learned: Don't eat pho in Vegas!",0
1923,"So I want to premise this by stating that I am not someone that goes to a restaurant trying to hate the food, especially Mexican food which has always been one of my favorites, but if your going to open a Mexican food joint in AZ you better be on point...\n\nMy sister and I went here on the advice of some friends, the restaurant was clean, the service was good, we were seated immediately,  we basically had our choice of seats because the restaurant was empty, literally empty.  They brought out the chips and salsa, this to me an important first impression for any good Mexican food restaurant, if your trying to claim that you make great Mexican your salsa better be awesome, it wasn't...they offered three different kinds, a mild with corn, black bean, and tomato, that pretty much all looked and tasted like they came out of a can, a green that was decent, and a red salsa that was really watery, the flavor was okay but the consistency was really watered down and not terribly appealing.  At least the chips were fresh, like I said at this point I'm still looking for things to like lol.\n\nI ordered the \""""Farmers Burrito\"""" with the adovada pork, our waitress said that anything with the pork was awesome.  It wasn't terrible (thus the two stars) it was just really bland, the pork tasted a lot like something my grandma would make in a crock pot (sorry grandma lol) but you know what I'm saying, just very bland, it had tomatoes, corn, and cheese in it also, I think it was just their \""""mild salsa\"""" which again kind of tasted to me like it came of a can. \n\nMy sister had the taco salad, also with the adovado pork and it was also very bland, even the dressing which was supposed to be some kind of a pablano ranch dressing just didn't have much flavor.  and tasted more like lettuce than anything else.\n\nMexican food has long been one of my favorites because it lends itself to great flavors, more than just spice, but great southwestern flavor, in my opinion La Ristra just missed the mark.  I'm surprised by the other reviews on here, and maybe they were just having an off day, but I'm not sure I'll be back to find out.  I hope they improve,  I love small businesses, and never want to see anybody fail but a Mexican Food joint in this market better be killing it, and this just didn't do it for me...",0
1924,"Tessaro's, I kept hearing, was the best burger joint in the burgh. The award, in my opinion, is still up in the air. I have quite a few more places to check out!\n\nA huge plus to Tessaro's for their kitchen! Wow is that thing small. And the two guys working were rolling the burger patties right through the window. AHHH MAZING! I also heard Tessaro's butchers their own meat on site. I love hearing this. \n\nTessaro's is definitely worth checking out. The lunch crowd gets a bit tight as their tables are close. Perhaps try a bit before or after the average lunch hour. Oh, and they aren't open on Sundays so steer clear of that day.",1
1925,"I had them manage a couple of my properties for a few years and they were OK then their office manager or the main person I dealt with suddenly was gone then the service went downhill, really very poor service which was costing me money.  Hired a new management company and am much happier now.  Overall not a good experience with them.",0
1926,"Not my cup of tea. \n\nI went in with some friends for an early dinner. The place wasn't too busy when we arrived and it's seat yourself so we grabbed a table and sat down. Our waitress was super friendly but the food just didn't do it or me. \n\nI'm not an ice tea drinker (I know...I know) so I can't comment on that but here goes:\n\nFor our appetizer we ordered the deviled eggs which come topped with chicken and bacon. How could you mess that up??? Well, the presentation was just bad. It looked like they just threw the eggs and toppings on the plate. To make matters worse, the flavors just were not good. It was like the chicken came out a can...ugh! No thank you.\n\nFor my meal, I ordered the chicken and waffles. I knew based on previous reviews, to ask for my syrup on the side...to avoid syrupy chicken. But let's just say, again that the textures and flavors were a huge miss. I expected the waffle to be light and fluffy...nope. Instead it was dry and crumbled with each bite. That's not a good thing...the saving grace was the tabasco butter. Now, that was yummy.\n\nThe chicken was not crispy and I wasn't a fan of the skin...See I am not one of those girls that takes the skin off and only eats the chicken meat...Nooooo....normally I eat it all. But not here...the skin nor the chicken were good for me. \n\nSo pretty much Sweet Tea's just wasn't for me.",0
1927,"Buffet of Buffets: Stop #3 & Final Stop. \n\nLots of choices. I mean that's what they are known for right? I was still surprised though. I mean there was so much to eat. Food overload. How was I supposed to get to it all?\n\nRibs were the best here. The meat just falls off the bone and the sauce is just slightly sweet and not too overpowering and saucy. I love their ribs! \n\nMore thoughts: The teppanyaki was also fun to watch. The alcoholic drinks are very inexpensive. Happy hour $2/4/6 drinks. They've got gelato too. The carrot cake was tasty. The Carival World Buffet was the best of all of the one I tried this weekend. I liked everything that I put on my plate. The variety is a plus too. \n\nBuffet of Buffets: We only made it to 3 but that's not too bad. Definitely got our money's worth. Now, I don't want to hear the word buffet for a really long time. =P Can I just order out the ribs from the Rio and the macaroons from Paris? Pretty please?",1
1928,The food and atmosphere is excellent here. We had a bit of a strange incident with the people that were there hanging out....I won't go into detail but this place is not for kids. It would be a great date spot as it's quiet and intimate with low lighting and good music. Food was amazing I would definitely go back for the food and wine and hopefully the crowd won't be so crude and inappropriate.,1
1929,"Well I don't really \""""do\"""" sports betting so I have no clue what a 5 star rating would mean, but this place is pretty nice and we've got a system down now for March Madness. The sitting areas are spacious and comfortable, and if you're willing to get there early (like 4am early) you can stake out a good area for the whole tournament. The screens are huge and the waitresses are quick to come around. Make sure to get your drink tickets when you place your bets! You usually get a free drink ticket for every $50 bet but if you tip the bet taker at the counter they'll hook you up with a nice stack. You can also do some crafty betting on the horse races and get drink tickets that way. It's close to the bathrooms and food court so it's really a great spot to watch the games when you're in Vegas, so check it out!",1
1930,"This used to be one of my favorites restaurants,not anymore, the last couple of times that I visit this place the eating experience has been terrible. From poor service to mediocre food. I will defenitely will remove this place from my reaturant list. is not worth the money.",0
1931,"Don't eat here!!! Waited in line with 10 other people for 30 minutes even though there were a dozen open tables. We concluded they were trying to get a line going to draw attention to the place. The food was not good, basically Hometwon Buffet style. To too it off I got food poisoning, probably from the sushi. The only redeeming quality is if you drink they have free alcohol. I would strongly warn people against eating here.",0
1932,"I love this place.  I used to live in Squirrel Hill.  I first started going there as a bar patron, then quickly realized how great the food is.  Their buffalo chicken dip is awesome!  Its pretty great food for a reasonable price.  The bartenders are great too!",1
1933,"Good course and you are playing here for the novelty of playing on the strip. Friendly staff, no range is not a knock because there is no space to hit balls on a highway. Holes are very close to one another, again, due to space constraints. Long par 4 s are essentially the same as the short par 5s. I played a good 3-4 holes that I had to double check I had not played them before and was out of sequence on the course. Par 3s are the most memorable, island green 16 is no more than a PW. Enjoyable round and agree with prior review, book with golf now for savings.",1
1934,"This was my 2nd time here. Raku is probably the best restaurant I've ever been to! It's so much better than anything on The Strip. Some favorites include the sea urchin cold dish, sashimi specials, and pork cheek and pork ear skewers. The specials board can be a bit spendy, but I've never been disappointed. Save room for dessert at Snowflake shavery in the same parking lot--the perfect ending to a perfect meal.",1
1935,"I know this place has been here for some time, but it took me a while before I actually paid this place a visit, and as a New Years meal, I didn't regret it. \n\nI don't go out to eat ramen too often and I only have had Monta up to this point, and I need to familiarize myself with different restaurants around the valley and I know Ramen Sora is another popular choice, so I decided to pay it a visit. \n\nIt is a small place and the parking can get a little hectic since they have a small lot and you might have to park in the adjacent street. When you go in, don't forget to write down your name, or you're gonna be stuck looking like an idiot waiting for someone to help you out, like I did. \n\nI was promptly seated with my party and it didn't take long before they came to take our order. I got the ramen deluxe with corn, and I feel like that was a good value for its price. They have larger bowls, but the only thing you get more of is soup and noodles. That's up to you if you believe it's worth the extra price, but I stuck with the normal sized bowl. \n\nI enjoyed everything in my bowl from the noodles, to the broth, to the egg. I have no complaints with Ramen Sora and I will be making another visit to this place in the nearby future. I recommend this place if you just want to eat at another ramen place in Las Vegas, or just somewhere to get some hot soup, especially during winter!",1
1936,"Best Vietnamese in town! I used to live in Laos, and visited Vietnam a number of times. This place is a great memory lane for me. Really quick service, cozy feeling dining hall. I have never done the buffet, I always order strictly Viet food from the menu and have never been let down.",1
1937,"Recently went back and saw a really nice looking leather and fur coat, but upon purchasing I asked the cashier what kind of fur it was he told me it was faux-pony fur. For $400? Absolutely not. Whoever runs this place needs to wake up and ditch the faux leather and fur. It's awful! How does it make sense to wear plastic instead of natural leather or fur? It just doesn't. I've spent already $1200 on leather coats with them but this time I was really disappointed, I won't go back.",0
1938,"Okay, we walked into this place by chance. It seemed loud and fun. However there was 8 people at the bar, every 5 minutes the bartender would scream that there was something new to celebrate, whether it was the couple next to us getting married ( \""""last  shot the missus is gonna take and swallows\""""...oh god kill me) or the kid next to me is 21, or my husband is wearing a sparkly shirt. Okay I'm in here for less then 15 minutes and we are all ready taking a shot apiece me and two others. Multiply that by $7  you got $63. We just spent $63 in less than 15 minutes during \""""happy hour\"""". I had to leave so my poor husband wouldn't keep dishing out loot, that's not counting tips! The girls were fun and just doing their jobs but its a scam. Seems fun the first 5 minutes but you will soon be scratching to get the fuck out.",0
1939,"We did takeout and it was really good. \n\n$15 for a hell's kitchen burger which is amazing.  It was so delicious, the meat just melted right in my mouth.  The seeded bun was also yummy, especially when they toast it with butter.  The chipotle ketchup on the side was so yummy I could eat it alone.  \n\nThe truffle fries were very tasty and pricey, but they need  to lower the garlic taste of the fries.  It was overpowering.  The truffle aioli tames it down and reminds you that they are truffle fries and not garlic parmesan.\n\nI would definitely go back here just for their burger.  We had a wagyu burger with shiitake mushrooms at Tommy Bahama the other day and Gordon's definitely beat his.",1
1940,"Ok everyone was right.\nThis place is freaking awesome!\n\nThe VARIETY! WOW~! Totally worth for what I paid for!\nThe seafood part was the best! The shrimp were jumbo size and fresh, including the juicy half shell oysters! Could't get enough of it!\n\nI love how they had Korean Kalbi, it was extremely tendered. The sushi was pretty good, and ginseng chicken soup was legit! Tasted like my grandmothers cooking! The macaroons...wow where do I start! The quality of those deserts were way better than some of the bakeries I've been to. I've tried the Ramen & the Udon and they were both pretty good as well.\n\nBut the seafood man... that was the best thing at the buffet~",1

1942,"They over-cooked the Halibut in the special. Four people in our party that had it, spent 2 days with GI problems. The guacamole was more like a salad, than a dip. Big chunks with no creamy goodness. The only redeeming quality was the waiter was very nice. Will not go back.",0
1943,"Best authentic Mexican food in the East Valley. I'm set in my ways and get the carne asada burrito every time (been going here 6 years), and it has never disappointed.

Oh, and regardless the item on the menu, you'll leave VERY full for under $7 bucks.",1

1947,"We stopped in here for a gallon of water and some vitamin waters- pretty dirty place. I watched some chick go to the donut area and naked fist a donut and start eating it, in front of the clerk. Which is ok to them, I guess, but it is so not alright when you hand them an apparently incorrect amount thinking it is. In that case, they yell it even louder.

1949,"Hugo's Cellar was the first \""""fancy schmancy\"""" restaurant that my husband (then boyfriend) tried in Vegas about six years ago. I remember being very impressed by the high class service and the intricately made food. I wondered, was this place good because it was in my pre-Yelp days? Or was it really THAT good? Yes, sir, this place is as good as I remembered.\n\nThis restaurant is in an unlikely location. It's inside Four Queens. Downtown Las Vegas has drastically improved over the last few years but admittedly I still hold my purse close to me when I walk around. I would highly suggest to valet your car because the garage elevator was broken and I had to go down four flights of stairs in heels! Hey, if you're going to a fancy schmancy restaurant, you might as well splurge on valet!\n\nOnce you get to the restaurant, ladies are given a single red rose. The restaurant is dark and has a old school Vegas feel. We were seated in a booth, and I appreciated the romantic ambiance. Waiters were all wearing tuxedos. They even poured water with a certain flair.\n\nMy favorite part about this place is the table side prepared salad. It comes free with your entree and you get an array of toppings to choose from! They give a cute mini raspberry sorbet to cleanse your palette. I ordered the ribeye steak and my husband got the Chilean sea bass. We both savored every single bite and still had leftovers to take home! \n\nI'm not sure if it's because they knew it was our anniversary but we got hooked up with lots of desserts! We got an assortment of chocolate covered strawberries, figs and apricots to dip in whipped cream. Then we got a chocolate mousse cake that was melt-in-your-mouth amazing! Oh my, my mouth is watering just writing about it.\n\nIf you're looking for romance, good food and great service, you can't go wrong with Hugo's Cellar!",1
1950,"Horrible service, mediocre food.

1952,"If I could I would give the show 4 1/2 stars. I really enjoyed this show! I've seen many of the cirque shows here in Vegas over the years (e.g., Ka, Mystere, O, etc.) and I'm not sure why this show has bad reviews. Right from the beginning this experience was great. We were fortunate to get tickets closer to the front and I have got to say that these were the most comfortable seats.. they were wider and just plain pleasant to sit in. Right before the show started, like most cirque shows, they had the actors come out to entertain the crowd which was really fun. One of the actors who was carrying a spell book of some sort was given some popcorn by an audience member. He put a kernel on a guys head and wouldn't let him take it off even while he was walking away. It was really funny and a 'you had to have been there' type of thing. There were other funny things going on around the theater too. \n\nThe show had some really good acts. I especially enjoyed the juggler, she was also kind of feisty and worked the crowd well with a few eyebrow flicks and a smile. The sand artist was excellent as well, she was so quick and the pictures she created were beautiful. Like a typical cirque show it had a lot of acrobats and high flying acts and of course they were extremely talented and fun to watch. Sure the show is light on story but the acts are all top notch. \n\nTo sum up, if you want to watch a good cirque show in Vegas with great acrobatics and artistry and don't mind little story this would be a fun one to go and see. It's a very nice break from losing money gambling.:)",1
1953,Got food poisoning from this particular Taco Bell. : (  Will never eat Taco Bell again.  I don't care how late you're open OR how much I've had to drink...it's not worth it.   If you're looking for great Mexican food...go up the street to Fausto's or Roberto's.,0
1954,"I was craving macaroni and cheese one day and a friend recommended this place. I wasn't impressed on my first visit, but decided to give it another try. The macaroni and cheese was creamy, but very bland. I think the noodles were a bit over cooked as well. Since the mac & cheese is only a side dish, I ordered a waffle with it. The waffle was thin (not Belgian), dry, and bland. The syrup made it edible, but I still wouldn't recommend it. I ordered some of the blue kool-aide & they must have added a lot of extra sugar to their mix. It was the sweetest kool-aide I've ever tasted before! This could be a good or bad thing depending on how you like your kool-aide. The service was a little better this visit, but I have had my fill of Lolo's and will not be back!",0
1955,"I really do love bookstores! I enjoy just taking my time and meandering through each section, looking at everything on display. I hope upon hope that actual paper books never go the way of the dodo, that would make me one unhappy girl! \n\nChanging Hands offers a couple things that i like: they have both new and used books, they do have a reasonably sized children's section, they have a small area of clever gifts and fun things for your home/office and they have an area for lectures, book signings and things of that nature. I think it is pretty cool you can take your used books in and they will give you store credit for them. I have brought in a couple boxes and they definitely gave me a fair prices for the trades. (If for some reason they do not want/do not accept a particular book, you can request what they don't buy to come back to you (or) you can have them donate the books which is what i do.)\n\nClearly i am a fan and will continue to come back for my books & random fun gift needs.\n\n~the end~",1
1956,"Okay, this place has been a god send for me more than once. I have ended up on a late flight into Charlotte, and this place is open late and is a stones throw away from the Drury. I have had beer, burgers, wings, and all sorts of other things here and have never had anything that I didn't like. Service is always friendly and the tables have always been clean. I will be stopping here again.",1
1957,"This place needs more credit than what it's been given. They have amazing sides and plenty to choose from, the meat was tender, juicy and full of flavor, and service was great. Not to mention the sauce is in a heated dispenser- win! The man working behind the counter who helped us said he was from Georgia... Georgia people! He's gotta know what he's doing lol Rudy's and their paper-lined baskets and weird sides... meh! Come here for a real BBQ meal.",1
1958,Do not take your toddler here. We love Asian food and wanted to try this place very badly. I got the citrus chicken which was okay and my wife got the sesame chicken which was bland. They did bring us out a sample of their Miona chicken which was very good. The strange part was my 20 month old daughter was fascinated by the waterfall display and wanted to check it out next thing you know they are giving us a togo menu saying our daughter cant sit still and next time we should order to go ? It was the strangest thing we have experience at a restaurant with our daughter. THREE times they told us to order TO GO next time. We felt that our daughter who was well behaved was not wanted in the restaurant. After this experience and the so so food we will not be back.,0
1959,"This apartment is TERRIBLE!!!! I have had nothing but issues since I moved in 2 weeks ago. Not only did the staff misinform us on information about the apartment prior to moving in, but they called me 3 days before moving in to tell me that I have to wait another day to move in because the office is closed. We had this move in date set for 3 months. Now this may not be an issue to many people, but it was a problem for me because I moved from Chicago. I needed to move in the day I was planning on because I had no where else to stay. That was just the beginning though... \n\n1.) We realized a few days after moving in that we were charged over $500 more on our rent than we were supposed to pay. They did inform us that we paid $420 over. However, after reviewing the statement the office gave us, which included everything we were charged and have paid, it made no sense. Basically, we saw that they charged us two times on things that should have only been charged one time and all of the math was wrong. The amount they owe us just kept adding up. \n\n\n2.) We have ZERO cell service in our apartment. It is a complete dead zone. My roommate and I are also not the only ones with this issue. We have talked to other residents who have complained about having no cell service. This may not be the staff's problem, which we understand, but it sucks that I have to lay against my bedroom window just to talk to my mother because that is literally the only place I can get MAYBE 2 bars on my phone.\n\n\n3.) The next issue, which we have ben dealing with for about a week now, is our cable. The day we moved in the staff in the office told us that we can get Cox or DirecTV. We decided on DirecTV. The morning the man came to install it, he told us that these things he needed to access on the roof were completely closed off and he could not access them until the maintenance people opened them. My roommate and I went straight to the office to ask if they could open the things on the roof. They told us it would be a half hour, so we had to send the DirecTV man away so we could make his other appointment. FOUR HOURS LATER, the maintenance people still had not fixed anything. I went and asked the office if it was finished yet and the lady helping me didn't even think to call the maintenance people to ask, she only thought to e-mail them. Pretty dumb considering a phone call would take much less time and she would get a response quicker through a phone. I went in the office again the next day to see if they finally finished the task, and they told me it was all worked out. \n\nSo the DirecTV man came back today. He told us that the maintenance people only opened one of the things on the roof and not all of them. When we went to ask the maintenance people to finish their original task, they were extremely rude to us. They also proceeded to tell us that WE need to go to all of the apartments above us and ask if we can get access to their utility closet on their balconies in order to drag a cord down to our apartment just so we can get cable. I find this completely ridiculous!! We shouldn't have this many issues just to get cable in our apartment. Also, the maintenance people should have done everything that needed to be done 5 days ago when we originally asked them to. They just did a half ass job and complained that they have \""""too much to do.\"""" BULL SHIT!\n\n\nI have only lived here for 2 weeks and I already hate it. I have never had more issues than I have had here in any other apartment I have lived in. The staff in the office have no idea how to help us with anything, and the manager is extremely rude. Not only was she a total bitch to my roommate, but she was even more awful to my roommate's mother. Completely disrespectful and not helpful one bit. The only good thing about this place are the amenities. The pool is pretty and they have a good gym. Besides that, I would NOT suggest living here.",0
1960,I gather from Jaime who works here that they are hurting and they brought him in to stop giving things away.  Now they charge $2 for a squirt of air freshener.  Wow... won't be back again.  This place is now double the cost of the car wash just north on 83rd in front of Walmart.  The quality and customer care has gone there instead of here.,0
1961,"The service here was very good. Karols, our sever made sure everything is great. The steak was cooked perfectly. The wine list is pricey for the wines they do have. Only 1 type of Shiraz on the wine list. The Goat cheese mashed potatoes were good, only a hint of goat cheese is what you can taste. The au gratin potatoes were the best. The lobster is huge and they crack it right in front of at your table. Overall, great place to eat, it is a bit noisy in the restaurant.",1
1962,"I found this place on Yelp after searching for vegan restuarants. I walked in and the waitress greeted me. She was very pleasant. So I will give 3 stars for customer service but the food was awful! It was definitely not worth 10.00 dollars. I got it to go but if not  I would definitely have complained. The prices are way to expensive and for the amount of food they give you, its not worth it. I was so disappointed because I heard good things about this place and I have been searching for decent vegan restuarants. I definitely would not recommend this place!",0
1963,"Based on Yelp reviews, my husband and I have been enjoying Lalibela's delicious food for several years.  We calendar in a visit every time we travel to Phoenix.\n\nHaven't had a disappointing meal. The first time we ordered the sampler platter.  It was huge and provided a terrific array of their tasty vegetable and meat dishes.  My current favorite is the spicy beef and chicken with a side of green beans and carrots.  My husband loves the meat combination.  My descriptions don't do the dishes justice.  The spice and flavor combinations are so deliciously wonderful.\n\nWish Lalibela's was closer to home.  We would eat there all the time.",1
1964,"I don't understand the layout of this place. With all the revenue coming into this city you'd think their airport would be more upscale and clean. I've seen bus stations that are cleaner. I fly Southwest a lot and it's pure chaos in the C terminal. People are lined up to get on in the same small place people are getting off. The main artery is a huge mess only further complied by the fact they put slot machines in the way. I'm constantly being bumped into and pushed coming and going. The TSA, as always isn't very efficient and as mush as they think they have line control... they don't. There is a a general lack of seating at the food courts as well.\n\nPro Tip: If you have a flight out of the B gates, use the upstairs C and D gate TSA and cross over. The B and A gate lines are always longer.",0
1965,"One of the best sandwich shops I've ever been to.\n\nThe sandwiches are actually as big as advertised, you can barely fit your mouth around them!  I highly recommend the Turkey and Avocado.  Friendly staff, a little pricey, but well worth it!",1
1966,"Yeah, good concept, but very expensive. How much does elbow macaroni cost? For 9.00 you should be able to take some home. Do you know that the pasta might coat them.75 cents if that? This place is way overpriced, and dont tell me that the cheeses cost them an arm and a leg. They should double the portion and then I would go back. It cost 28.00 for me and three kids for pasta. What a joke..Never again! Make it at home..will be closed in 2014",0

Also our server, Lalo, thank u for taking care of us and for my birthday flan!!! U r awesome!!!!",1
1968,"I went to Maizie's last night, after downloading the Yelp App for my iPhone.  I was stunned at the quality of the food and the outstanding service.  Our server knew the menu, knew how to treat customers and had some great recommendations for us to try.  I got the Blue Burger, and it had the Blue Cheese stuffed inside the patty.  Yum.  And the fries were perfect.  Not the pre-made bag fries, but fresh cut with the skin on and deep fried to perfection (not soggy).  After settling the tab, we walked out and one of the staff (not our waitress) even poked her head out the door and said thanks and goodbye.  That's excellent customer service in my book.\n\nThere was only one thing wrong, and this goes for a large number of restaurants, bring me the bottle of ketchup (catsup), not some tiny little dipping cup.  I hate when, you're in the middle of your meal and you have to wait for a server to fetch you another ketchup (catsup).\n\nWe will be back to try some of the other menu items, that's a promise.",1
1969,"Van Galder is also known as coach USA. It is the most convenient way to get from Madison to Chicago O'hare or downtown without driving!\n\nI would say tickets are not cheap. If you're looking for deals, head over to mega bus and watch for sales. Till further notice, the pick up and drop off at UW campus has moved to university avenue at Chazen. The tickets however, are still sold at the Memorial Union if you would like to purchase student priced tickets. Do remember to bring your student ID for verification and you can only buy one ticket per day at the MU. \n\nIf you're not a student, you can buy tickets online and print them, or buy them on board with cash. Sometimes, on the double decker bus you can get plugs to charge your gadgets! But I couldn't get the ones on the roof to work... \n\nAll in all, van galder is a convenient way to get to the cheaper flight fares in ORD. The only 2 bad experiences were a 1.5h delay to reach downtown Chicago as the bus was late to Madison and a very unfriendly uncle who wanted to drive off with my friend's luggage while she went to the bathroom:/",1
1970,"My second heaven!\nI glided inside the way Chandler and Joey glided into Monica and Rachel's apartment except no porcelain dog was involved.\n\nI went straight to the aisle where I can stock up on my cans of Dace in salted black beans. Bought $35 worth. Then skipped around to the baker... mmmm curry beef pastry and cream-filled pastry. Went to the back and picked out some fish for the deep fryer. Then over to the noodle section to stock up.\n\nI am a happy camper. Cooked so much Asian food while in Chandler, that getting an In-and-Out burger while on my way back up the mountain, my usual ritual, just seemed unfathomable.

1971,"I've been to the Nitty Gritty about four or five times before hockey games and always enjoyed it. The bar was full, a bit tough to get a bar but expected, and it seemed like a great time. We recently went there to watch the NCAA Football National Championship. I thought it'd be a nice place for a group of about 8 of us to watch it. The game wasn't on when we got there, and we mentioned we wanted to watch it and they sat us where we could see the game and then put the game on. There were a few tables of people in the bar with people, and all of us were interested in the game. However, they would not turn the sound on. We asked the waitress, and she spoke to the manage, and the returned to tell us sorry but she couldn't. We didn't really understand why, as everyone wanted to watch it, so we asked to talk to the manager. He came over and said his boss wouldn't let him do it, but he'd be happy to send this person over. Ok, we'll keep doing this, we thought. Yes, please send him over. Well that person never arrived. We waited and waited for about 20-30 min for the person to give us a reason why they wouldn't turn the sound on for a game that everyone was watching. We got fed up and walked over to the Steak and Lube that had the game on with sound and a lot of people watching it. I do not think I'll be heading back to the Nitty Gritty (unless it's before a hockey game) anytime soon.",0

1973,"I came here for my annual mole checkup a few months ago, and was delighted to meet Dr. Davey!  It's kind of awkward having a man do a full body mole check, but he had a female assistant stand in, and made conversation the whole time to put me at ease.  He is so nice and very knowledgeable- just what you want in a dermatologist!  Also, when I asked about Botox he didn't try to pressure me to get more than was necessary or push it on me right then and there. He just clearly gave me the facts and a quote, which I really appreciated.  No pushy sales approach, just helpful info.  Also, he told me that he does the injections himself- unlike a lot of places that have nurses or PAs do them instead of the doctor. Bonus!  The office was beautiful and clean, and the staff was super nice.  You can tell he's from KY - he's got those good Southern manners.  Also, he's very affordable for how experienced he is and how gorgeous the office is!  Bottom line: if you want a great doctor who will make your skin beautiful but not be pretentious and \""""Scottsdale\"""" about it- then go see Dr. Davey!",1

1975,"I wish I could give negative stars. I went their twice, once for a consultation and the second time for my surgery, and they were rude to me from the second I walked up to the counter. Whoever makes the appointments sent me to the wrong place, telling me that my appointment was for my old location. I had my consultation to have my wisdom teeth removed, while they were talking to me, they were condescending, talking to me like I was a 5 year old. Three weeks later we were contacted to schedule my surgery, I went and waited for 3 hours for them to pull me back into the office saying they were out of anesthetics. When we asked if they would contact my insurance or schedule a new appointment we were told to do it because \""""that is not MY problem\"""" by the women in the office. We later found out that they never did contact my insurance, so that would have been a $900 bill for me.",0
1976,"The word that comes to mind is gratuitous. The portion size, the amount of frosting on the cinnamon roll, the thick slices of French toast dripping with strawberries, the sauce, garlic, and cheese on the eggs... You get the point. \n\nThe result was tons of food that tasted fresh and absolutely indulgent. My only complaint is that it was so good I ate myself sick.",1
1977,"I'll have to defer to the folks who think the $20.13 deal for lunch is a good one.  I'm sure it is and I'll might try it the next time I'm in Vegas.   And if I was on an expense account or, as I assume from what I could observe of many of my fellow patrons when we were there, using my daddy's (or my sugar daddy's) credit card, a lavish, no holds barred dinner here would be a pleasant way to spend an evening without a care in the world,  Service that we had sitting at the bar was very professional, but I'm cutting them some slack for gently pushing the purchase of the restaurant's olive oil (a touch tacky, I think).\n\nThe problem is that the price of the dishes in the evening, given what you receive, is way out of line with the value.  Now,  I'd guess that many of my fellow patrons could give a flying fig about dollar value, but that's not how I roll.  I can justify dropping many hundreds of dollars for a meal for two on occasion if I was presented with dish after dish with double plus wow factor.  Here though, we're talking about relatively simple Mediterranean cuisine centered on Greek cooking.   I love that stuff big time, as it is the food that launched the cultures of the Greeks, the Phoenicians, the Romans, and the southern Spanish and French.  But no matter how much effort goes into sourcing the best or freshest this or that, at the end of the day you're dealing with a few ingredients cooked in a straightforward manner, maybe a couple of minutes on a grill, steamed to get just beyond raw, or pasta\\rice tossed in boiling water just long enough to still have a little tooth to it.  Simple food from a land that is relatively poor.\n\nThat's why I have to give Milos a 2 star based on our single visit just sampling the appetizer selections: this is simple food that is insanely expensive, albeit clearly involving good ingredients.  I can't give you exact prices (the menu on their website is outdated) but here is an example.  We ordered the grilled sardines.  This dish, a staple of the impoverished fishing villages of Portugal that involves simply brushing on a little olive oil and salt and tossing on a BBQ, was something like $22.  For that amount of money we received all of....four small sardines.  If the Greeks got over $5 for a fish the size of your index finger, they wouldn't be in a financial crisis right now.  The bottarga (grey mullet roe) was nearly $30, but turned out to be four tiny crackers with a sliver, and I mean a sliver, of cured roe.  The grilled octopus was very tasty, and the portion size we received was enough for two folks for sure, but at close to $30 the value simply wasn't there.  And perhaps the worst offender was the least expensive: the taramosalata was so bland and un-fish-like that we initially thought they had served us an order of hummus.  Even if it was under $10, and it certainly wasn't (maybe closer to $20), it wasn't worth what we had paid.\n\nI guess I'm just cranky though, because the place was packed with folks ordering the $300 grouper and thinking nothing about dropping $65 for a couple of lamb chops.  For me though, I'll save my money and spend it at a true Mediterranean restaurant that gives you decent bang for the buck.  \n\nNick in Palm Springs\n\nP.S.: How can a restaurant named \""""Estiatorio Milos\"""" offer only a single variety of Ouzo?  The Greeks of the world would be outraged by this travesty!",0
1978,"Wow I'm really happy I found Berchicci.  It really is a nice change from me having to trek down to little Italy to my regular joint Milano.  If their store hours here were a bit friendlier to my schedule (only open to 2 PM on Saturdays and closed Sunday) I believe I would be here even more!\n\nLet me preface this review by mentioning I just returned from 2 weeks in Italy. Coming to shop here I noticed a bunch of other items that were not available at other Italian grocery stores. One such was blood orange juice (arancia rossa). There is a very large selection of all your Italian staples and basics. Also a deli counter and plentiful selections of cheeses. \n\nAnother great thing was they had this high quality pasta on for 6 bags of dried pasta for $5. Can you say C-R-A-Z-Y prices! There are weekly specials. \n\nIn the back it's like a mini- Italian Costco with food on pallets and you have the opportunity to buy one or bulk units at very reasonable inexpensive prices!\n\nDefinitely a great find, but you need a car to head here as it's a bit tucked away in the Montreal N/RDP boundary.",1
1979,"My neighborhood just keeps getting better and better, and I'm grateful that the extremely kind, attentive staff at Teppanyaki Kyoto is part of that.

Chef Gerard Canales, formerly head chef at the highly acclaimed Japenego restaurant at the Hyatt Lake Las Vegas Resort, has introduced many new and innovative dishes while retaining longtime favorites.  The dining area itself is dominated by an enormous Buddha and classical and Asian music plays softly in the background.  We shared an appetizer of lobster cakes, cumin aioli and Thai mango chutney.  For entrees we each chose the Korean barbecue salmon over potato cake topped with a green papaya salad.  The meal was superb though our server was personality challenged.",1
1982,"I don't know why, but I'd always been reluctant to try this place.  \n\nMaybe it's because it's so close to the casino floor?  \nMaybe it's the bright colors?  \nMaybe because I kept thinking it was a Mexican restaurant, realize it wasn't when I actually *was* looking for a Mexican restaurant, and it just wasn't on my radar for steaks/meat?  \nMaybe because it's sort of in no man's land where it's too expensive for a casual meal and not really in the upper tier of fine dining restaurants on the strip?  \n\nRegardless, I finally got around to trying Mesa when it was a friend's choice for dinner.  \n\nTook a little hunting to find something that really stuck out on the menu to me.  No doubt it's just personal preference, but quite a few items on the menu seemed to have polarizing experiments, meaning they'd start off sounding great before having a deal breaker ingredient I don't care for.  I'm not usually a fan of substitutions or trying to alter a chef's creation.  \n\nWhen I did finally decide on my meal, it was very good.  Much better than I was expecting.  Portions are on the smaller side though, and I wouldn't put Mesa in the top tier of restaurants on the strip.  \n\n3.5 stars rounded up from me.",1

1984,"Normally, I wouldn't write a review about an airport. But, because it's Vegas, this airport is... uh... special.\n\nIt all started two days prior when my lady friend got pick-pocketed on the strip. I heard later that Las Vegas has the biggest crime rate of any city in America. Whether that is true or not is up to what you read, I guess, but it makes sense for this story. After contacting the airline and the police, we were told that we could make it through security, but it would be tricky, and to arrive two hours early.\n\nSo, we showed up three hours early. Being Las Vegas, it's both very hot, and very booze-soaked. I had been nauseous throughout a lot of the trip, why, I still do not know. Something to do with the heat, the eat, and the alcohol turning everything sideways.\n\nWe waited in line to have our ID's checked; both of us with single carry on bags.

He got on the phone with some mystery government official on the other end, and in a few short minutes, and after a few brief questions politely queried at the side of gate three, we were on our way. Two hours early.\n\nDue to the security hangup, the TSA supervisor allowed us to cut in line and we ended up waiting for the plane to arrive for about 2.5 hours. I took a few walks through the makeshift casinos to alleviate my sickness from the stress and other aforementioned contributing factors, but by the time we got on the plane and got in the sky, the nausea was gone, and we were home free.",0

I had to wait with my salad for a long time because I didn't have a fork....pretty weird. I felt like I was in coming to America or something. The food was completely bland.

The decorations are great, and there is plenty of Sinatra playing to further the illusion of class, but once you sit down and look at the menu, the disappointment starts flying at you.\n\nAppetizers? I think not, unless you're feeling like salad. There is salad, pizza, and wine. Also, a full bar, with beer. Not that having a simple menu is bad, it's just that when pizza is all you make, I expect mind blowing pizza. This falls flat on all levels.\n\nThe crust I'll admit was decent. Just the right amount of flavor and charring. You're getting that right. But the tomato sauce? Nothing special. Do they buy it from Safeway? The cheese? Just alright for a gourmet pizza, and certainly not enough of it. As far as toppings go, I don't like the idea of needing to order extra cheese just to have my pizza covered. Also, I feel every gourmet pizza joint of this magnitude should have proscuitto as an option. 'Ham' just isn't cutting it.\n\nDon't fret, the white pizza was okay. It used just the right amount of garlic, and had a fair balance. It was a bit on the bland side, and I would definitely have olives on that if I ever came back.\n\nBut please, Grimaldi's, spare us all your pretentiousness. No matter how many decorations (your plastic hostesses included) you put up, or how much backstory you have about NYC, you define mediocre. Don't offer me some BS wine pairing with your pizza, the only pairing it deserves is a mug of Budweiser and a Yankee's game. It's just not quality stuff. Some poor chump is going to waste $40 on a pizza and some $5 BevMo wine thinking he's dining on something amazing. Meanwhile, I'll be enjoying my meal at a place like Piazza Al Forno. Take notes.",0
1989,"FINALLY got piece back, but took almost a month of false promises, \""""almost ready, next week, k come get it, wait...not yet etc\"""" \n\nThen at the end, after all that, I don't know if he did this on purpose or was just not 'there', but did not add in the 10% 'discount' I was offered for waiting 21+ days for what I thought was a simple watch repair.   10% off that they give everyone for 21+ days of waiting and that was my bonus prize.  \n\nI could go in details about why the delays happened, or at least what I was told, but instead I will just be shopping elsewhere for my future \""""Fast-Fix\"""" watch repairs. \n\nThanks for the repair as it looks GREAT, that's where the 1 star comes in. \n\nEverything else, lol. \n\nGood luck in your future endeavors.",0
1990,"Love how they have preset portions scooped out in mini pots that you can grab.  It's a perfect size, not too much and just enough to taste, which is what all buffet goers want, a taste of everything without being full from grabbing too much in the beginning.  This buffet is smart, they are saving tons of money from those that grab too much and end up wasting a plateful of food.\n\nCame here for lunch on a weekday, no line, $23.\n\nI will have to say that some of the Asian dishes were not that great.  This may be biased since I am Asian and know what it should taste like, but I think anyone would agree.  The hai gaw (dim sum shrimp dumpling) was dry and crumbly, like it was not steamed.  The chicken adobe was dry and not edible.  \n\nCouldn't try everything, but dishes that stood out were the curries, salads and desserts.  \n\nThere is a wonderful array of desserts displayed in all colors!  So pretty and tastes just as pretty as it looks!  The desserts saved me from those horrible tasting Asian dishes.\n\nService was good.  Also loved how the water we get is served in this clean, fresh looking bottle-it tasted good too, not like tap water.",1
1991,PROS:\n1. Cheap eats!! You get your bang for your buck here. Lots of meaty & vegetarian options.\n\n2. Food is yummy. Their mango lassi is made with HOMEMADE yogurt which makes it really tasty.\n\nCONS:\n1. The silver platter thingy awkwardly sits on top of a tray.\n\nOVERALL:\n-Go here for a casual meal. I prefer this place than the indian buffet places around mtl.,1
1992,"It really hurts me to update and down grade my review, but today, was so unacceptable.\n\nI walked into BRUS today, because my husband and I have decided that it is time for our 8 month old to sleep in her own room, (her crib). I got the \""""breathable\"""" mesh bumpers at my baby shower, almost a year ago, and they haven't really worked out for two reasons.\n\n1- My crib has a solid wood panel in the back, and 2- my daughter rams her head into her crib... like she's a little bull.. she likes to sleep in corners.\n\nSo, because she is older, and the SIDS risk isn't really a factor anymore, i wanted to look around to find some normal (padded) bumpers.\n\ni believe the associate's name was Beth, and man, she was as mean as a snake.\n\nShe pretty much told me that  I would be putting my baby in danger if I put bumpers on her crib............. She \""""predicts\"""" that some states won't even sell bumpers in the future. I should contact my doctor before I buy bumpers.... Because babies can get tangled up in the bumpers.....\n\nNot really seeing how this is possible, when bumpers get tied to the crib?\n\nThen, the funny part of it is, that she has a bumper that she can sell me for $20.\n\n\nSeriously? What happened to the dangers?",0
1993,"This place is still classy, especially when compared to the nearby casinos (Circus Circus and Riviera).  The lobby and casino have that retro Vegas elegance.  The staff was very friendly, from check in, to wait staff, to the dealers.  We were there with our tween son, and we enjoyed the breakfast buffet, the casual restaurant, the Asian place and the steakhouse.  Our room (14th floor) was modern and did not look dated at all. The fitness center/spa was great to burn off the buffet calories and relax.  Note:  the \""""Strip View\"""" is not what it used to be.  The new condos block much of the view.  Next time, I'll ask for a view of the mountains and golf course on the back side.",1
1994,"I can't even comment on the food because it never came. I ordered through Grub Hub at 6:30 and they said it would be an hour. It's not 9 and still nothing. In the mean time there have been three calls to grub hub and one directly to the restaurant. Each call promised a delivery time which wasn't met. They tried blaming a little drizzle for their driver not getting here the first time, then they were slammed, then some other nonsense. On the last call to Grub Hub they said the driver was just a minute or two away and they would refund me the whole order and he would still deliver it to apologize for the wait. That was 15 minutes ago. These guys have horrible service and and always making up some bull***t excuse as to why they can't do their job. Avoid this place like the plague, as a Chicagoan, I can honestly say, no self respecting Chicago eatery would ever treat a customer like this.\n\n\nEDIT: Food finally got here 9:30.. food's cold, my soda is warm, the fries are soggy and the taste is just ok. Between the refund of my order and grubhub sending me coupons to make up for the horrible service, I was paid to eat here, and still feel like I overpayed.",0
1995,"There's a reason they are only getting one star and that's because I can't give them NONE. ABSOLUTELY THE WORST, MOST UNPROFESSIONAL COMPANY I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH. I simply called to ask questions about a vehicle because I'm out of state and I was met with rude snide people who didn't even seem to want to answer any of my very simple questions. The final straw was when I asked if it had a clean car fax and was put on hold for over 8 minutes. Simple questions folks! Selling a car isn't brain surgery. ALLOW ME TO WARN THE PUBLIC, IF YOU BUY A VEHICLE FROM THIS DEALERSHIP YOUR BUYING AT YOUR (OWN) risk. There are to many hungry dealers out there for you to have to deal with these horrible people.",0

1997,Terrible haircut. She took only about 10 minutes to cut my hair and it looked uneven. I then told her and she said that's just the way my hair was. Now I have to go back to get it fixed. I would never pay any amount to get my hair cut there again.,0
1998,"I was out and about on a Saturday night at 8pm and decided to give Vintner Grill one last chance.  It was really sad\n\n1. This place used to be packed and without reservations you couldn't get in.  Prime time Saturday evening and if was a quarter full I would be surprised.\n\n2. The vibe was bad and the employees seemed... well... beaten down.  I'm not sure what's up but unhappy employees make for a poor experience.  My guess is a change of management is in order.\n\n3. The ever present smell of old fish still permeates the air.  Even if the the ventilation system int he kitchen needs improvement... fresh fish doesn't smell that way when cooked.\n\n4.  I ate at the bar and actually had prompt and pleasant service by the only bartender - Char.  She was the saving grace of the evening.\n\n5.  I ordered the crab cake appetizer which I felt was risky based on the old fish smell.  It actually wasn't half bad but then I was into my 2nd martini when it arrived and pretty hungry.  I little too dark on the outside but didn't taste burnt but tasty.\n\nThis is my 2nd not so great review and the last review the manager wrote me privately and asked me to give them a 2nd chance.  My response was \""""why should I?\""""  but I did it anyway.  I'm sad to say if it hadn't been for Char, the whole experience would have been worse.\n\nIt's a shame such a beautiful restaurant with abundant outdoor seating that's both comfortable and lovely is clearly mismanaged and well past it's prime.  I think they are going to have to work pretty hard to pull themselves out of what seems to be disfavor and probably need to hire a restaurant consultant to get some objectivity and change staff, etc.    Perhaps Gordon Ramsey from Kitchen Nightmares can help eradicate the horrible odor and fix what ails Vintner Grill.",0
1999,"Expensive Gringo Mexican food.  Saving grace is the setting.  Wonderful pond with ducks in the middle of the facility.  Go for the beauty of it, not for the \""""Mexican\"""" food.  They seem to cater to the Cave Creek tourist \""""semi cowboy\"""" trade.",0
2000,"Fuck this place.\n\nYes, I said it and even after 6 years, I will still say it.\n\nSo the girls and I are on a tear it up Vegas weekend. All very cute and sessy gals for the record and all gals who appreciate the less than finer things in life like fake boobied strippers, over-priced drinks and titty bars. \n\nSo we cab it over to the Crazy Horse Too after hearing that THIS was THE place to go. We roll up and instantly get static at the door. You can't come in without a date. Um, okay, well we are a bunch of girls with lots of money to spend? NO! But...? NO!\n\nSo we walk a few feet away and regroup while trying to keep the temper of one Drunky MaGoo down to a manageable level since the a-hole of a door guy was especially rude to this one girl in our group. I suggest grabbing a few guys and rollin in with them. I mean who cares, we can ditch them at the door but at least it gets us in. So we latch onto said guys and walk up.\n\nDoor guy says, NO!\n\nI say, \""""You said dates, these are our dates. We are in love, let us in.\"""" (Mind you I'm drunk and his anger is amusing me at this point)\n\nDoor guy says, \""""fine you can come in, but that one stays out!\"""" (pointing to my friend)\n\nI say, \""""Come on, don't be THAT guy, did mama raise you to be THAT guy? She just really wants to see some boobs, surely you can relate.\""""\n\nApparently he couldn't, but I also think he was suffering from mama abandonment issues and clearly wasn't loved enough as a child, but I digress...\n\nHe then decides that none of us should be allowed to come in. Fine, I'd rather not go if my friend is going to not be let in, so just give us our money back and we will go spend it elsewhere, right?\n\nApparently this is when the poor chap lost all sense of hearing as i became invisible and mute in his eyes.\n\n\""""Excuse me, I said we'll go. Can you please just give us our money back?\""""\n\n\""""Hello?\""""\n\n\""""Umm\""""\n\n\""""Yo!\""""\n\nRetard Roy then starts smirking and it is quite clear that the four of us who \""""got in\"""" will not be getting our money back, even though we technically never even entered the club. \n\nI then followed up with calls to the establishment the next day that were (to no surprise) never returned. Maybe they are in cahoots with Prime Time Shuttle as their customer service seems to be pretty dead on.\n\nSo if you are a girl don't go here. If you are a guy, have at it, but why waste your money on a place that won't let cute girls in who might actually go home with you for free. Just sayin.",0
2001,"Ichiban has quickly become one of my favorite places for great food.  My work-mates and I go there at least twice a week for lunch.  Although the name implies Japanese, the owners are local Korean folk who are extremely friendly.  The food is made by them fresh, so you know it's authentic.  So what if their English is broken and hard to understand.  When it comes to the other International language, the language of food, it's easy to understand, and what they're dishin' out translates to \""""deliciousness\"""" in my stomach!  I haven't tried their sushi but their traditional Korean fare is excellent- banchan (side dishes) with home made kimchi, kalbi (beef ribs), yoo ka jang spicy soup, seafood soon du bu (seafood spicy soup) are all at the top of my list.  The prices are reasonable and the service is very friendly.  I haven't been there in the evening but my friend Suejin highly recommends it as she's spent many an evening there, happily drinking soju and sake while tabletop-grilling kalbi.  And if you know Sue like I know Sue, you know she's one tough Korean cookie to please, and Sue is always pleased when she's at Ichiban.",1
2002,"Friday nights are the busiest. Also there are coupons for 3 games that u can get from south point. The coupons for 3 games and 2 pairs of shoe rental was around $17.50.

The drinks at the lounge are little pricy, but late night happy hour rates are pretty cheap, specially for drunk bowling. \n\nI did notice that there were some glitches in the software that was tallying the score, but it only happened for one game.

2003,"not bad, but we had major issues.  If not for the good price and nice quality of the room, I would have given it one star.  LVH (formerly the Las Vegas Hilton) is definitely not a Hilton.  It was old, run-down in most parts, but the room we got was newly renovated and even comfortable when you first walk in.  But then later you find it has issues.  \n\nWe had an initial problem that we had our neighboring room smoking, and their smoke got into our room.  Terrible when you are trying to sleep at 2 am or 3 am and your room is full of smoke and noise.\n\nThe other big problem is that the walls are paper thin.  You can hear conversations and noise from all around.  I could hear kids crying outside, the couple in the room next to us arguing and crying, it was strange and uncomfortable.  And the pool looked totally dirty.  So many people, you can hardly find a place to sit around or even stand in the pool.  It's not relaxing at all, but seemed most people were not there for relaxing, more to party.\n\nNot a good hotel and I was very disappointed.",0

2007,"I arranged to have my company's Holiday dinner at FIX.  What a big mistake it was.  We had a big group of over 30 people, they arranged to have us sit in round tables joined together, some had 4 people, others had 5 or 6 people.  While the food was sub-par at best, the service was the worst I have ever experienced.   It started during appetizer when each plate had 4 pieces of flat bread.  The servers didn't bother to make sure that tables with 5 or 6 people had enough for everyone, so I had to flag them down to ask.  When the main course was served, the steak came before the steak sauce, and some tables were missing steak sauce.  As the host, I was expecting the waiters and waitresses to take care of making sure my guests were well taken care of.  Instead, I had to run from table to table to make sure everyone had enough sauce. Needless to say, this wasn't the only problem.  The side dishes (mashed potatoes and cream spinach) were so small I manage to get 1 teaspoon of it, and there was hardly enough for my table of 4.  I had to complain, and the waitress brought out 1 extra side for my entire party.  The same thing happened at dessert.  Some tables got their \""""doughnut\"""" desserts, other's did not.  I had to run around again, bringing extra desserts from one table to another.   After complaining to the waitress that I want to speak to the manager, it took an employee of mine to finally get the Assistant General Manager to come over to talk to me.  \n\nIn any decent restaurant, my experience would have resulted in a discount, a reduction in service fees, or at least some sort of compensation to make up for the bad service, but all I heard from him was he was \""""sorry\"""".  \n\nI will never host another group event at any of the MGM properties or restaurant again because of this bad experiences.  FIX needs some serious fixing.  The manager should be fired for the inability to supervise, and the servers need much more training. The food is over priced, and for the $600+ in gratuities they charged me (compulsory for large groups), I was expecting far better service than this.\n\nThe atmosphere was horrible.  You can smell cigarette smoke coming in from the casino, and the sound was so LOUD I couldn't hear anything the person sitting across from me was saying without them having to shout.\n\nAVOID THIS RESTAURANT FOR LARGE GROUPS!",0

2010,"What happened Yama? Your quality took a nose dive off a cliff into a heap of mediocrity and bad sushi rice. \n\nI used to love this place and made a point to come here every time I visited Vegas. For  under $30, AYCE sushi rolls is tough to top, and I guess something had to finally give at Yama. The quality truly is noticeably worse and the rolls are now stuffed with a higher rice to fish ratio. To make matters worse, even the sushi rice quality seemed to have declined as both the texture and flavor are subpar. \n\nOn prior visits, I would have given Yama four stars, but based on my most recent visit, I can't give it more than two. Hopefully, they bounce back and I can edit this review later.",0

We started with the charcuterie and Foie Gras-both we're mind blowing!  Our mains included the salmon, short rib, and lamb.  It's impossible to capture the expert preparation and presentation of each dish, leave it to say each dish was savored and enjoyed.  Deserts included the Bouchon Brownies, Lemon tart and bread pudding.  If you're in Las Vegas, make dining at Bouchon a priority!  You won't be disappointed!",1
2012,"I took advantage of the travelzoo offer and only paid a little over $230 for 3 nights.  The yelp reviews pretty much cover everything about the hotel.  The buffet, service, housekeeping, rooms, etc. were great.  \n\nThe casino is not big nor small.  There is $5 blackjack and roulette at certain days and times.  There were a few areas in the casino where it was still under construction.  I can tell there were problems with the atm/cash redemption machine because I encountered one of them where it did not spit out enough money.  The supervisor was running from one atm/cash redemption machine to another to fix the situations.\n\nAs for the restaurants, I did try the Red Cup Cafe and the Studio B buffet.  The buffet exceeded my expectations and I think is one of the best.  Take advantage of the player's card as it gives you a few dollars off the buffet.  I ate at the Red Cup Cafe to satisfy my late 2am appetite.  I expected a mediocre taste in the meal from Red Cup Cafe, but was slightly above that.  \n\nExpect high winds in this area, which can make it uncomfortable to lay poolside.

2013,"Having eaten my way through most of the AYCE sushi places in Vegas, I can say that some definitely shine bright (more creative rolls, better fish selection, etc), but Sushi-mon wins every time in overall value, consistency and freshness.\n\nAdmittedly, I have history here, so this review may be somewhat biased. I've been coming here since the advent of AYCE sushi in this town. Though I've ventured off to try other places, I somehow always find myself back here. It sort of has a \""""Cheersish\"""" vibe for me.\n\nThe main reason I love it here is that I know I will get fresh, consistent product. I have never received anything less than that. At a lot of places in town, you may receive old or frozen fish which is very disconcerting. Sushi-mon somehow always has beautifully fresh fish. \n\nIn addition, they are FAST! I order something (in most cases, LOTS of things) and it's on the table in 5 minutes. Sushi-mon chefs seem to get a kick out of the people who order ridiculous amounts of food, so they send it out as quick as they can. \n\nSpeaking of the staff, they are as friendly as can be. Fransisco is my \""""go-to\"""" server and he always takes care of us. Paul, the busser/runner, knows us well too and always keeps our drinks filled and our table clean. \n\nBut on to the food...\n\nAs I said, we usually order our fair share of nigiri: hamachi, garlic tuna, aji, hirame, hotate with yuzu...but our favorites are the hokkigai (surf clam) and sake (salmon). I've never had surf clam as fresh and delicious as theirs. If you've tried surf clam somewhere else and hated it, try it here. Trust me.\n\nThe rolls are no joke as well. Some favorites are the Yebisu, Stacey and Hurricane roll, but I've yet to try one I didn't like. Another tip: you can get most rolls in \""""hand roll\"""" form. I like to get yumyum scallops, california and spider rolls that way. Also, try some baked green mussels. They're creamy and briny, yet sweet and unctuous. If you're still hungry after all that, get the Frying Jason roll. It's delicious, but it'll put you over the edge. Their side dishes (miso soup, tempura shrimp, sesame chicken, calamari) are terrific as well. \n\nOk. That's enough. This review is making me hungry.

2019,"Windsor is hands down one of my favorite places to go to in all of Arizona.  The Backyard Burger and the Pastrami Reuben are both delicious but my personal favorite is the Porkwich and as a guy... I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.  When I first discovered Windsor earlier this year, the Porkwich was the menu item that caught my eye as unique and a must try.  For the longest time, I had a difficulty trying other menu items because I enjoyed the sandwich so much.  Stepping out of your comfort zone and being adventurous is a good thing because they have other excellent menu items as well.  The Porkwich is still my guilty pleasure.\n\nWindsor is part of the Upward Projects group who also own Postino's and Federal Pizza (both of which are amazing restaurants in their own way).  Windsor is an excellent establishment for both their food, bar, service, and atmosphere.  Inside where the bar is, there is a wall full of cassette tapes on a side wall.  Definitely cool.  They play great music in the restaurant / bar area and the atmosphere is definitely cool, the reason why the place is enjoyable.  Outside is a very laid back lounge / outdoor dining area with a fireplace.  Great food... fun and enjoyable atmosphere, what more could you want?  Oh yeah!  The reason why my brother loves this place is because they have a great liquor menu and I'm pretty sure the bartenders are amazing enough to make something complicated too if that's your thing.",1

The craps dudes were all fun, gave good advice and were all around fun (well, except Glen...he was a bit of a hardass.)  I really had an awesome time here.  I won't be staying at the hotel anytime soon after reading the other yelp reviews tho I highly recommend going to throw your money down at the casino.",1
2024,"I took my Yelp friend Irene V. here the other day to get a pedicure with me and I was not surprised when she said she loved the place!  \nSigh, I'd let you in on my secret haven. Imagine the Barber Shop, that the kind of place this is in real life. Place is clean, unpretentious and the price extremely reasonable. There are two ladies there who does the pedi and mani. A spa pedi is $22 (only!) and a gel French manicure is $25 (only!). I have been going to Traci but both Traci and Eva will do a fantastic job. \nThey also have hair cut, coloring, lash extension, and facial services. \nWhat I mean though about it being like the Barber Shop is that I do on occasion go in to shoot the breeze with the ladies. Both of them are extremely nice and friendly and we will sit around and chat as though we're sitting on a front porch somewhere waving our fans, having lemonade. \nThere you have it- the best kept secret and my safe haven has been yelped!!!\nWell, guess these ladies are so nice and so great- everyone should know about them. Except of course when I want to get my nails done or go in for a chat!!!!",1
2025,"Let me start off by saying I wanted to LOVE this spa experience.  My Husband and I stayed at the Westin after our wedding and it holds centimental value for us, so when we were in need of a spa day recently the Westin was our first choice.  We booked the Travelzoo massage in advance and were greeted promptly upon our arrival.  Everything seemed to go well with check-in and we were shown to our respective locker rooms.  I didn't find the actual facilities to be anything special.  It had all the basic things and seemed a-ok.  Honestly, I don't even remember it well and that was less than a month ago.\n\nNow, the massage.  I have to say this in one of, if not the worst, massages I have ever had.  I asked for \""""medium\"""" pressure and got the massage of my nightmares.  She was so aggressive I thought I was going to be pushed right through the table.  It was awful, painful, and the complete opposite of relaxing. I spent most of the time wondering when it will be over.  I thought to myself this must be an annomoly, but NO, my Husband had the exact same experience.  He even asked his massuse to let up, but she didn't.  We both walked away more than disappointed.  Afterwards we hung out by the spa pool, which was nice and quiet compared to the main pool area.  Service was OK... honestly the best part of the whole day was the boneless buffalo wings and bannana smoothie.  Those were to die for.\n\nUpon reflection, I realized we never got our mimosa or foot massage as part of the Travelzoo package.  Just another disappointment, but I didn't even care to bring it to anyone's attention.  I really enjoy hitting up local spas during the summer and thanks to Travelzoo I usually get them at a good price for the quality.  This time, anything over $1 was too much for this spa experience.  To say we were disappointed is the understatement of the year.  We won't be back.",0
2026,"So bummed.  In the afternoon, my husband and I were walking by on our way to see the gardens.  I saw a couple having coffee and cookies.  After viewing the gardens, the thought of a relaxing cup of coffee was stuck in my head.  We went back to the lounge and found a seat right away.  We were served after sitting down.  We just ordered coffees.  They were served in a timely manner.  This is where time stopped and good times were no more.  The first sip that hit my tongue was like warm coffee water.  So sad.  Then, we sat and drank bad coffee.  We never saw our server again, until we stood up to leave.  Then, we finally got our bill and couldn't charge it to our room because she didn't leave a pen and ran away too quickly.  Sad again.  We left a note (after getting a pen from the hostess) commenting on the bad service and weak, overpriced coffee.  We won't be back.",0
2027,"Without a doubt some of the most delicious Mexican food I have ever eaten. It's kind of like Roberto's for people who somewhat care about their health and aren't housed out of their minds at 4:00 in morning. Their tacos are small, but tasty. The nachos aren't deep-fried and are loaded with fresh meat of your choice (I prefer chicken) and other equally fresh ingredients (only I wish they'd use less sour cream sometimes). The only drawback is they are not open 24/7. Still, go here if you want to save yourself money as well as calories. Also, they serve Mexican beer which is always nice to have with a meal.",1
2028,"This is a long overdue review, but after having attempted to slow grill my own ribs over weekend, I decided I needed to show appreciation for one of the masters in town.\n\nWhen I first noticed the funky little box of a building on Indian School a little over a year ago, I wasn't sure what it was, let alone what to expect.  After walking in to the no-frills and being ignored for a bit, I was ready to walk out.  I'm glad I changed my mind.\n\nYes the service can be a bit slow and some times appear surely, and the decor is bare bones... but this is because they are dedicated to putting all their energy into producing the finest bbq this side of the Kansas. One can imagine places like this spread out through along the highways and small towns in the mid-west and southern states, packed with BBQ loving locals.  Once you get to the counter and get down to the business of placing your order, the service is extremely friendly and helpful (especially for a Canadian transplant, who didn't know the first thing about real BBQ culture)\n\nAfter getting my order home, all I could say is FAN-TAS-TIC. Smoky, tender pork ribs slathered in an amazing barbecue sauce --  sweet, with a deep yet subtle 'tang'. Frankly, I don't remember what sides I ordered, as i was lost in the meat, saucy goodness.\n\nOverall, a great experience, and while I've yet to return, I will be back one of these days.  After having tried Stacy's, all I can say is I'm a BBQ convert.  Since that fateful day, I've been busy checking out other BBQ joints as well as perfecting my own sauces and techniques (which has given me a deeper appreciation for the mastery of what Stacey and his staff do).  I'll be back.",1
2029,"Caught a quick bite to eat here the other day while staying at the Encore.  Absolutely delicious food!  As I found out during my stay at the Encore, the food at all of the establishments were amazing.  Service was great.  I would not recommend for date night as it is a little more open and not as private or contains a great ambiance.  But the food was delectable and I would definitely return.  Stop by for lunch!",1
2030,"Went back again....this time for their famous blueberry pecan french toast. It was just like bread pudding...light, fluffy and extremely delicious. I was only able to get through about 1/2 of it. The kids chowed down on their usual cinnamon crunch french toast. We also had a lovely chat with the manager, Steve Bell. Super cool guy and was great with my kids (my daughter loved him). He was very helpful when I asked him questions about their gluten free options (my mom suffers from Celiac disease). We will be back very soon...this time with mom/grammy in tow. Thanks again Steve:)",1
2031,"Figured I'd give this place another chance. Friend wanted some furniture and i needed a new bed. Paid in cash for a new bed. They didn't want to deliver to my place. My friend still wanted his bed. I figured i would just rent my own truck and transport his and mine and save money anyways. After getting everything organized, and showing up at the store bright and early, the lady tells me we need to go to the warehouse. Not during the 2 hour process did anyone say i needed to go to the warehouse. My friend agreed. No one said that. Only a few miles away, no big deal. Inconvenient and costing me per mile in the rented truck but....anyways. Go to the warehouse, pick up the beds, drop them off, drop off the truck and get home to crash on my new bed...only problem...it's the wrong bed. Congratulations! This company just made my list for never again.",0
2032,"Not happy to write a negative review about this place. I was really excited to try it because it's in a great location, got great reviews and has outdoor seating! The reason I gave two stars instead of one is because the waitress we had was really wonderful, attentive and friendly. \nSadly, the sushi was very disappointing. I don't know if it's because we were there in the afternoon, it was just a bad day for the chef, or this is just how it always is. It was like they had to add a large amount of sauce (chili sauce, eel sauce, etc) to compensate for the rolls not tasting very good. The sauces overpowered any other flavor and to me, the sauces tasted...for lack of a better term...cheap-y? For example, the chili sauce on one of our rolls tasted like Ketchup. Yuck. And let me tell you, I was really trying to like this place.\nAlso, so weird. We got sake bombs, which were $5 (awesome!). Sadly, and weirdly, the sake tasted like fried food! I don't know if their sake sits close to their fryer, or what, but it was so gross. Luckily you could ALMOST cover the flavor by mixing it with beer, but it was still hard to drink.\nAll in all, I am sad to say I will not be going back. The best part was the service, which was also probably because there weren't many people there when we were.",0
2033,"Another Fox restaurant...yawn. \n  We started out on a bad note when we took a seat at the bar to wait for our table. The bar was really cool looking and we loved the idea of using green apples as paperweights. The selection of wine and beer was really decent for a place with a limited menu. The bartender, however, poured us pathetically small glasses of wine. It would have been ok if it appeared to be consistent, but we saw several glasses going out to tables that were much fuller. They weren't exorbitantly priced glasses, but I still want what I'm paying for!\n  Next, the food. The zucchini fries were bland and fell apart, but the sauce that they came with was pretty tasty. The truffle fries were lacking in a good truffle flavor. Some of the fries in the basket were soggy and some were burnt. We sent most of them back. The veggie burger was super good. Just about one of the best veggie burgers I've ever tasted, surprisingly. The report from the ahi burger was \""""ok\"""". The report from the Zinburger was \""""ok and undercooked according to my order\"""". The sweet potato fries were delicious. \n  The service was good. Elizabeth busted her butt to get us everything we needed, despite the clear lack of organization in the rest of the restaurant: The place had cleared out considerably by the time we ordered, and it still took about 30 minutes to get our food!\n  As with most Fox Concepts, it's all concept and no substance. From most of the other reviews, I don't expect a long wait for tables in this place the very near future.",0
2034,Love this place! This is a new location that is in a perfect place for me by the mall. The people are always welcoming and remembered me after I came in a few times in a week because I can't get enough!! Their sauce is the best. My friends and I meet there on a regular basis now.:) Thank you canes!!,1
2035,"Well, I pretty much love NYPD Pizza. Calzones are my favorite. I've been ordering the Frank Sinatra with various fillings for years. Absolutely adore the Ricotta and I was extremely happy when they introduced the small size...which is still big enough for 2 meals. I do enjoy the pizza but in my personal opinion, it's better as takeout and then being baked again in your oven...I prefer it a little crispier, pretty much always get pepperoni and basil...occasionally throwing in pineapple. Also get ranch with everything...I'm not huge on ranch but I would bathe in the ranch from NYPD Pizza. The cheesy garlic knots are also phenomonal!",1
2036,It was my family and I first time here and let me tell you it was the worse service ever!!!!!!!!!!!!! Never again will we walk into this restaurant again!!! Service was bad from beginning to end even the manager scott didn't do his job. after his employees screwed up our order.............. LIKE I SAID NEVER AGAIN AND I HOPE ANYONE THAT GOES IN THE NEAR FUTURE DOESNT HAVE THE EXPERIENCE ME AND MY FAMILY HAD.,0
2037,"The Atmosphere: Dark, modern, but welcoming. There are about ninety elevated flat screens, with every game and the omnipresent SportsCenter. The bar area is spaced out very well, so everyone is not right on top of one another. The bar is a good size wrap around type.\n\nThe Service: Excellent. Each time I've been in I've received personal service from friendly wait staff or bartenders. The managers greet customers as well, and the staff seems to be a great team.\n\nThe Food: Good. Nothing mind blowing, but above average. Fresh meat, good sauces, and good veggies. You don't come here for a culinary experience anyway, but you'll leave full and happy. \n\nThe Drinks: Good prices even outside of happy hour. Small tap selection, but this is Gilbert. They have chilled mugs, which is cool. \n\nOverall: Blue 32 exceeds my expectations whenever I go in. All in all, it provides a cool sports bar contrast to the pub next door.",1
2038,"I come here a lot for smoothies, but have never tried the food here, so we decided today was the day that we'd try one of their wraps...boy what a mistake that was. I ordered 2 smoothies and a Jamaican jerk wrap. The smoothies came out about 5 min after I ordered them, at which point I sat down and figured the food would take a while longer to make...\n\n20 min later and they still haven't called my name, and I started noticing customers that ordered after us being called up to get their food orders, which was not a good sign. I went up to the counter to ask about my order and when the employee saw my receipt, she had a confused look upon her face and rushed to the back to check the order screen. She never came back and appeared to be rushing to make my order. Then another employee approaches the counter to see what was wrong and acknowledged that I had been waiting a while. I told her I had been waiting 20 min and still didn't have my order. I asked her for a refund if my wrap hadn't been made yet, since we had to get back to work, and she immediately took 7 bucks and some change out of the register and handed it to me.\n\nLong story short, we waited 20 min and had to go back to work with no food in hand. This place is great for smoothies but I would recommend staying away from the food orders because you'll be waiting a while, if you even get anything at all!",0
2039,"The staff at Urbana Tire Company have always been very friendly, knowledgeable, and incredibly helpful.\n\nThey always provide real timely service at an affordable price and they don't give you the run-around with repair costs or deadlines.\n\nThey are located close enough to downtown Urbana that if you drop off your car you can take a peaceful stroll down Main street, maybe stop by the book store, or drop into any one of the dining/drinking establishments to have a cool beverage and a tasty bite to eat while your car gets fixed.",1
2040,"This new restaurant in Fountain Hills is well worth the trip.  The best Chinese food anywhere!  The restaurant offers great atmosphere and a very pleasant, welcoming staff.  Great for groups, lunch or dinner.  The food is out of this world.  Everything is extremely fresh and our favorite place to go.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!",1
2041,"I will never, I repeat NEVER visit this establishment again. After receiving a gift card for discounted dining offers, I confirmed on the internet that this place would honor the card.  I decided to take my son there to eat. They advised me that they would NOT honor the card AFTER they served us soup and our drinks. The total for that nonsense was 3.62. I was told that I needed cash and they wouldn't run my credit card for under 5.00. I promptly advised the woman that if she wanted to get paid for the bill, she would run my card for the 3.62 they were charging me, I would NOT be purchasing anything else from them to make up the difference. RUDE! I also contacted the Entertainment card customer service department as to find out why the discount wasn't accepted and to let them know that I am hesitant to try to use the card again. I will go to Panda Express next time. At least I can understand the people who work there while they are trying to screw me.",0
2042,"I agree with Sean, as a Chicago native every good 'street food' type joint has the hot dog statue outside and the sports posters and stuff lining the walls.\nToday saw me ordering a gyro and I really would not recommend this as a gyro place.  The pita was good enough, but the meat was weird-dry and VERY lemony...tzatziki would hold it's own I suppose but the meat totally took away from the experience.  Seven bucks for a gyro and small pop.  Take that for what it's worth..........\nI've eaten lunch here previously and I thought the beef sandwiches were okay, not great by any means but I'd order a beef sandwich way before the gyros should I lose my mind and patronize this establishment again.",0
2043,"This place is a complete and utter disappointment. If you're a Vegas local living in the Green Valley area you're probably excited a place comparable to Insert Coins has opened up on your side of town. This could not be further from the truth. If you're coming here for the arcade games be prepared to be disappointed. This is NOT Insert Coins. Not even close.\n\nMy experience was also highlighted by a security guard interrupting the conversation I was having to tell me to make sure the sandals I was wearing were all the way on my feet! I was sitting on a stool and one of my sandals (apparently?) was not on my foot all the way. Now, I'm all about hygiene, cleanliness, and for following the rules, but this guy was extremely rude. How about tending to the line out the door, or the drunk guy at the bar, instead of worrying about my sandal. \n\nTo top it off, the arcade area isn't even 21 and over. There's nothing worse than jockeying for position and trying to enjoy drinks with friends while trying to fend off 18-year old hipsters trying to play Pac-Man and Golden Tee. Yes, there is a 21-over bar area attached, but at this point I might as well head to PT's. \n\nI did not taste the food so I can't speak to their menu, but as far as the bar/arcade portion goes...my advice is to stay away. There are far better places in Vegas to check out on a weekend evening.",0
2044,This place is wonderful. I'm kind of a waffle snob. I hate going to places like IHOP or Dennys and getting a waffle which is nothing but a waffle shaped pancake. The waffles here are crisp on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. Just the way of waffle is supposed to be. \n\nThe staff is always extremely friendly. There are times when they get busy that it's a little slower than others but overall not bad. The bacon is great. The waffle sandwiches are good and even their waffle pizzas are good. My daughters love their chocolate smoothies. This is a fun place to go and take the kids. They can order a waffle with ice cream and whip cream and chocolate syrup and fun stuff like that.\n\nThe next time you think of going over to cracked egg or IHOP and waiting for an hour to be seated head over to waffles cafe instead. You will be pleasantly surprised.,1
2045,"Great experience!! I stumbled into Creating Magic after searching for a nail salon on Yelp. The owner, Barb, is so sweet and extremely talented and careful with nail care. I originally came in for a gel mani/pedi but stayed for a \""""Lainie cut\"""" by hair stylist Lainie. She managed to transform my very thick hair into light, bouncy, layers that I love!! I moved to Phoenix a year ago and have been searching for my go to salon ever since, I found it at Creating Magic!",1
2046,"Great to finally have another place on North Tryon! Love it here. Big menu, great food, friendly service. My faves are their breakfast sandwiches and the Reubens. Comfortable seating inside, nice patio seating with a good view of Tryon. I've lived next door for almost ten years, this is a great addition to the area!",1
2047,"I actually found this place.. through a menu left on my door. Usually I throw those away on the spot.. but I do have an interest in different Asian Style foods. So i gave it a try. I was very please with what I ordered the first time.. which was duck wraps and curry noodles. I didn't know what to get so I went with what I like and I was pleased. Since then I have ordered from this place a couple more times. I have tried a few different dishes.. the delivery of the food is always hot and comes in about 30 minutes for me.. \n\nUpon reading other reviews I will be ordering again and trying the recommended dishes. Give it a shot. Its good stuff. \n\nP.S. I was a bit more than slightly impressed with the fact that they remembered that I am one of only 2 people in my housing area that orders from them.. it was nice for the recognition. The young lady that answers teh phone is very cordial and helpful. I'm just saying.. it's nice to get good service, even on a take-out order!",1
2048,"Horrible place!!!  Went on a Tuesday night about 12:00am.  Stayed for about an hour.  My bros and I dropped $170 and didn't see one topless girl.  Place was empty. Nasty girls sat in our lap, argued about price and left pissed off that we wouldn't pay $400 for a lap dance.  One guy in my party gave each of them a $20 for their time.  They were still pissed.  No one danced on stage.  Place sucked big time...don't waste your time!",0
2049,"I'm not a huge fan of the food at the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus, but it has the best beer in town and an atmosphere that can't be duplicated. (Unless, perhaps, you're in Bavaria. And even there, I doubt you'll hear a guy mixing traditional German songs with reggae and the \""""Hogan's Heroes\"""" theme song.)\n\nMy husband and I met some friends for lunch on a Saturday. We arrived at noon, and the place was nearly empty. By the time we left at 1:30, however, the place was rocking, no doubt due to the entertainment (a one-man band) that began at 1. It was also extremely loud, so if you're looking to have an intimate meal, this is NOT your place! If you're looking for a good, raucous time, give the Haus a whirl.\n\nAs I said, the food is not the draw here; it's the beer. We each had a liter of the Oktoberfest, which is a nice, smooth lager. As much a I enjoyed this seasonal offering (and it was the main reason we all decided to meet here for lunch), I was craving the Hofbr\u00e4u Original, so I got myself a 0.5-liter mug as well. So tasty! And so pricey -- $17 for the Oktoberfest, and $8 for the Original. (Hey, I said it was tasty. I didn't say it was cheap!)\n\nMy friends split a jumbo pretzel, complete with sides of mustard, cheese spread, and liver pate. At around $17.50, this was one expensive appetizer. Although they enjoyed their app, my husband and I skipped straight to the entrees. I had the beer sausage (a bratwurst), which was on \""""special\"""" for $16, and he had his old standby, the leberk\u00e4se, which is like an upscale grilled Spam loaf. (Sounds bad, but it's oh so good.) My friends had the beer sausage and the giant bratwurst sandwich, and they split of piece of Black Forest cake for dessert. Total damage for lunch (pre-tip): $190. Eek!\n\nThere are two dining rooms in the building, and we've sat in both of them. On this occasion, the smaller, indoor beer garden was closed, so we sat in the large beer hall up front. There's usually some sort of entertainment going on, and at night this place can get REALLY loud -- especially during the popular keg-tapping events. So be forewarned. And you'll probably drop a lot of money, if our lunch bill is any indication. But if you're in the mood for a semi-authentic German experience (albeit by Vegas standards), the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus is the place to go.",1
2050,"Hot reviews made us want to check it out.  Didn't disappoint.  Started with the old standard of calamari, well seasoned, served steaming hot--great way to begin.  The wine we started with wasn't great (probably not decanted) and our server was very gracious about bringing a nice replacement vintage.  We couldn't decide on sharing one pizza, so we ordered 3 NY Style Thin Crust.  The Big Apple, carnivores take note--lighter on the sauce and cheese, enabling your taste buds to enjoy the savory meat (unlike PH meat lovers pie).  The Clam, if you can't decide betdween a white pizza or clam linguine, get this one.  The BBQ Chicken, don't get this one, it just didn't make the cut due to the choice of sauce and cheese used.  We ordered the \""""small\"""" pizzas for $12 each and we all took boxes home--this was a good deal.  The service, atmosphere, and decent pizza made us decide to come back and try other goodies.",1
2051,"I've been here several times now. The first time I came was just to look at some bikes after getting completely blown off by the Vegas Harley dealership on Rainbow and ignored. Everyone was polite, helpful, answered my questions, and generally gave me a good feeling about the place. That was back in March of this year. I got an email the other day for a special zero % financing deal for 2014 models and older, so I called in to see if they would apply this to the Gunner, the model I had been looking for, even though it's 2015. I was told on the phone that this would be no problem, and when could I come in. After driving there, I'm given the old bait and switch and told that the financing deal doesn't apply to the Gunner after all. I had mentioned that I'd been battling between the Judge and the Gunner, so I'm shown the Judge, sit on it, and the salesman tells me that it's 1k off PLUS zero % financing for 5 years PLUS a 5 year warranty. Add my 1k veteran discount to that and it's a deal too good to pass up. I pick a couple add on's I want put on the bike, do the credit check paperwork, and end up sitting in the office to sign my final papers. So the bike, as it had been explained to me initially, should have been $11,999, plus whatever extras I put on, which was about $1500 bucks worth. The paperwork in front of me says 21k. Now some of this is due to my own naivete I admit, not realizing I'd be charged fees for the dealer putting the bike together or installation of the extras I wanted. My assumption was that since I was buying there then whatever I wanted put on there, labor would be included. I'm not dinging them for that at all. But the guy who did the signing did inform me that it was 1k off the bike OR zero percent financing for 5 years, not both. Now I've been baited and switched and directly lied to. Whether this was intentional or due to ignorance on the salesman's part I'm not sure, nor do I particularly care. It pissed me off. Then there's a $2500 fee in there for a 3 year warranty. I ask some questions, and I'm still not clear on what all it covers. I never got a printed list or anything like that to show me. I wasn't asked about it, it wasn't explained before, it was just there in the total. I feel that was a bit unethical. I start getting a bad feeling, worse than I already had about dealing with these guys in the future after I've made the purchase if that's how business is done. So I decide I want to think things over, consider my options, and make a decision after taking the time to properly evaluate everything. The guy doing the signing asks if there's anything he can do, he was obviously disappointed but was still polite and courteous. He offered to buy some of my gear, helmet, gloves, jacket, in order to get the sale. I told him I'd take a look at the place he recommended I go to because the stock in this office is limited. I did, and back home I went. Now, two days straight, I've been called by the salesman asking me to buy the bike. I spoke to him today, and told him I'm thinking about it, I need time to consider everything, I'm shopping for insurance, looking for basic rider courses ( I haven't done that yet ), and that sort of thing. Today is Saturday, the dealership is closed on Sunday. He asks if I can come in Monday and buy it. Now this is the same guy who, intentionally or not, gave me a bait and switch and then either lied or was misinformed about the total deal I'd be getting. Now after explaining that I wanted to think about it, I'm getting pushed hard to buy. I am sure that I will go to another dealership after this and give someone else my money. Sorry guys, I hate writing poor reviews about businesses, but I hate having bad experiences as well. I left out names because if anyone from the dealership reads this, you'll know who I am and you'll know who dealt with me. No need for me to put that up where everyone else can see.",1
2052,"Our group of 8 had a very positive experience with this company. Our limo driver was early picking us up from the airport and was extremely friendly, there was decent, chilled champagne waiting for us, and they were again right on time to pick us up from the hotel at the end of our trip. Also, since we rented an Escalade SUV package for 8 people, it was very spacious and comfortable while still being a reasonable priced way to get to and from the airport. I would recommend it if you can get a good deal from their website.",1
2053,"I had very limited choices here in this plaza when my friend wanted to stop at El Pollo Loco (which I won't eat). It was that, Subway or Qdoba. \n\nHaving had good experiences with Qdoba in Seattle/Bellevue, I figured I'd just give it a try. (I'm not much of a fan of Subway either, tbh.) \n\nI went in, walked up to the counter and waited... and waited more... About 5 minutes passed and I still haven't been served because the annoying employee is having social time with either a friend or obnoxious customer over at the register, babbling on and on about how he's in school and blahblahblah. 'Scuze me? A little service down here?\n\nOf course, after a few minutes I gave the employee the patented Condi Rice \""""stink-eye\"""", and I'm glad I did, because this place has a big ol' B grade for their health department grade. Ew.\n\nI did an about face and walked right out, wishing the next guy in line luck with actually getting some service. \n\nI'd give 0 if I could, but +1 stars because the ignorant, incompetent employee's behavior caused me to notice the B grade, and realize that I probably don't want to be eating at this location.",0
2054,"Took a while to get a hostess to seat us; maybe she was on break. But on a busy Saturday night, they should've had the front covered...

How could you go wrong? And, mmmm it was full of meaty goodness!\nMy husband had fish n chips with a side of bachelor's peas.

Their breakfast burrito is amazing.\n\nI really like the decor... it's mod and minimalist, without being over the top. \n\nAlso they have alot of GF (gluten free) menu items, which is a +. And they have their signature lemonade drinks available with Stevia. ++",1

I can't wait to swing by and check out their lunch menu.",1
2057,"This place IS really GREAT except for one thing that some people like. THE NOISE! We almost left, it was so noisy we couldn't have a conversation and neither of us could hear the drink special from our waitress. The noise level did get better towards the middle of our stay I guess if you are there during the happy hour you might hit them when they are busy and noisy.\n\nHowever\n\nThe food was good, I started with a little romaine salad it was only $3. it was good except for the apple slices that tasted like onions (that might mean something wasn't cleaned). My roasted salmon was delicious and came over a cold quinoa salad. I was surprised to find out they use high quality Scottish Salmon that only better restaurants use. \n\nMy companion had the cheese flat bread and the Pork Chile Verde and was pleased.\n\nWe spent much less here on dinner than we would have spent at many other places having a similar meal.\n\nI do plan to return but will wait for a patio seat where dining is much more pleasant.",1

2072,"Have you often wondered why so many middle-aged  Japanese people here in Las Vegas always tell you that they go to SUSHI ON RAINBOW for sushi instead of the multi-million dollar bankrolled sushi restaurants like Kabuto or Goyemon? Why do these former or current Japanese nationals prefer to eat at an older sushi bar that doesn't have fancy or exciting d\u00e9cor? The answer is that SUSHI ON RAINBOW to MANY of us people of Japanese descent is actually a symbol of pride for our community. And, the owner is a very respected man to us Japanese-Americans.\n\nWhen I was a little kid in Southern California, I first heard about Shogo-san and the famous sushi restaurant in Newport Beach. Sushi just did not exist in the area. Everytime a sushi restaurant poped up, it would quickly go out of business. Remember that sushi, and the idea of eating raw fish was not accepted by the American mainstream back then. The sushi bar that Shogo worked at was the only sushi bar in the area that had made it. Japanese people would drive 50+ miles just to eat there. Shogo-San was one of the 1st generation sushi chefs, along with the famous Ichiro Mashita who came to America from Japan with a dream to one day popularize sushi in America. They had to endure so much hardships during those days, but like most Japanese and Asian-Americans during that era, they fought hard to find success in the land of opportunity. Today, there is a Sushi bar on every street due to their labor. So, when I found out that Shogo had purchased SUSHI ON RAINBOW from the original owner, I was ecstatic! A great legend of California Sushi was now here in Las Vegas! This was a dream come true. \n\nShogo-san has over 40 years of Sushi experience. During his youth in Kyushu, he was a very respected edo style sushi chef. Went through years of apprenticeship before he even get the opportunity to the touch the actual fish. Today, his years of experience really shows. Though the majority of his day revolves around making California Rolls for westerners, there is also a \""""secret menu\"""" for those who appreciate real sushi. What I love is how every week they got something different. I've had an Edo Chirashizushi, Shinko, Engawa, a Uni-Ika mix, Maguro no Zuke, Yamaimo, and many other traditional Japanese dishes that aren't in any other J-restaurant in town. Every time I eat here I feel even more proud to have Japanese blood in my veins. \n\nUnlike most sushi bars in LV, SUSHI ON RAINBOW get's all it's items from true Japanese and Japanese-American distributors. The fish is from a real Japanese seafood distributor(not a Korean distributor), that get's their fish from cold waters such as Canada, and Alaska. Fish from colder waters will have meat that has more of that fatty marbling that we enjoy so much. Even the Japanese ice creams(plum wine, green tea) come from a famous Japanese ice cream company in Torrance.  \n\nIf you are a true sushi lover, the 1st thing you will notice is how Shogo's nigiri technique is unrealistically perfect compared to the other Sushi joints in town. Remember that he has had over 40 years experience. You will see immediately that even the chefs at Kabuto don't have his precision. And the funniest thing is that Shogo is very humble + modest and doesn't even brag about how great he is.\n\nThere used to be a guy named Hiro-san who worked here who was also a former edomaezushi chef from Japan.  Holy crap, that guy was like the best chef I had ever seen. But, he retired a few months ago. That totally depressed the hell out of me. \n\nKyuu-chan is their new apprentice sushi chef. He is of Chinese descent but he makes a lot of Japanese chefs look like amateurs due to his amazing talent. Shogo is such a a hardcore Japanese man, that he made Kyuu learn how to speak Japanese to be a chef here. He also made the Latino cooks in the back learn Japanese, or they couldn't work. It's the coolest thing ever! There is so much old school Japanese discipline in this kitchen. But, Shogo himself is such a friendly and positive guy. You can talk to him for hours. And the coolest thing about him is that he knows everything about Japanese history and pop culture! I've had the most fascinating conversations with him.\n\nI love coming to SUSHI ON RAINBOW and showing my respect to these great Japanese heroes. Also, every time I come here it's like that scene in \""""Goodfellas\"""" when Robert DeNiro walks into the club and everyone knows his name, they get him whatever he wants, and they even got a spot saved for him. I NEVER order here, all I say is \""""Omakase\"""" and they take care of everything for me. \n\nI've written 100s of Yelp reviews, but SUSHI ON RAINBOW is my absolute favorite restaurant in not just Las Vegas, but the whole world.",1
2073,"God help you when there's a wrestling tournament in town and you're checking out a grad program in CU.  No Union, no historic Lincoln....yes Super 8.\n\nNow, Super 8 is...a Super 8.

Because apparently what I ordered was a new one for her. Above all, they came back confirming my order thrice, thereafter, one time another server confirming.

2076,"I know how a poor Islamic Pilgrim feels when they pray at Mecca now. \n\nThis Majestic wonderland is split into two significant sections: a fairly casual bar area with numerous flat-screens and an amazing amount of taps. Your eyes will quickly find the flat screens with the up to date lists and serving varieties of the masterfully chosen beer (seriously, I've only seen one beer there that looked like it wasn't artfully chosen. It was a Cherry Blue Moon or some such thing.) There's so many amazing beers that it's actually hard to see them on the screen from the back of the bar.. And I have spectacular vision.\nThe other section is a Lovely combination of Hogwarts Dining Hall and a San Diego Beer Bar. Slightly brighter lighting, high tables and a beautiful view of the Keg Room. Tons of room for everyone here. This is the section I did not sit in and plan to on my next visit.\nThe food I had was glorious: Crunchy balanced Arrogant Bastard Fries with an expertly assembled burger. So Good.\nService was spectacular as well. The beer menu was said to be out of date but I have no idea how they could keep them up to date. Hence the flat screens.\nOne excellent idea: The beers are all six bucks: they are just served in different portions. The servers claim this is because of alcohol content (which is true: good beer is correlated to higher alcohol content) but we know what's up. Still six bucks per beer is really fantastic. It really cannot be overemphasized that this is the best selection of beer anywhere in Vegas. I honestly don't know where you're going to find a better diversity of ales and lagers. You're definitely going to need a jet to get there, wherever it might be. \nI hope that my fellow motorists, my family, and my insurance company appreciate how hard it is to stop drinking at this amazing temple of hops and barley.

Everything went very very well, our little guy was treated in the best possible way. (The doctor even let me go in the recovery room to comfort my dog.) It was serous surgery but our dog is doing GREAT now.\nWe do have to see Dr. Mc Comb  fairly often as our dog  has several issues that require frequent visits. Dr. McComb is an excellent diagnostician and a very skilled surgeon. We send many people there with confidence.  Everyone we have sent there has had nothing but very good things to say. If you get the right Vet..you save money because the malady is identified  and treated sooner and the animal suffers alot less.

It went perfectly with all of the meat we were eating. How we had room for dessert is beyond me but the hot molten cake and the tres leches, wow!

2081,I cannot comment on the food because we did not get any.  I was excited to go to Carlos Bakery (since I watch the show) but first let me start by saying it was nearly impossible and a pain to find.  Then when you do find the place it is jam packed with people that you cannot even see the displays to decide what (if anything) you want to order.  There were way too many people and it was chaos.

They were so moist and yummy...but then it just went down from there. I chose one of the three meals they offer for around $17 that comes with a cup of soup and a glass of wine--which I have to admit is a nice price. The soupwas good, but the salad I had him order so we could trade was SWIMMING in low-quality blue cheese dressing. My chicken and biscuits were disappointing as well. The biscuit was overdone, and the rest was an over salted gelatinous...thing.

The restaurant is located in the Plateau area of Montreal and even though it was a bit off the main strip, the place was busy the whole night.  \n\nMy only complaint that I would have to mention is that they charged you for parking in what looked like a auto repair shop that was closed for the night that was right across the street from the restaurant.  I figured that if you're spending what I thought was a decent amount of money for dinner, that even if they were being charged by the business, that they could spring for parking to make the experience 5 star worthy.  \n\nI'd still go back but might spend the extra minute or so to find a parking spot on the street.",1
2094,"This place is great! I wanted to check it out ever since I saw the place on Triple D. It is a small place and I recommend reservations. We were seated and looked over the menu's. I ordered the shrimp and grits.When it came out it looked so good! On the first bite, Awesome! The grits were buttery and smooth. The shrimp had the right amount of seasoning on them that it was easy to devour them and want more! My wife had the Blackend chicken sandwich and she really enjoyed that. The spices were really good. I really think this is one of the best places for shrimp and grits.\nLoved that the owner made her way over to us to check on our meal and chat with us a bit. Our service and and the great food will guarantee our return.",1
2095,"This place is awful, the portions are so small it's ridiculous paying almost $8 for rice, over-cooked vegetables and a tiny bit of bland chicken is a terrible rip off.

2096,"I was competely expecting something more exciting for my first Michelin star restaurant. As such, I was underwhelmed. Granted, I only got to experience the \""""special\"""" menu, which is a truncated version of what they have to offer. It definitely had highlights and lowlights. I enjoyed being able to see right into the kitchen from our seat at the bar.\n\nThe bread basket was pretty good, and the waiters were quite attentive to everyone.\n\nThe soup was some sort of cauliflower puree thing, which I did not like. The other soup, I can barely remember, but it was good enough.\n\nOn to the entree, the sweetbread was yummy but the John Dory was boring and overcooked. I actually really liked the veal sweetbread and savored every bite.\n\nThe creme brulee dessert was pretty good, so at least the dinner ended on a high note.\n\nIn all, I think I wouldn't come back, especially since the normal menu is so much more expensive and the \""""special\"""" menu wasn't too spectacular.",0

Not everyone knows how to cook them and corned beef hash which I ordered WELL done.  Of course the top was cooked well and middle not at all so I asked if they could put it back on the grill to cook it more..  As they walked away we heard one guy tell the other to put it in the microwave!   Lol\n\nWhen I got it back.... Well, do I really need to tell you?  The food was hot but not cooked and the based eggs were literally rubberized... The yolk was hard not runny as a basted egg should be. \n\nOne of the guys came back and I told him the eggs weren't basted he insisted the were..  I picked the eggs up by the white and it dangled there looking like they were Rubber!\n\nI ate the cooked top part of the hash and half piece of toast and my husband ate his bacon and part of the pancake, we asked for our check and told him how disappointed we were and all he did was apologize... I told him he should be offering to comp the un eaten meal..  He gave me a funny look and took back the check and said it would come out of his paycheck!  I said absolutely not and told him i would pay and he shouldn't take the loss because the cook doesn't know how to cook!\n\nI left a most generous tip and we Left... We noticed the help wanted sign for server and cook and I do hope they find people quick.... Especially someone who calls themselves a cook and actually knows what a freaking basted egg is!\n\nI feel sorry for all the snowbirds who flocked this diner that this is there only choice for food in town and even sorrier they somehow developed a taste for this crud on a plate!\n\nThe only reason I was generous and gave 2 stars is because I felt sorry for the hard working staff!\n\nSo there it is, plain and true!\n\nTry it if you want.... But don't say you weren't warned!\n\nEnjoy the weather and  Bon Appetite'",0

2101,"Belated review after a fantastic evening at Crudo, so I won't be as detailed as I should be, but I loved this place. Really enjoyed the fusion of sushi with Italian. \n\nThe pig ears are something you just have to get; crispy yet they melt in your mouth. My boyfriend and I each got three courses and then split a dessert, which seemed to be just the right amount of food. Not a bad price if you do it that way, as well. \n\nI loved the spacious atmosphere. Wish we were in town more to come back and try the rest of the menu.",1
2102,Promoters call it the best place go party in America. Boy are they wrong. Contacted a promoter to see Calvin Harris on Dec 28th. Mind you I am a girl and have 4 other girl friends with me. It seemed like we were all set on the guestlist and everything but when we got there they wanted a $40 cover. Um no. Girls in Vegas should never have to pay cover. A different and much better promoter ended up getting us free bottle service at surrender that same night and we had a blast. Then we decided to give it another shot and went to see tiesto a few days later. Holy shit it was packed like sardines. There is literally no room to move. It was awful. Skip this place and hit up marquee. So much better.,0
2103,"This place is a rip off!  The front desk told us the Suite was lowered to a Special Rate of $250, a bit more than the room we had booked in advance, but much bigger.  When I get the credit card bill, there is a charge for over $400 for the room.  \n\nI contacted the Hotel and they informed me that the $250 was an \""""upgrade\"""" fee on top of what we had paid for the original room.  When I explained to the Manager what the person at the front desk had told us, his response was...well that was verbal and it cannot be verified.  They were not willing to reduce the rate to $250.\n\nThe room was ok, but def not worth $400+, especially not with the horrible stinch of cigarettes in the room!\n\nWe would never stay in this Hotel again and don't recommend it to anyone.",0
2104,I will never come here again and I recommend that you don't either. Poor customer service noone is even here and we have been waiting for 30 minutes.

I have had better service at the DMV in south phoenix!,0
2105,"If you want the best Marbella experience, visit their beautifully designed website, and then stop there. Marbella crafts perfectly mediocre, unimaginative tapas. I have been here thrice and do not foresee a fourth visit - although, the stuffed mushrooms were enjoyable enough. The paella was particularly bad (dry and tasteless). The service and decor are both passable. To be safe, just pass on this place all together.",0
2106,"I really have tried to give this restaurant a shot.  I've been 4 or 5 times now, and other than the friendly staff, I just don't have anything positive to share about it.  \n\nThe food is always glistening with oil/grease!  Everything from the rice to the corn tortillas is shiny. \n\nToday, I just wanted some fish taco's a-la Rubios or Baja Fresh and instead spent $13 for uber greasy (hey- a little grease now and then is just fine, but this is beyond gross) tacos.  They tasted okay, but I couldn't help but wonder if Crisco is their main friend???  Ewwwww.  \n\nSorry, I don't have a better review, but I gave them 4 or 5 tries to make something that wasn't dripping in gooey lard!  \n\nBetter luck to you.  \n\nWarmly,\n\nKirin:)",0
2107,"Nobou presents itself as Japanese tapas. The flavors were quite amazing - the portions, even for tapas, were quite small however. We ordered 6 plates and 2 beers and walked out with a $120 bill. It was quite a treat but the price was somewhat of a turn off.",1
2108,"We stayed at MGM Grand for 3nights and one friend invited us for dinner in Nobhill Tavern which is also located in the hotel. It is a fine dine in restaurant and has an intimate set up. The food are really great and served in perfect portion, not huge and not even small. I love the sampler the manager gave us. Everything is just so good. But but but... the prices were not cheap at all. Better prepare at least $100 if you will bring a date here. Haha. We went here twice.",1
2109,"I have been to this place about 15 times and each time I have gotten the roasted turkey and stuffing (their specialty) and it is so good I have not tried any other sandwich that they make. I'm sure their other sandwiches are good, but when I go in there to eat and I see people ordering and eating other sandwiches and it actually kind of infuriates me to the point where I have to take deep breaths and refrain myself from getting in right in their face and screaming, \""""What the %$#& is your problem? Why aren't you eating the roasted turkey and stuffing sandwich?\"""" I was there today and some chick ordered a quesadilla.....???? Again I am sure the quesadilla is good, but seriously you need an MRI AND a taste buds transplant if you order a F$%#ing quesadilla at an amazing sandwich joint like this. \n\nThe cold turkey compliments the warm stuffing perfectly with just the right amount of mayo on the sandwich. The sausage stuffing is out of this world good. I wish they sold their stuffing in huge containers to take home so I could dump it in my bathtub and bathe in it nightly.",1
2110,"The Yelp review I was going to write when I left the store lost a full star by the time I got home, for one simple reason:\n\nDickey's can not get an order right to save their effing lives.\n\nEvery time I've had takeout from there, something has always been missing. Sometimes it's something small, like the onion and pickle that are supposed to come with every platter but only show up about half the time. Sometimes it's something medium and annoying like a missing side. Sometimes it's something mission-critical, like the bacon on a baked potato. They did, however, make sure to include BBQ sauce! With my baked potato, so the bag had a smoked meat aroma that taunted me in the absence of the missing bacon. #fail\n\nIt's a shame too, because the food here is actually decent. At $4, those giant stuffed baked potatoes are a great deal. Their BBQ isn't the best I've ever had, but it's certainly good for a quick-service counter joint, and I'd sooner eat here than the flavorless Famous Dave's and the stupefyingly overrated Memphis Championship BBQ. And they get bonus points for serving smoked turkey year-round.\n\nOther good meats include the pulled pork and the hot link. The best sides here are the waffle fries, cole slaw, potato salad and baked potato casserole. The sweet tea is as it should be, and they offer complimentary pickles and soft-serve ice cream, which is a nice value-added touch.\n\nThe BBQ sauce is perfectly acceptable but nothing special. They have sweet and hot variants for a little spice of life. I prefer the hot, although I don't think it even has the slightest bit of heat to it.\n\nBottom line on this place? Decent BBQ, especially for the price, but be sure to audit your order, because the only thing you can depend on with their service is its complete lack of dependability.",0
2111,"I've been playing hockey at Castle for years, and the only reason I go here is because its the only half way decent place to play inline hockey within an hour of me. The arena is in the crappiest part of Phoenix and the building itself is some corny Castle, it looks like a kids' play pen. The building gets way too hot in the summer, the rink is not cleaned enough, and the officiating is horrible. The league fees are also too expensive, if it goes up one more dollar I wouldn't play there anymore. The locker rooms are way too small to fit a team of 8 guys. The leagues are not very popular, with only 4 teams per league. Too many travel players play on the lower leagues, when they stick to the top league. Whenever it rains, the games are canceled because the roof is a sieve. The only reason this place got 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love hockey and I'm always in a good mood when I go to play. \n\nFor those of you who don't play hockey, Castle also has a crappy soccer field with boards, or you can play inside on the roller rink...ha! There's a gym upstairs but I never see people going there.",0

2116,"Went with a couple of girlfriends on Sunday night.  The music, fantastic however the service was not so!  One must mortgage their house to pay for the overpriced drinks that are in glasses so small they could pass as shot glasses.  Our server, rude is putting it mildly..  Samantha (Sam) was slow and rarely checked back with us as she spent most of her time chatting with her coworkers at the end of the bar.  I asked for Disaronno and she laughed with a sarcastic attitude and said she never heard of it.  She never offered to find out if they have it and asked what else could she get instead.  Every time we asked her a question she couldn't hear us because she was wearing earplugs.  Hmmm,  you're working at a place that offers live music, DUH. I'll be back for the music but will not be served by Sam.",0
2117,"If I could give Alaska Airline 0 stars I would. With all of the Airlines that i have flown with, my worst experience would be with this Airline.  First, our flight was canceled in Seattle so we decided to call reservation while waiting to  talk to a customer service agent in person.  I was a little hesitant with the customer service agent because I saw the way she was servicing the person before us. Of course no smile, no nothing, she dreaded our existence as if she did not want to be working. I asked her about our flight and she had no clue it was canceled due to maintenance, she basically told us she couldn't help us so i ask for a supervisor. The supervisor at the station had the worst attitude in customer service that I have ever encountered, believe me when i said that i stayed calm the whole time.  The supervisor did not know the reasoning for the canceled flight either until she paged someone. Her rude attitude was no acceptable. We had an event the moment we land and had to be in the Las Vegas Convention center right after so our urgency to get on the next flight was not a concern to them. I asked if it was possible to get on the next available flight or another airline, they did not want to help, they did not give us any options, no nothing. Noted the cancellation was due to maintenance and not weather related but they felt like they don't have to take ownership for it.  As to many other airlines they understand that maintenance is under their control and would find ways to help their customers.  The reasoning for not helping us was of course we are not a \""""diamond member, as she stated something close to that.  We asked if it's possible to put us on stand by for the next flight, she finally did, and after we took a few steps away form the counter we heard the supervisor gossiping about the situation, yes very professional.   Feeling uneasy about the experience, the night before leaving Vegas we got down to the conference room in our hotel building  and realized they had screwed up our flight coming back from Vegas to Seattle. Of course, with the service and screw up they have given us in Seattle, we were not surprise at all. When we called reservations they tried to place the blame on something else! What a sh!t show. Alaska Airline can not take ownership of their own companies fault, they pass it around to anything that they could to make their company hold that image of being the better airline.  The no good agent and supervisors in the Seattle Airport was a joke, Please fire them. Terrible work ethic and customer service.  They represent your company and if this is the face of Alaska Airline why should we choose your mileage card compared to other Airlines? Especially with Alaska Airline's terrible service? We shared this information inside the Las Vegas Convection Center with several people and will be sharing this terrible service to many more, for even though we are not your \""""Diamond members\"""" we are still your customers. We made the mistake of choosing your mileage program this past year. and now we know better. We know we fly frequently enough to know better that service should not be this terrible.  It was a big surprise for us due to the fact that Alaska Airline should be one of the best and from this experience, it was the worst out of the 8 flights i have taken this year.",0
2118,This place absolutely SUCKS!  It's super expensive for crappy food. The bartender doesn't know how to make a whiskey sour. The server I had was named buddy and he was crap too. Such an expensive place and they still hand you a to go box instead of doing it themselves. Real classy. What a horrible redone place. Beef eatery atleast was good.,0
2119,"So good! So adorable! I want to give it 5 stars and there is only one reason I'm not going to. The service.\n\nThe service was strangely slow. It kept seeming like our server was forgetting about us. Even when he'd come over he seemed pretty distracted. The woman who was refilling the waters also seemed pretty distracted. At one point she dumped so much ice in my husbands cup that it was a little ice mountain sticking out of it. And then she overfilled my cup with water which started spilling on me but she never noticed. They also never even asked if we wanted a second glass of wine or beer. I probably would have gone for it seeing as we had to wait for the food for so so long.\n\nThe food though, the food was so worth the wait!!! First of all the appetizer we had, mozzarella and basil was amazing. The basil was really fresh. There seemed to be two types of mozzarella, and the really creamy one on top of the appetizer was to die for. The pesto drizzled across the plate I could drink.\n\nThey have a really nice option where you can choose 2 out of 3 things, half sandwich, cup of soup and half salad. All for $9.75. I went for the half vegetarian sandwich and half Italian picnic salad. I loved both. The vegetarian sandwich was unlike any vegetarian sandwich I'd had before. Sure I've had the things on it before, but I'm thinking not together, and maybe not stuff of such high quality. The salad had these delicious cheeses in it along with bacon. What's not to love?\n\nWe sat outside on the patio and it was so nice. Really pretty furniture and accents and I loved the outdoor/indoor bar.\n\nSo, weird service, if the food had sucked I would have been annoyed, but since it didn't I'll just hope that's not normal because I'm going back for sure.",1

I do know that i like Belgium Strong Ales. So started with a few samples (They are happy to let you sample any thing that is on draft) Decided on one of the 10%+ abv. dark ales- still only $3. Hell yes. Had a few of those throughout the evening and the table shared the hangover pizza for noms. Pizza was pretty tasty. Can anything with 3 types of bacon on it not be?  My only teeny tiny gripe is with the egg and its the same as when i had the steak and egg philly on my last visit. I dig eggs on burgers with runny yolks.  Instead, here the egg is scrambled and mixed in with everything. Not really what i was expecting. \nOverall, cool place. Service is good, food is decent and the beers are awesome. I highly recommend checking it out on a $3 draft night.",1

2122,"I moved into this building (luckily into a rental) in November. It looks very cute and nice on the outside and my apartment has been updated with vinyl floors that look like hardwood. It also has very cute custom paint on the walls. As it looks very appealing as to the reason I moved in, there has been nothing but issues since I moved in. The walls are thin, so if your neighbors play music, you can definitely hear it easily. Also, the tenant above me has hardwood floors so I can hear them walking back and forth. So far since I've moved in, I believe they have shut the water off at least 10 times to do maintenance. The day I moved in, there was a flood in the club house. There has been a pipe burst outside that flooded the parking lot. Today there was a flood and they had to turn off the water to the whole complex. When I called the emergency after hours line, they said it happened at 2am. It is now almost 7am and they haven't notified anyone by any means of communication that nobody in the building will be able to shower this morning. I've also had a problem with bugs, I have found a few baby cockroaches and centipedes in the unit. I'm a very clean person so the bug problem is a huge surprise to me. I have notified my property manager with the multiple issues as well as the building and it seems its always someone else's problem. In other words (mine, the tenant). Which is B.S. if you ask me. I gave it a two star rating because it does look nice and there is very good security 24 hours a day.

2124,"Came here to get new tires, because my tread was getting pretty low on the front two. Ended up selling me all four, and I can't honestly tell you if it was absolutely necessary or not.. But its ok, because now they are all new. About a week later I left town and parked my car at the airport to come back to my rear tire completely flat. Upset because I had just gotten new ones, but they said it was under warranty so I took it back in.  First staff member wasn't the friendliest, and  I waited an hour and a half for them to patch a hole or find what was wrong.  They came out to say they couldn't find anything wrong with it( after putting it in water to see bubbles and everything. etc..) I was pretty upset, but figured, well If it gets flat again I will just bring it back. Literally, 4 days later the exact same tire.. flat. Thankfully I have an air pressure pump at my condo because there is no way I could of even drove to a gas station. I filled it, and as I was putting the cap on the gauge, I see a very thick, and metal something sticking out in the tread. Exactly what had caused the initial flat.  VERY upset, that they ' couldn't find it' I took it back, circled it in the brightest red lipstick I own and barged in. Store manager was there that day and was very nice and apologetic, and they patched the tire successfully. However, I don't think I will go back next time as it makes me a bit weary to know that tire tecs can't find a piece of metal sticking out of the tire. Also felt a bit like they tried to take me the first round since I was a female and was upfront about knowing nothing about car specs.",0

2136,"I think this place was pretty good.  I'm an east coaster.  I usually cook my own shellfish when I get a craving for it but this time I felt like getting some in public.  The patio is smoking which for us smokers is a rare treat.  They had poker going on that night.  They basically took up the entire patio but they seemed like wonderful people (I love to play free Texas Hold Em but the wife was with me) they were polite and having fun.\n\nThe service was EXCELLENT.  Two bartenders on that night.  They seemed incredibly busy with the poker people but they always came and checked on us.  Never once did we feel ignored.  To be honest, it was the best service I've had in quite some time.  Extra bonus points seeing they running around for the poker people.\n\nThe food was outstanding.  I had crab cakes and they were AMAZING.  My wife had the talipa and it was tasty.  \n\nOverall, this is my kind of place and I would come here again.  If time allows it, I'd love to come back to play poker.",1

2138,"I came sorta unknowingly because me and bf were meeting up with his fam.  We were seated near the bar and there were tons of TVs everywhere and lots of enthusiastic sports fans.  \n\nThe beer list is super extensive and the food seemed pretty expensive... but hey it's Vegas.  I wanted the Epic without Fermentation beer under their seasonals but I guess they were out so the server recommended the St. Bernardus.  It was really strong for me, but it's ok I ordered it.  I wasn't too hungry and ordered the junk chips based on yelpers suggestions and the other party ordered fried pickles.  From looking at the only pic on yelp of the junk chips, my chips didn't really look like that.  The chips on the yelp pic looks even spread, but when my junk chips came out the BBQ ragu was only like at the bottom chips and the bleu cheese was uneven and then like a lump of  scallions on the very top chip.  As far as the flavors, the housemade chips were like thicker lays BBQ chips and I felt they were pretty salty and sweet which didn't compliment the overpowering flavors of the BBQ ragu and the bleu cheese.  I don't know.  Just not my favorite.\n\nThe fried pickles were good.  They were just thin/thick enough with a nice coating.  It came with 3 dipping sauces which were a housemade ketchup, sirracha ranch that was pretty spicy, and a bleu cheese dip.  \n\nOverall I wouldn't make it a point to come here for lunch/dinner but maybe a quick (expensive) snack because it was a nice place to relax.",0
2139,"I'm quite forgiving and usually will give a place a second chance, I truly regret that I gave this atrocious place another.\n\nThe food itself is fine.  the coconut shrimp and the ribs are always well done.  Their crab dip is also quite delightful, and you can easily be filled up on this stuff alone.\n\nHowever when it comes to the MGM location, the star meter should be in the negatives strictly based on service alone.  Never have I been to a place where I've felt more neglected and treated so rudely.  This is the second time it's happened to me here and I'll never come to this location again.\n\nOur story starts off with us getting seated next to a huge b-day party of fifteen.  Our hostess leaves telling us to enjoy our \""""safari\"""".  Ten minutes go by and not a single \""""hello\"""" or drink order from anyone.  I'm tipping over w/ rage at this point based upon my previous experience and immediately call upon my first manager.  I explained to her how time has gone by and we haven't been helped and she was shocked and took our order right away.\n\nNow you'd think at this point the person that's supposed to be waiting on us would've come by to apologize at least.  If he did that all would be forgiven somewhat.  However he didn't.  In stead he acted like his mom just took away his TV privileges for a month and he slid our waters onto our table, tossed my dining card on the table and stormed off.  I had it at this point and was redder than their stupid sparkly thing they put on their volcano dessert.\n\nUpon comes my request for manager #2.  I requested that our waiter be removed and replaced with a different one or we get reseated to a different section.  I even could've played the race card if I wanted to as it was clear our waiter didn't like Asians and would rather serve his own kind, but I let it be.  The manager was very apologetic and introduced us to our new waitress as the other manager came over with our appetizers.  At this point our original waiter came over and noticed both his bosses and another colleague were at our table and actually tried to come over and take the appetizer platter away from the manager and serve it to us.  Everyone kind of just looked at him stunned.  Needless to say I wasn't too pleased and voiced my opinion to have him removed from our presence immediately.  The managers shooed him away like you would any animal that came near your property.  \n\nThe service did get better at this point as Manager #2 was always within our line of sight and he kept a constant watch to make sure we were taken care of.  However this didn't make up for the delays and the neglect right off the start.\n\nI admire the managers for taking control and making sure they did what they could to rectify a poor situation, however the bad service from our original waiter stems from above.  They should have a firmer grip on their staff and should make sure they hire people that know how to do a good job.\n\nFood is a 3-star, however the experience ruins all aspects of it altogether.",0
2140,"I was a fan of Glass Nickel until this last experience. I ordered the Chicken Cordon Bleu and upon eating the last piece my teeth crunched into something hard. I thought it was a chicken bone, which is understandable, but it was instead a piece of metal. Glad I didn't swallow that bite whole! \n\nI called the store that delivered the pizza and the staff apologized for the incident, even offering a credit for next time, which was good, but I wasn't confident in her follow-up for investigating how this happened, so I want to be sure it's not just covered up. Thanks Yelp!\n\nAlbeit I was probably unlucky with this, it still ruins this pizza chain for me. \n\nAdvise to management: focus on improving practices in your ktichen so don't serve your customers metal-filled pizzas in the future!",0

I know that many places in the valley claim to serve healthy food, but serving \""""all-natural\"""" and locally farmed foods doesn't necessarily mean it's healthy.  People that are true foodie's know exactly what I mean.\n\nI ordered the Dragon Bowl with quinoa and it was delicious.  I'm excited to try this place again.",1
2142,"Not a fan of my sandwich being tossed into the microwave twice. I think they heated up the turkey in the microwave and then they decided to melt the cheese in the micro as well. This was the turkey rueben and it was a pretty lame move on these guys part, especially when I see a flattop grill right below the microwave. Bread would have been crispier and the sandwich as a whole would have been great, but even these two local women decide to take shortcuts and the results are a soggy sandwich made by lazy cooks/owners. They still use quality turkey, but the rest is a joke.",0

It seemed like we were a bother. \n\nThe beet salad was yummy and hubby's filet had good flavor but lacked in the presentation. I liked the flavor more than he did. It looked blah. \nWe asked which side was a good one and went with the hash browns. What a waste! They were straight out of a freezer with a little topping.

It's so freaking amazing and the bread it comes on is local and delicious.  The owner is very friendly and we have always made sure to go back and try other things.  They also have a really good caribbean beef sandwich too.  $7.50 for a sandwich tots and a pc of candy to end.  Its def worth it.,1

I figured he got my order wrong.  Nope, I was wrong... THERE WAS A $8 DELIVERY FEE!!!!!  What!  I called the place back and told them no one told me this and the flier left on my door step made no mention of this.  The manager told me he meant to call me back to tell me and I should just pay for it.  I told him he was crazy.  I gave the delivery guy a $5 tip and told him I'll never be calling back.\n\nThe pizza was horrible.  Tasteless!  The wings were disgusting.  \n\nI'll never order again.  I think my point is clear.

2152,"I've been living in the valley for 3 years now and I love everything about this place, except the Chinese food!  I have been nothing but disappointed up to this point.  Everyone claims to have NYC Chinese and none of it is even close.  I just happen to be in chandler and happen to stop by this place.  It was a toss up between the safe bet (the bbq spot next door) and this joint.  After carful thought I decided to give this place a try.  \n\nEverything about the inside reminded me of home but I need to try the food to be sure.  I ordered the basics; shrimp fried rice, orange chicken, and beef and broccoli.  To my surprise, the food resembled NYC Chinese food!  The orange chicken looked normal, not like sweet and sour chicken balls.  The sauce had orange peals and red chili peppers.  Could this be?  Is this the real deal? I've learned to inspect and taste the food before I leave.  I'm happy to say that after one small bite I was blown away.  I took one bite and was back in Brooklyn at the So Good Chinese Carry out.  This is hands down the best Chinese food in town, so good that I drive 40 miles to chandler once a week to get a taste of NYC.  \n\nIf your from the east coast and love NY style Chinese food, this is the place to get it.  NO WHERE  in the Valley can come close to this place, I want them to open more locations around the valley!",1
2153,"I went to Bar Cocoa last night with my family ( there were 5 of us including my 10yr old daughter). We were excited because we are a sweet crazed family! I was looking forward to some gelato even though it was a bit cold outside but sadly, out of the 5 flavors offered, none were to my liking. My favorite flavors are anything with chocolate or caramel but neither were offered. \n\nMy family immediately gravitated toward the cake display so I joined them. Two people purchased chocolate cupcakes, one a red velvet cupcake, another the pumpkin cheesecake and I got the coconut cake. The service at Bar Cocoa was great! The gentleman was friendly, smiling and very pleasant. At the bar they only offered coffee and hot chocolate. We were encouraged to grab a seat at the Ritz Carlton lounge area where we would be offered a wider selection of drinks.\n\nOur desserts were all just average tasting. No one, including myself, was wowed by anything. I usually love most coconut flavored anything but this cake was filled with big chunks of coconut flakes. I couldn't detect any actual cake in there at all. It was unpleasantly chewy. I don't recommend it.\n\nThe lounge in the Ritz was dimly lit with a beautiful stone fireplace toward the back where there is a second bar serving cocktails. The lounge area was fairly empty. There was one table occupied with a couple. My family and I sat down and were noticed by the female server as we walked in but she didn't approach our table. I found that odd but I waited. About 5 minutes later she went to the table with the couple and asked them if they wanted more drinks. She took their order, left, and promptly returned with their drinks. Then she left again without coming over to us. Another 5 minutes goes by and a second couple enters the lounge area with their desserts from Bar Cocoa. As as they're seated she approaches their table and asks if they want anything. Then she leaves again without even looking our way. At that point we were almost done and didn't want to stay any longer with such rude and dismissive service. \n\nI am not sure why she chose to ignore our table but I was extremely disappointed. I expected better from such an establishment. With mediocre desserts and horrible service I definitely won't be going back or bringing anymore guests with me when looking for a place to satisfy our sweet tooth. I give the two stars for the gentleman that served us our desserts.",0
2154,"I know Fuel is predominately a pizza joint, but as much as I love their pizza, the one thing they do best is buffalo chicken wings. There are a few staples that one needs in life and for me a need for crispy, hot buffalo wings, drenched in cool ranch dressing, is a craving that hits me often. I will search high and low to find the perfect wings and thankfully, they can be delivered to my doorstep by Fuel (no matter what time it is). \n\nTheir wings have the best balance of spicy sauce to crispy skin. They offer a variety of sauces, but my favorite is the classic hot. Some people may complain that it is too spicy for their taste, but I think it packs just enough heat to break a sweat, but not too much to leave me hurting. I love to order my wings extra crispy, because there is nothing better then the crunchy bite of the skin before getting to the soft meat of the wing.  \n\nI can be a pain in the butt and ask for my wings to get a little extra attention (more specifically, some fresh chopped garlic and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese) sometimes, but Fuel always puts up with my requests. They even know people can be picky about their carrots vs. celery and will let you customize your order to be \""""all celery\"""" or vice versa. \n\nI prefer to eat in when ordering wings, because they fry the wings upon ordering and I am ready and waiting to get my hands on them, but on a lazy Sunday (or late Saturday night) I will request a delivery of my order. My only complaint is that the Styrofoam boxes that the wings are packaged in tend to create perspiration and reduce the crispiness of the wings. If they could poke holes in the top of the box to let the wings breathe, life would be just perfect. \n\nI dare you to find a better wing in Charlotte.",1

It took us almost an hour to get up there, and then we were seated by a table as far away from the revolving window as possible. We were disappointed with being seated so far away from the window but besides that disappointed in the cleanliness of the place. It had a funky smell, moldy and possibly smokey? The carpet looked dirty and so did the bench that we were seated on. 5 star restaurant, so dirty? Well, I guess it is old so okay.. we stayed and waited (for a very long time for our waiter), we talked about asking to be seated closer to the window. How cool would it be to enjoy the view as the restaurant revolved! It was a week night and there were plenty of tables available right next to the windows, we figured it should be no problem. The waitress told us \""""no,\"""" and looked at us like we were problem customers. The restaurant is very expensive here and atmosphere is important to us. We asked if she could ask a manager because we were considering going elsewhere if we couldn't enjoy the view.

2165,I went to this location as they were in my network providers and conveniently located in a shopping center I frequent - their cross streets are Eastern & St. Rose.  Upon entering I was greeted by one of their sales associates and I found throughout my hour in the store every customer would be greeted warmly and asked how they can be assisted.  I was directed to the reception desk for the doctor and promptly checked in and given forms.  Within 10 minutes I was brought in for my annual eye exam.  Each step of the exam went smoothly and I never waited longer than 10 minutes for either the doctor or tech - the hour went by fast. \n\nHaving insurance I was clearly explained how I could use my benefits and given their opinion how I should use it based on my needs i.e. use my credit towards contacts vs a new pair of eye glasses.  I was never explained this before so other stores would just get my money out of pocket and I would never know about my benefits and how to maximize it!  Really nice to be able to trust their services at this store.  Will be coming back for my new frames in a couple months.  \n\nMy appointment was on a Monday morning - not sure if this is a peak time but when I was there business picked up to about 10-15 customers in the store and everyone was being taken care of in a timely manner! I also saw a little girl about 6-7 years old getting an exam and was crying and seemed scared - everyone was patient with her and coaching her through it.  Parents seemed at ease and the staff is very friendly! Highly recommended!,1

The food was really not tasty, I had onion bhaji's to start which were dry and tasteless, and my friends had a selection of kebabs which they said were chewy, and they really looked unappealing. The curries were equally awful. I had the chicken bhuna, which had a super watery sauce, and the chicken was really chewy and stringy, and there was a layer of oil on the whole thing making it taste rank to be honest. The rice was also over cooked and was pretty soggy. To their credit though, the nan bread was tasty was was the best part of the meal - but it would be pretty difficult to mess that up! \n\nThe meal was really expensive too, with two courses coming to about \u00a317 - really not worth it.

2171,I saw Zumanity a little over a year ago when I was in Vegas for my 21st birthday. This was the first Cirque show that I have ever seen and I was blown away. This show was sexy and fun. The actors are also extremely talented. The acrobats were my favorite. If you're in Vegas and want to see a talent filled show then definitely go see Zumanity. And be sure to get there about 30 minutes early. The interaction with the audience before the show is hilariously terrific!,1

2174,"I booked my daughters first birthday here.  We were promised in the $164 we paid a month prior, 10 free tickets for day of, a entertainer for 1 hour, party favors for the kids, and a free year membership for the birthday girl.  We were supposed to be there at 3:00 for the party to be at 330.  The party before us ran over, pushing our set up time to past the party start time.  Our guests had to wait out in the mall for almost a hour.  They gave us extra time at the end, which we didn't even use. We didn't have an entertainer, the guy that was supposed to be doing it was only there for a max of 10 min. No party favors, glad I made my own. No membership at all.  Then they wanted to charge me $170+ for the 10 people who were already part of the $164 plus the additional people who came to the party but didn't actually go through the aquarium or paid already. I for sure won't be going back for another party or to visit the aquarium, which is a shame cause my daughter loves watching the fish.",0

2179,"Con's - parking,  length of wait, quality of food, variety of food, overcrowding/poor organization of buffet. \n\nPro's - beautiful decor.  \n\nFinal analysis: Not worth it, even at the low pricel.  Even the breakfast buffet at Circus Circus could out do this one.\n\nFrom start to finish, this was a horrible breakfast experience.  First, the parking says 'free with validation ' but it's pay first, then get reimbursed from the cashiers cage.  Not the accepted definition of validation!   Also, the parking attendant was a complete jerk, when asked about it. \n\nOnce inside, we waited almost thirty minutes in line to pay.  One Cashier for a line that stretched to over fifty people?  Really? Right as we were checking out, we heard someone on the walkie talkies say she was coming to the front to assist with checkout.  Insult to injury at that point.\n\nThe selection and quality of food was absolutely terrible.  Scrambled eggs that were runny.  The line for individual omelettes was so long as to make it not worth the wait.  If you expected fresh fruit, you'd be disappointed, it was all canned.  While I know they don't make their own pudding, you don't want it (or the yogurt) looking like it had just been dumped out of a can into a bowl.  Also, three separate giant bowls of prunes seemed like overkill.  \n\nThe bacon and sausage were very good, but by the time I wanted seconds, the lines for food were ten people deep.  Bread products were obviously frozen and/or made elsewhere.  Bread still in its plastic bags was left out for toast.  They didn't even have real butter, just 'spread'.",0

I thought, ok I'll just ask this nice looking person to slide down a seat so I could sit with my husband.  Apparently this is a huge no-no.  The hostess intervened and said that they can't ask anyone to move.  Whatever, we left.  So I came back today with a large group.  Tons of open tables but none together.  You would think since they don't take reservations they would seat their customers appropriately to prepare for a group of five or more (not too uncommon right?). They should really take reservations and seat their customers in a systematic way.",0

Then we asked if it came with fries, she said separate - she wasn't kidding a small plate for 10.99 -- yikes! \nPastrami was a pound of meat between two slices of bread, cheeseburger - very bland, and the fries look the same as Jack In The Boxe's curly fries. \nNot impressed -- what was the kicker is the $45 bill for those three items.\n\nI would not recommend this for a quick snack, I could have taken a cab and ate for that price.",0
2188,"Just horrible. Lived here for 4 years without a problem. New management took over. Last year the office's night drop box for rent checks was broken into and all the rent checks in there that night were stolen, forged and cashed. After providing proof from Western Union that we had bought our rent check and it had been one of the checks that had been stolen, we were told not to worry about the situation anymore. Then every month, after we paid rent, we would get harassed for the \""""missing\"""" rent money. Again we would provide the paperwork needed to prove our check had been stolen out of THEIR night drop box. But every month they seemed to forget they told us not to worry and continued to harass us more and more. Can I also say they didn't have a security guard or cameras or anything to protect thousands of dollars of their residents and clients money and it's our problem it got stolen??!!! They even said they knew who did it so WTF???\nAfter months of stress I finally wrote a letter to corporate explaining the situation and how rude the office staff was and how much of a moron the manager had been every time I talked to her.\nInstead of caring about what their customers were going through, corporate not only wrote me a rude email back, THEY EVICTED US BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T PAY THE STOLEN RENT MONEY THAT THEY GOT STOLEN IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!! This was like six months after the fact. Six months of my life dealing with their harassment then getting kicked out after we'd been there for 4 years and ALWAYS paid rent on time!!!! And I had provided every piece of proof and paperwork they had asked us for. Ridiculous. The only positive is that we finally got out of the sh@!hole that is Las Vegas.\nDon't waste your hard earned money here!!!",0
2189,"We have been to Leroy Fox several times and our most recent visit was a couple nights ago.  We were seated quickly upon arrival and the server took our drink order right away. It was fairly crowded for a Tuesday night.  The place has a comfortable feel. There are booths, tables, and you can sit at the bar. Behind the bar are many TVs.  My wife and mother-in-law ordered the fried chicken.  I had the chicken fried steak and my son had the BBQ sandwich and my daughter had the mac and cheese. A couple, pieces of the fried chicken were not cooked thoroughly so we sent it back. Two entire meals were returned to us and they comped our desserts.  They handled the situation perfectly. Things can happen once in a while anywhere but the way it is handled is what counts the most and Leroy Fox knows customer service better than most. The food was very good. My daughter loves the mac and cheeses and my chicken steak was delicious.  The asparagus and fries are also good. The desserts were tasty too.  The food, service and ambiance are all reasons to return to the Fox.  It is a good value too.",1

They work 24/7, they came to my house and took full size rats out of my attic at 6 am (so I could still make it to work on time), and now they come regularly to spray around my house and yard for bugs.

I bought a sampling of all they had to offer and thought maybe my daughter would appreciate the cupcakes.  My husband ate them on the way home from the market!

2194,"Had a horrible experience here. And it was my first time at Dillard's.\n\nI had purchased something at the Origins counter. The two ladies who helped me were pushy and catty. They made several comments about products I might be interested to get my skin to look better since it looks like I use a lot of foundation. When I told them that I do not wear foundation, rather than apologizing they stared at my face closer and says \""""it looks like you do\"""". Chose to take this as a compliment meaning I had nice skin. I was willing to overlook it because the product (the face serum) was so good, but all in all they could work on their people skills a little more.\n\nGot back the hotel, opened the box to use it- inside the package was a bottle of the serum with all the paint chipped off, and the bottle was empty. This thing was used to the max.\n\nTwo days later I bring it back with the receipt, original packaging, everything. I wind up talking to a manager who I instantly know is going to give me a hard time. She asks me to wait 15 minutes until one of the Origins associates who helped me gets back from lunch.\n\n35 minutes later (I have a show to catch!) I'm waiting at the Origin's counter. A goddess mystery woman from another counter comes over and says she'll do the exchange for me so I don't have to wait.\n\nThe manager does not let her, and then lets me know they can't accept something in this repugnant condition back. She was pretty obvious about what she was insinuating: that I replaced the product I received with an old bottle of mine to try to get a new, free bottle.\n\nI mean, I would've understood if it was just policy holding her back from giving me a new bottle but it was her entire demeanor that was insulting. If she hadn't done everything but accuse me of replacing it, if she had seemed sincere about trying to help me and sorry that I received a piece of absolute crap then I might've been okay with Dillard's.\n\nNo. In the end, the manager spoke to her supervisor who told me to give me an exchange or let me return it for credit back on my card. I returned it because my experience was so unpleasant that I didn't want to give them the business. I'd rather go out of my way to buy the product elsewhere.\n\nAll I can say is that the polite, mystery cosmetics lady and the mean manager's supervisor were the only helpful people I encountered. And my horrible experience at Dillard's influenced my opinion of Origins.\n\nI know that not everyone has this same experience, but as for me I will not be returning to Dillard's.",0
2195,"I've been to the Grand Canyon before but this was my first time seeing The West side of the Canyon.  I enjoyed this trip but skipped one of the stops.  First off, $$ shouldn't really be the judge of this situation.  If you don't like spending $$, don't spend money and shut up about it.  If it's going to make you bitter to spend a little more money to go on the sky walk, then go to the other parts of the canyon and save a few bucks.  \n\nThe skywalk isn't a must but it definitely was interesting.  You get to stand over the canyon but you are very close to the edge. Upon entering there is a sign that warns that the skywalk is earthquake resistant only up to 8.0 (which was very scary).  The skywalk itself felt very sturdy and you get a photographer who will take as many pictures as you want so that later you can choose some and buy then if you choose to do so.  They are pricey $30/print, but we just bought one and it worked out since we didn't have anyone to take unlimited pix of us otherwise (only two of us).\n\nI preferred Guano Point to the Skywalk.  The Skywalk was fun but I felt more impressed at the top of the little mountain on Guano Point.  You don't have to pay extra for that and you get this tremendous 360 view of the canyon, you can take AMAZING photos from here but be prepared to climb a little for the best view.  Also, at Guano Point you can eat lunch on top of the world!\n\nFor anyone coming from Vegas, the drive is pretty long but it's beautiful!  Once you get off the freeway the roadside gets prettier and prettier as you near the canyon because you enter a Joshua Tree forest.  Beware of cows and jackrabbits. We almost hit a cow on our way in (they're right by the road).  Also, be warned that there is a long dirt road on the way to the canyon.  I enjoyed the dirt road but it was at least 30mins work of rugged landscape (very pretty, we played cowboy songs).  There is also a ranch leading up to the canyon and you can stop there for beer and food.  \n\nAll in all the trip was long but I enjoyed it.  It was a different view of the canyon than I had ever seen before.  Not being able to take my camera on the skywalk was super annoying, something done to make money off of turning part of the res into a tourist attraction.  It makes sense so I didn't much mind.\n\nThe buses that take you to the different locations were very nice charter buses, so don't worry about getting an old beat up twinkie bus because that didn't happen.\n\nHonestly I would've done this trip just for the drive out, I hadn't seen a Joshua Tree forest in a very long time (haven't been on a road trip in a while) and the dirt road was a hoot!  \n\nDON'T SKIP GUANO POINT, ITS THE BEST VIEW!\n\nAlso: keep your children close because they do not rope off the edges of the canyon, anyone can just fly off if they feel like it so watch them!\n\nI'm giving this a 4star just because it cost so much money to do the things we did.  It was worth it but so are the other parts of the canyon that cost less to see and provide more of a view. This was a unique experience and I loved it!",1
2196,4 stars for the atmosphere. There are not many places in Pittsburgh to dine along the water and the outdoor seating at Redfin Blues is fantastic-huge outdoor deck with lots of tables under umbrellas. It was the perfect venture for Sunday Funday and I don't know why I have never been here before-well it is pretty hidden. They have a large parking lot and the outdoor seating was seat yourself.  It wasn't crowded so the service was fine but I could see on a busy Friday or Saturday the service would be less than stellar. We drank a beer (they only have bottled beers) and sat by the river to watch the boats go by.  The beers are pricy as our Curious Traveler Shandy was $6.50 each but it was a perfect drink for a hot day!  The menu is mostly seafood and pricey-the buffalo shrip where you only get 5 was $11.  It was only 3pm so we went with an appetizer of cheese fries with bacon and ranch-delicious and how could you go wrong! The fries had a tasty seasoning on them.,1

My sausage and pepper pizza was a thin, tired looking, dark red sheet of cardboard.  The best part were the crushed red peppers the waiter eventually brought because they had both a nice kick and a nice flavor to them.  \n\nYou don't have the excuse I did.  You have already shown you are smart by using Yelp and if you still got to this place and are disappointed, you'll have nobody to blame but yourself.",0

So was excited about coming in for lunch and trying some of the food.\n\nI ordered the Chicken and Shrimps Silver Noodles. I was in the mood for a nice hearty noodle dish for lunch. This dish delivered on point!!! They were not skimpy on the protein either chicken or shrimp, nice amount of vegetables from bean sprouts, carrots, cabbage, and the clear noodles again nice portion size. I really liked the sauce not really heavy gravy sauce but more light sauce. Not over powering. All the vegetables had nice crunch, al dente, and looked eye appealing just looking at it. It reasonable price. Menu is pretty diverse with lots of pictures just in case not sure.\n\nThe service was excellent. I got seated soon as I walked in. Never had empty glass. The decor is pretty interesting. It had bland look too it. Sure the walls are painted so nothing like cafeteria style. On one side of the walls there couple widescreen televisions. Other then that and one sculpture that sit on the counter. Odd. Yet they have modern look between the light fixtures above and the seats. If you walk in never think going into Thai restaurant. Good or bad? It all about the food for me. In Thai Style Noodle House case am FAN. No doubt plan on making it regular lunch spot for me and trying more of the menu.",1
2199,"The hotel was nice, the room price was great for a weekend with a lot of big stuff going on (CMA Awards, NHRA, Final Four).  Housekeeping was on top of everything.

All the other MGM Hotels have 2-5 pools, this just has one.  \n\nHowever, I travel a lot for business. I've stayed in 5 star luxury hotels and Roach Motels. I have NEVER stayed at a hotel that didn't have a coffee maker and/or a fridge in the room. NYNY rooms were newly remodeled and didn't have either. No coffee maker? No fridge? All the resturaunts serve huge portions, but you can't take any leftovers with you because you don't have a fridge. You have to go down to the casino and spend $6.00 on a crappy coffee because there isn't even a single-cup maker in the room! I guess this is typical now of Vegas.",0
2200,"Bianco's is the best marketing ploy in the city, well except the Powerball. It is no wonder it consistently makes number one on the Zagat's (clearing throat, then spit) list.

I want a reservation. I prefer an invitation by my host with RSVP. Bianco's is yet another example of our consumer need to suffer (see review of Los Dos) \""""Seinfeld-style\"""" -- if you haven't seen the Chinese restaurant episode, you've got to; you can easily satisfy your need for suffering and you don't even have to leave your couch or wander far from your clicker.\n\nI love Bianco's pizza.

There is no other place in Phoenix to taste this kind of pizza. I just wish someone could execute it better -- his wife?\n\nOh wait. I forgot; it already is the hottest restaurant in town. Why would they change a fantastically successful equation? Consumers consume. You want to find out why you have to wait 3 hours. You want to do it yourself. So does every tourist coming here to be surprised that Phoenix actually has paved roads and that we drive cars on them. They've booked their jeep tours from their suburban cookie-cutter somewhere far away, but don't realize that it's an hour drive to the desert. Yeah, you know that was you.\n\nDo I have to remind you that you have to arrive at Bianco's an hour before the restaurant even opens to wait in line to put your name on the list to then wait next door for 3 hours to get a table? You will still have to wait because large parties get to eat ahead of you. I have to wonder. Would this place be so famous if they had seating for 100-120 like most other successful dining rooms around town? Would folks still flock there to spend their ENTIRE evening waiting for a table?\n\nI'll wait and see. I've already fulfilled my duty as consumer and subjected myself to the suffering that is Bianco's. I've done it. What's next? Who's going to provide my next packaged-up roller-coaster ride? Come on.

Our server, Brendan, was clearly knowledgeable about the beers (noting their alcohol contents, nuanced flavors/characteristics, pairings) and provided polite and timely service. Our food was delicious! Brendan also gave my husband and I a FREE and absolutely scrumptious homemade pop-tart: chocolate cherry, so GOOD. I will let my photos speak for themselves.

2209,"Okay, I do not hand out one stars very often... Here goes:\n\nFirst I want to say we were a party of 7 and there was a 2 top that was there and a 8 top that already had their food. \n\nFood: Last time I checked there weren't potatoes in Minestrone soup. However my vegetable soup (Minestrone) had decent flavor, not very many vegetables. My husband had the special, Linguine Pescatore (assorted seafood, scallops, shrimp, mussels, calamari)... he ate it all no complaint. My cousin had some Angel Hair Pasta dish, one bite pushed it aside and wouldn't take another bite. What kind of waiter doesn't inquire what is the matter? (she was worried about sending food back) My friend said the meatballs had good flavor. Another said the Veal Parmesan was really salty. \nService: There was a guy, I think he was the Busser, he had a pony-tail. He was very helpful and ran his tail off. We waited a really long time for our food. It did warn us on our menu that the food takes awhile  because it's made to order... I get that, but it was longer than I have EVER waited. Our Waiter was not very helpful and only saw him 2 times... he took our order and brought our check. (I will get to that later)\n\nBeverages: House Cabernet at 9.00 a glass... I probably could have bout the case at Costco for that price.  Not the most generous pour, then again why would I want more of it. My husband and another gentleman had 6 beers (total)  54.00 before tax and tip. There are no prices on their beer selection. \n\nNow this is where the real issue comes in... \n\nThey do not have a computer, so the writing on the check is really messy. If we didn't try to separate our check ourselves we wouldn't have noticed that they charged us for 8 meals instead of 7. He took the check and counted the meals on the check and then pointed his finger as if a teacher in pre-school counting the 7 of us. I think I can count, he served us, he should know how many of us there was. I am hoping it was an accident. My issue is that he only brought out 7 plates... he didn't even bring us 8. So I am questioning his honesty. Then he deducted the 24.00 for the mistake from the total. I had to ask him to deduct the tip and tax for the meal also. \n\nBottom line, if one of the guys that he gave the check to just slapped down his credit card without looking the waiter could have pocketed another 26.50, besides that 51.00 he got for the tip that was added in. \n\nService was terrible,  Most of the food not worth they money. Atmosphere was super quite and dreary. I found this place on Yelp, I am very disappointed fellow Yelpers!!!!",0
2210,"A friend and I went on a Thursday night.  The place was busy.  We finally found a place to sit at a high-top table alongside others we didn't know, and waited for a server.  This blonde young girl wearing a communicating devise (obviously works there) comes up to the end of the table flirting with others at the end of the table.  My friend and I wave for her attention thinking she was the server.  She looks at us with a surprised and disgusted look.  We say that we would like to order some food, she replies, \""""and?  I'm a hostess.\""""  And walks away.  Amazingly she did get us a server, whom was very nice.  The food is good, even though they screwed up my order and left off some of the items that come with the plate I ordered.  The crowed was young like young 20 something's.   I doubt I'll go back.",0
2211,"It's like a tiny part of my years in Japan, or a stolen Post Street Japantown shopping area from San Francisco!  A nice selection of fresh food, Japanese sweets and cooking reagents, as well as various home products.  Did I mention the fresh buns and breads and sushi?  Good!",1
2212,"They serve breakfast and lunch. It's right in your hotel at Mandalay Bay. It is basic. \n\nWe had a dining credit due to our room being overbooked so we came down here to spend the rest on breakfast before we checked out. \n\nThe concierge told me this used to be the Mandalay Bay's 24 hr restaurant. Now it closes in the afternoon and has a very limited breakfast and lunch menu. \n\nSince it is an only partially operational restaurant, we stuck with safe breakfast options - eggs bacon toast and French toast. The bacon was tasty. The rest was meh but we were glad to have it in our tummies. \n\nThe restaurant has a nice ambience and decor - kind of tropical. It's a shame they don't operate it all of the time and with a full menu. \n\nI noticed the side of toast only came with 1 slice. I thought that was odd.",0
2213,DELISH!  \nIt's hard to find 'good Italian' west of NY.....\nThis place meets the craving for sure!\nThe 'complimentary cheesy bread' offers a warm welcome upon sitting down.\nThe food is reasonably priced and the serving sizes are great - not too big / not too small.\nThey always offer a little post-meal Sambuca.\nThey make you feel at home.\nThe place is small - but cozy and warm.  You truly feel like you are at an italian restuarant.\nWouldnt call it kid friendly due to the size.\nLove the menu on wheels.......,1
2214,"super delicious. The best part? it's right next door to us. So glad we finally get a decent soul food in LAS VEGAS PERIOD. Whether you dine in or do a take out, it;s sure to be a tummy filled meal.",1
2215,"Everytime I walk into this place and see the guy with the with the glasses & a condescending  look on his face I want to walk OUT! I've given him 5 chances to be a decent human being and just take my order and keep his complaining, cocky remarks to himself.  EVERY time he fails. He acts like I'm inconveniencing him and gives me an IDGAF attitude. Get this waste of space away from your customers Pancheros or you're gonna lose business! P.s FOOD IS GREAT!",0
2216,I like the Gelato here and it's oooooookay in price but everything Is outrageous. I don't care for Tootsie lollipops but twenty something dollars for tiny lollys with bling bling Is just Re-dunkualous! I refuse to pay for over priced candy just because Kimmy Kardashian says so.,0
2217,"Came here during my previous trip with the bf. Solid French food all around and reasonable prices (def better than Bouchon).\n\nMain appetizers were the escargots w/butter and mussels.  Not bad, but I've had better escargots and mussels (both lacking flavor).\n\nBF got the special fish of the day which came w/a hearty side of fresh and yummy veggies. Don't remember what kind of fish, but it was moist and tender. Dish was $28\n\nI ordered the sea scallops. There were 5 and they were cooked just right. 2nd best to the ones I ate at Gary Danko in SF. \n\nService was exceptional.  Server was attentive enough, but gave me space. No pressure to order the most expensive items on the menu. Water was filled when low and bread was replenished when asked. Basic things but sometimes people don't do it!\n\nCan't wait to come back during my next Vegas trip!:)",1
2218,"Came here this past Friday for my friend's bachelorette party. We love Tao that's why we wanted to kick off the trip there. Music was great as always. The crowd was awesome, everyone is all from out of town so we're all just trying to have a good time. No lines and open bar and table. It was great!:)",1
2219,It was alright.  I know it's not bellagio buffet but I expected better customer service.  The food was average.  You get what you pay for.  But the service.. well.. not that great.  We had to keep hunting our waiter down to get drinks and refills.  Don't think I'll come back any time soon.,0
2220,"They did a FANTASTIC job!\n\nLet's start from the beginning...Ed showed up on time for the quote. He measured everything and then showed the hubby and I all the types of grass he offers. He was not pushy at all or up selling the more expensive grass. He let us take our time to make our choice. \n\nSo after 3 quotes Ed offered the best price and we were ready to set a date.\n\nThe day of, Ed and team showed up on time and got to work right away. Hubby asked questions as always (lol) and left for work knowing everything would be completed to his liking. He was right!!!! The front and back yard came out breath taking and looks amazing. It looks so real!!! All his employees were very professional and cleaned up everything as if nothing had been completed. All that was left was a beautiful landscaped yard. \n\nI highly recommended this company to anyone. The work is amazing and they were friendly and great to work with. Anymore yard work I need (ideas already swirling in my head) I will not hesitate to call them.\n\nBTW...they don't just do fake grass, they do all kinds of landscaping (walkways, fire pits, waterfalls, etc).",1
2221,"Excellent food and service! We had yellow curry and #37 (can't remember the name) ice tea was fantastic and although they do not sell it, waitress sent me with a to go cup! Also gave us complimentary dessert-fried bananas were delicious!",1
2222,Thought we would give this another try as we keep hearing how great of a place Down Under is. We had been to Down Under twice before.  I guess we just expect more out of a place that charges 'so much'. We sure felt that we got 'so little'.  More of a 'red neck' joint than a true 'wine bar'.  Still UN-impressed.,0
2223,"I really want to like this place. The people who work here are great, but it has been so hit and miss throughout the years. During busy times (like lunch), they've given the sandwich I've ordered away more times than I can count. \n\nBut my biggest complaint is that, if you order an unwitch, they only put use one measly piece of lettuce. This is supposed to replace the bread, folks! I've never been to a Jimmy John's that does such a terrible job with their unwitches. It's so frustrating, because it's such an easy fix. Please, add more lettuce to your unwitches and figure out a system (like giving each customer a number) so that you don't give away people's sandwiches!!!",0
2224,"Moved out from California a couple of years ago and had been looking for a shop where you can shake the owner/mechanics hand and know that you are paying him directly for the services provided.  This is the place.  Carbs serviced on a ninjette, CBR lowered for the wife, tires installed (Michelin sends me birthday cards because I buy so many).  Dillon is spot on and I'll continue to take my bikes to him.",1
2225,"Checked in here yesterday for some good home style food.  At least that's what all the reviews say, right?  Let's just start off by saying that they truly do treat you like family.  Service was very warm and they're genuinely glad to see you there.  I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs.  Great flavor and I absolutely loved the texture of all the caramelized onions and crispy corned beef hash.  Very good.  I also was curious to see what all the hype was about the Pots of bread.  Meh, it was ok, but to me, nothing to write home about.",1
2226,"You guys have no idea how long I debated whether or not to leave a review for Little Woody. It was pretty much a goal of mine to keep it as secret for as long as I possibly could, mostly because the place isn't that big, I live across the street, and I appreciate at least a foot of personal space.  Welp, that foot of personal space is almost gone now so I figure it's about the time to profess my love for this not-really-a-dive bar, especially since they just added the most AMAZING back room a bar has EVER had.\n\nSeriously, I could set up a cot, eat, drink, and sleep in that back room and have absolutely no problems in life. They have shuffleboard, darts, and SkeeBall! Really, what more can you ask for?  In my original review of The Great Escape (R.I.P., gone but not forgotten), I concluded with \""""If they had shuffleboard, I'd bump them up to 5 stars\""""...Little Woody did me one better and got shuffle board while simultaneously getting rid of that weird old person basement smell the place used to have (and replacing it with the lovely smell of wood).  \n\nWhat really makes this bar though is that everyone is seriously so freaking friendly. Once a guy asked me to punch him in the stomach...SUPER friendly because I love punching people.  Another time we sat down at a random table and played a game of RCL with a group of complete strangers, obviously awesome.  One stranger let me play with his iPhone 5 the day it came out just because I noticed it. I've only been mean-mugged like once and those girls clearly got lost looking for Mint, so that's not the Wood's fault.\n\nAll in all, I love this bar, I can now loudly declare that I love this bar, and if you want to come and be cool and love this bar with me you can. Just leave the mean-mugging in Old Town.",1
2227,I purchased a Groupon to us this vendor. \nThey are rude and they left my home in a mess. They came in with dirty shoes and no coverings for them and left dirt in my home. The guy is rude and when I did not want to upgrade he got even ruder. \nHopefully by adding this review they will learn cheap service on an offer such as this will never gain them repeat business.,0
2228,"Won't be running this again... negatives out-numbered the positives\n\nPositives:\n1) Running under the lights in Las Vegas was a cool experience\n2) It's Vegas, there's lots to do before and after the race... good times.\n\nNegatives (in no particular order):\n1) Corrals were not enforced... people who wanted to walk during the first mile should not have started up front with the elite runners... \n2) Lack of volunteers to guide crowds and keep people informed\n3) Not enough shirts at registration... blamed on running at night.  Don't believe this for a second. You have X runners, you order X+1 number of shirts...\n4) Swag bag was lacking\n5) Timing of race (sunday night) + strip closed an extra 1-2 hours + lousy post-race food = very few places for thousands of hungry runners to eat afterwards\n6) Quite simply, everything about this race was too crowded and poorly executed to justify the cost involved.  Oh yeah, and they made me pay to get my splits sent to friends... talk about nickel and dimed\n7) After recruiting several friends to run with me, I got left off the email list with the final info, including the one with the waiver attached....not cool.\n\nI can't speak to the water issue, and I won't give away my secret for eating well afterwards (hint, I got in a cab at NY,NY and headed west on Tropicana)... but unless I get an apology and an assurance that they will make some serious improvements, I won't be participating in this race, especially if they plan to increase the number of runners.",0
2229,"I really dislike this entire chain.  I have eaten a few and have not been impressed.  They make these burritos look huge by packing them in flavorless overcooked rice then put a few ingredients on.  They have additional items that you can buy a la carte to put on your burrito to add flavor, but you'd think they would be included.  This is Tex-Mex cafeteria food.",0
2230,"Sorry Freed's you have diminished since your move to Henderson. I used to frequent Freed's when they were on the East Side of town. \n\nI went here today with my mother for two reasons:\n\n1. I wanted a delicious treat\n2. I am getting married and was interested in looking into their wedding cakes\n\nFirst off the shop IS nice. It is clean, everything smelt so yummy when we walked in. The place where (I assume) they do consultations for wedding/event cakes, etc was behind a glass panel. My mother and I walked in and all the women were busy so we started taking a look at their books with pictures of cakes.\n\nEventually someone came up to us and asked us if we had been helped. I said no and proceeded to ask this person about whether or not they make traditional French wedding cakes. These wedding cakes are called croquembouches. Considering Freed's makes many other things besides cakes I assumed they would at least KNOW what a croquembouche WAS. Well, this lady had no idea what I was talking about. I don't mean to be a snot, and I'm certainly not a snob, but seriously... how can you work in a wedding cake consultation place at a bakery that makes many confectioneries and at least not know what a croquembouche is?\n\nAfter my mother and I left the dazed and confused wedding cake woman we went back into the bakery and proceeded to wait a heinously long amount of time to get our 1 piece of red velvet cake and our 1 cannoli. They were good... but not THAT good.\n\nObviously I'm taking my Frenchy wedding cake dreams elsewhere to the many other bakeries/cake makers in Las Vegas who know what a croquembouche is.",0
2231,"They just called me again too.  They keep calling and I have told the guy of the bad experience that I had.  I went to the old Indian School location for a windshield replacement.  They have since moved to Cave Creek Road.  Not only did they not hook up my windshield washer line, but I later found that a molding piece was missing.  They either did not re-install it or did it improperly and it blew off.  I was assured a couple of times that they would order the part and call me.....never happened.  I also have been in and spoke to the owner who gave me the same assurances...still SOL.  Poor customer service, yet they still keep calling soliciting my business.    The last call reminded me that I should write a Yelp review",0
2232,"I usually find going to Town Square to be a pain in the butt.  However, sometimes this is the best meeting location for people coming from all over town.  Had a very good dinner here for a large group.  Our server was very friendly and efficient.  Everyone enjoyed their dinner without being overly wowed.  Love being able to cross the street after dinner to shop at Sephora.",1
2233,The food was ok....not as good as it should've been for the price. The wait staff was horrible!! Took forever to get a drink and menu. They disappeared when it was time to place my order. I WILL NOT be back. It was not worth the price,0
2234,"I love this place..something for everyone. For Garlic Lovers - the garlic dip will NOT disappoint. You will ward off all vamps guaranteed. Philly cheesesteak/chicken lovers...unforgettable. Lemon chicken salad amazing (HUGE grilled  chicken strips), tuna pizza..odd maybe..but delicious all the same. Need I go on?.the only thing i didn't care for was the veggie burger oddly enough. For an exceptional veggie burger I would steer you towards Four Peaks Brewery. But other than that they are spot on everytime all the time. Can't go wrong!",1
2235,"I would have preferred 0 stars for this hotel. \nOur entire stay here was horrible. Upon arrival, they did not take our luggage to the room. The concierge was very rude with attitude. No one was available after 9pm to assist us with hotel room problems. Our hotel room was dirty. The spa double charged us for a massage so be on the look out for this. They gave us a key that wouldn't open our room and we had to call security. The whole hotel smelled horrible.\nOverall, I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! Cosmo seemed much better.",0
2236,"Perfect breakfast, brunch, or lunch. I had the monte cristo which was just the right amount of sweet and a great blend of flavors. My husband had the chicken and the egg and it too was delicious. Both the chips and cucumber salad are solid sides. We will be back. Highly recommend.",1
2237,"Attitude from the hostess\nOlives in the salsa\nDrinks not refilled!\nFood took 30 minutes to come out on a slow night.\nServer neglected us the entire time\nWe asked for the manager.. after waiting 10 minutes we decided to just pay and leave\nAnother 10 minutes for our check to come back. Still, manager never showed up\n\nI'll never go back again.",0
2238,"I took my other half out for a quiet, romantic date tonight. At the suggestion of fellow Yelpers, I decided to surprise him with the Local Bistro, which neither of us had eaten at before. \n\nWe both loved it! The decor inside is very simple and elegant, with a wide, open dining room encased with wine stacks. We ended up eating on the patio, which considering the beautiful weather was wonderful. I didn't notice any heater or misters on the patio, though, so hopefully they get something in place in time for the summer. \n\nWe had the drunken bread and it was delicious. It only lasted on our table for maybe two of us before it was devoured entirely. You can definitely taste the wine, which I enjoy, I know some people don't...\n\nI ordered the truffle mac n' cheese, which, if I'm honest, puts this same dish at the Yard House to shame! The sauce is so creamy, yet with a strong presence of the truffle oil. I ordered mine with chicken and would recommend also perhaps adding pancetta, since the dish is pretty light without any protein. In any case, it was so good that my man kept eating off my plate and I was scraping the bowl clean.\n\nHe ordered the chicken parmigiana, which he liked a lot, especially the homemade marinara. It also came with a small arugula salad, which was not our favorite. \n\nAt the end of our meal, our server, Paul recommended that we use open table to get reservations in order to avoid getting seated on the patio.  We actually HAD made reservations for this dinner, but our table was given away. When I told him this, he became upset and went inside, only to emerge a few minutes later with a free desert.  It was a custard served with wafers, nutella and raspberry wine sauce. I will order that before every meal from now on. It was fabulous and we really appreciated the gesture. \n\nThis place also has a great brunch menu so we hope to be back soon!",1
2239,I normally HATE chain places and is never eat at Red Lobster but a friend went and got married at the court house and had his wedding dinner there so I had no choice.  I studied the menu and just hit the coconut shrimp with the seafood Alfredo!  It was so good I've been back three times this month.  Very fresh.  Free cheddar biscuits and a great salad with chunky blue cheese not all just ice burg lettuce!  Very fresh and hot!  Service was good too!  Servers seemed happy not just like they were tolerating being there!  GREAT parking lot!  And it's right off highway!,1
2240,"Smoke smoke smoke!  Needed a place to snag a couple of sticks while I was out with the guy's in the family.  Decent booze selection and LV prices in the humidor, but they did have a reasonable variety.  Would probably stop by again if I'm feeling the need.",0
2241,"Caleb is the best!  I work at the salon up the street, and this place is always nice to walk into.  My boyfriend has been coming here, and the customer service is top notch.  He was a hardcore tobacco chewer for 15 years and hasn't bought ANY since he started vaping.  The knowledge here is top notch.  Very welcoming to beginners.  I recommend everybody here for starter sets or flavors.",1
2242,We will go back... I was disappointed in their Halibut tacos and when asked said I wouldn't order them again.  But.. I can't have dairy so the sauce was not included to accommodate my request.  The sauce was where the seasoning and flavor was.  \nThey took my order off the bill and offered a free desert which my husband could only have ( he loved there pumpkin spice cake)\nIt's nice to go to a resteraunt where the staff actually cares about the customers. \nLove them!,1
2243,"Well - I only write reviews in 2 instances:  1. the food and/or experience was totally awesome and would warrant a revisit.  or 2. the complete opposite - the food and/or experience was dismal and disappointing.  Sadly GR Pub and Grill was the latter. \n\nI am a huge GR fan and was very excited in trying Mr. Ramsay's inspired menu and experience his detail to service. We arrived around 1:15pm for lunch and waited for a few mins while waitstaff cleared a table.  The restaurant was only about 1/4-1/2 full (at best) and yet we still had to wait about 10mins before a waiter poured our water and asked for drink orders.  I ordered a Dark and Stormy and it was waaaay too heavy on the rum and was not served with lime.  To the server's credit - he was very apologetic - rushed to get me a second one.  #2 Dark and stormy was slightly better (less rum)  but still a sub-standard drink which did NOT warrant the $11 price tag.  Again not served with lime - I had to ask for them.  Not.a.great start.  \n\nSo I thought 'ok -we are not here for drinks the food should really speak for itself'. We ordered the deviled eggs per the waiter's suggestion plus I LOVE deviled eggs. I was so psyched to see them on the menu.  I have been known to eat 8-10 in one seating but I digress. With all Mr. Ramsay's emphasis on simplicity - it was lost on this dish.  I thought it was interesting mix of flavors on paper but in reality there was too much going on between the vinegar, bacon and cheese.  Weird texture too with the bits of bacon. The worst was that the egg whites were too firm - like they had been sitting in the fridge for too long or were just pulled out and were not given enough time to soften a little. And the yolks simply did not taste fresh.  Perhaps I have been spoiled by farm fresh eggs.  Nevertheless I was disappointed.  \n\nAh but the entree should be better - right?  Nope.  My lamb burger arrived cold.  Cold fries and cold burger. WTF?! Not only did we wait approximately 15-20mins for the entrees to arrive but the my entire meal was cold.  COLD!  Again the waiter was very apologetic and rushed a second burger out to me.  So this one was warmer but sadly it had absolutely No.taste. None. Could not tell it was lamb.  In Mr. Ramsay's words: BLAND!.  It was not seasoned.  I've had better tasting lamb in the local middle eastern restaurant here in Pittsburgh.  I cannot speak to my mother's dish because it contained gluten but she said her heirloom tomato sandwich was quite good.  So there was one bright spot.  Then again she admits that she really does not care about food e.g. tastes, flavors, experience as much as I do.  \n\nIn conclusion, I had very high expectations for Mr. Ramsay's food and restaurant.  For the prices he charges I should have been WOWed.  Instead I left disappointed and very unhappy.  I do have to mention that the watier was thoughtful enough to offer a 20% employee discount which brought our lunch total to $59.02 but still a pricey sum for a sub-standard-will-not-return-to-lunch.  I would not recommend this place.  Sigh.  \n\nHappy Dining,\nKK Teh",0
2244,"I absolutely hate this goddamn grocery store! The are around St Henri is becoming more and more gentrified, bringing money and life into the piss poor neighborhood, and yet these assholes at Toppetta seem to be resisting it. The food is overpriced and almost always spoiled, the meat section uses all the cheats to make their meat look fresh; I have had meat that was glued together, and stunk to all hell. The cashiers are miserable miscreant who refuse to speak a word of English, despite the influx of Anglos and I now go out of my way to shop somewhere else and have good service and food that hasn't gone rotten.",0
2245,"I'd give zero if I could. I stopped by today with my wheelchair-bound wife. I asked if I could look inside (trying to see if we could get around with her chair). The bouncer put up his arm and WOULDN'T LET ME LOOK INSIDE.\n\nNot only will I never go here, I hope they go broke.",0

But you had no problem charging for it. I wanted to like this place!",0
2247,"New to the area and decided to try this park based on the reviews. Chapparal Park itself is really nice, and I recommend skipping the dog park portion and just walking your dog through the rest of the park. The \""""active dog\"""" section is too small - maybe an acre and 1/2 for each of the \""""active\"""" and \""""passive\"""" dog areas. The active dog area  was overcrowded and smelled strongly of urine, which is what you're going to get with such a small space. My dogs are vaccinated, but I'm still concerned about health risks from the crowded, unsanitary conditions. There was a good size puddle that several dogs used to relieve themselves in, then other dogs that were playing a game of chase ran right through it. \n\nIt's obvious that the city works really hard to maintain this space the best they can and the grass was in decent shape, but it you're used to larger parks where your dog can really run and you can walk, you'll be disappointed. Overall, didn't have any trouble with other dogs while we were there and the people seemed friendly enough.",0
2248,"If someone were to ask me about the best thing I've recently ate, I'd say it's Banzo's falafel. \nI didn't have them in pita. Just the balls a la carte.\nNow I get why people love this place. These super fluffy inside, crispy-outside falafel are the best that I've ever had anywhere.

2250,"I've only come here for the lunch buffet, which is a steal at $15 during the week. Sure, the buffet isn't massive, but they have a lot of options here. It's divided into different types of cuisine such as asian, mexican, and american. Their thai food was actually pretty good. And their dessert is amazing!! I have no complaints there. A plus is that they have wine, beer and coffee drinks that are already included into the price, so you just have to tip them.",1
2251,"Went there for the buffet on a Sunday afternoon. Service was terrible and most of the food in the containers was empty. Was there for more than half hour and they never refilled any of them even though they knew it was empty. When we payed our bill, we complained about the service and the waiter kept calling for the manager and she refused to come talk to us. Do not go here for Indian food. The food is not that great either. There are places that are a lot better. Its fine if you don't  know what good Indian food tastes like.",0
2252,"Ey yo guys, real talk, this place is GAF! They know how to make their katsu hands down. I went with my mom to try this place out because my mom is always down to eat Korean or Japanese food with me, so why not right? I heard about this place from some other yelpers and I was not disappointed! \n\nOne thing I saw pictures of was grinding your own sesame seeds and putting in your sauce or something, so I was curious. What you do is grab a bowl, put in some sesame seeds, and you grind it yourself! You can grind it to the consistency of your desire and I thought this was a fun little activity to do while we waited for our food. \n\nI ordered some karaage with my mom, and surprisingly, it was not greasy or too oily, it was actually really good. The outside was really crispy and the inside was soft. This is a highly recommended appetizer! When our actual entrees came out, it comes with the meat you ordered, rice, soup, and a salad. I ordered the pork and I don't remember the name of it because there were two pork katsu items with different names... But they are the same thing, that's what the server told me. I was confused and so I ended up getting whatever that was. My mom got the chicken and my mom got double the meat I did it seemed, for a dollar less. Nothing to complain about there, just get the chicken next time! Like saw their combos, but from the pictures, I didn't think the extra piece of shrimp was worth the 5 bucks, so I passed. \n\nThe food was amazing my gosh! The breading was so crispy and the meet was tender and juicy. This is definitely the place to get your katsu fix! You might miss the turn though because it's not in a big plaza, but if your food is good, people will find it, and you will find those people. \n\nGive this place a visit!",1
2253,"Let's start with the staff here on the afternoon I dropped in:\n\nInattentive, lazy teenagers whose main concern was to talk to their friends who, yes, did happen to be placing orders. However, that does not give anyone working in a position such as theirs the ability to ignore TWO other customers waiting in line to order. Because the employees here decided it was more important to talk to their friends, I waited 10 minutes just to place my order.\n\nAfter placing my order I then proceeded to wait for another 10 minutes as drink after drink came out before mine. I left with my drink as soon as I got it. I can't even say I liked the boba tea. It was okay, I guess. But I suppose I was just soured from the whole experience, I couldn't even enjoy my drink.\n\nI think this place must be good. Everyone on Yelp raves about it. But my experience was bad. No more Easy Life boba for me.",0
2254,"We signed up for sprint a few months ago. The map they showed us said we would have good reception at our house. Not true. Crappy to no reception. Sprint finally sent us a booster so we could get phone service. Still does not work. Talked to sprint several times. We were to get a call back from retention about disconnecting but never got it. For $340.00 per phone, 3 phones, we could disconnect even though they are at fault for lying about the coverage we would have. if you are thinking about getting sprint, DON'T. It would be a HUGE mistake. I tell everyone I meet to stay clear of the worst cell phone service in Las Vegas.",0
2255,"If it weren't for my once-a-year loyalty/obligatory appearance to the Phoenix Texas Exes college football game-watching party, I would have never been scooted into this, what amounts to, downtrodden dive.  I feel bad for saying it because when they hosted this event, they had no idea how far over their heads they would be with this contingent (particularly since it was the first game of the season and it was on PPV).\n\nThey were woefully understaffed, the AC broke, ran out of Shiner Bock, and couldn't get the broadcast well into the Longhorns suckage of the 2nd qtr.  UT could have lost that clunker and I blame Lager Fields.\n\nFood was okay.  Small patio for outdoor seating.  TV arrangement was serviceable.  Staff was VERY nice and apologetic.  Two stars for the effort and one for stocking the Shiner Bock.  I won't be back though.",0
2256,"Target has a promotion they call Holly Jolly Savings.  It is promoted as spend $50 on Holiday items and get $10 off at the register. Sounds easy enough!  I fill my shopping cart with holiday Items and get to the check out..  My total was $171.80.  I showed the cashier my coupon, she scanned it  and told me my purchases did not qualify.  Really?,.....I ask how much more do I need to spend to qualify?  She does not have a clue but suggested I inquire at the customer service desk.  I go to the customer service desk and the clerk also has no clue to how the promotion works, but he was somehow sure I did not qualify.  I told him I would no longer be shopping at Target and he smiled and wished me a good day.  Officially added Target to my do not shop there anymore list along with Sears and Kmart..  I added a star as they have incredible shopping carts.",0
2257,"I was so excited to see a Pink Box Donuts coming to this location, as it is close to where I work. I'd seen them on some food show, and saw all the rave reviews. \n\nMy test of a donut shop is how good their plain raised donut is. After all, if you don't have a good base, none of your donuts will be good. So, I got a plain raised and some sort of turtle cheesecake donut. \n\nI took the plain one out, turned it over and took a sniff. No, I don't have a donut fetish. What I want to smell is that nice, yeasty fresh donut smell. Nope. All I smelled was sugar.  Let me backup to say that when I walked into the shop, I was surprised that it didn't have that \""""OMG fresh baked donut\"""" smell. Now I know why. \n\nSo, tasting the plain donut was an adventure only my dentist would love. It tasted like nothing but sugar. The glaze had to be the sweetest I've ever tasted. Usually glaze is powdered sugar and some sort of liquid - milk, melted butter, lemon juice, whatever. What did they do, mix their sugar with corn syrup?  So, giving up on the plain after a couple bites, I went to the turtle cheesecake one. I will say the cheesecake filling was nice, but again the donut itself had no flavor. The topping was pretty good but again very sweet. \n\nI'm disappointed and expected more after everything I've seen and read. You can't cover a mediocre donut with a bunch of toppings and sugar and call it good.",0
2258,"I've only hiked Camelback once, but I felt so accomplished (albeit winded, and mere minutes away from passing out).\n\nWe started the hike at 6 in the morning, and got to watch the sunrise while we made our way up the trail.  I thought it wasn't going to be a bad hike, but things get tougher about two-thirds up.  Things starting getting vertical at some points, and I wasn't really prepared for that.\n\nIt was totally worth it once we got to the top, though - gorgeous, 360 view of the Phoenix metro area (and really, much more than that).  And watching the sunrise with someone special is pretty awesome too.",1
2259,The fact that they have iced tea that tasted like someone pissed in it should have been our first clue. \n\n We went here on 10/29 before a movie we decided to split a steak sand which.  First of all the girl ringing us up acted like it was an inconvenience that we were even there.  We asked for the sandwich without some of the stuff they put on it obviously this was too hard to do. When we received or order are steak was pink it was more like roast beef than a Philly steak sandwich it was totally cold the cheese was not melted at all. I could have had a better sandwich from Arby's at least they actually care about horrible service. The onions were not even saut\u00e9ed they were just placed on the sandwich. The green peppers were cold\n\nThe cleanliness of the place was absolutely atrocious there was not one piece of counter space that did not have food on it.  I understand about being cool and hip but since when is dirt and grease and pure filth a food additive. \n\nI will be calling on Monday to speak to the manager and then I will decide if Ineed to call the health department.,0
2260,"After posting my review, I received a response from the owner that included a copy of my receipt showing that he had credited me $10 for the dessert issue mentioned in my review.  He ended with this sentence, which seems to indicate that I shouldn't give his restaurant another try:  \""""Thank you for your past patronage and I wish you the best in your future dining experiences elsewhere.\""""  An odd response, particularly when it appears that I am not an outlier in terms of my service experience.",0

2264,"What the pho, man?!\n\nThe food is bland.  It tastes like they cater to the elderly.\n\nThe prices are high for the type of food you are getting.  Nobody should have to bay over $5.75 for ANY type of pho.  \n\nI've gone there 2x and I don't know if it's just me, but the hostess there just rubbed me the wrong way both times.  She was cracking jokes and making comments that were borderline inappropriate.  \n\nThey focus more on decor and trying to \""""entertain\"""" their patrons rather than focusing on what's really important... the food.\n\nYou want a really good, AUTHENTIC bowl of Pho?  Go to Saigon Pho on Alma School/Knox.  It's not as ritzy and refined, but the pho and other menu items there are less expensive, tastes better, and they serve you much larger portions.  \n\nEat at Cyclo if you want to have a SEEMINGLY over-attentive hostess bothering you while you try to eat.

2269,"The waiter was nice and very friendly tonight. The bread and salad was good. But the linguini and clams was kinda gross. It was nothing new. The sauce tasted plain and the clams were already on the noodles. It's more spontaneous when you can open the clams yourself. The sauce was also really thick. If it was thinner it would have been better. The cheesecake was alright. I've had better and the portion is really small. I looked at it and said are you kidding me?

I had the tuna but could have chosen pork.  The tuna was wonderful and the soup brought together so many wonderful tastes and textures that I will definitely be searching for Korean food when I get back home!  I began the meal with an order of spring rolls which were crispy as few restaurants can accomplish.\n\nService could not have been better.

Nevertheless, neither the Mandarin Oriental nor the Encore offer the privacy and that true small hotel feel that the Four Seasons offers.  You will not get people that do not belong walking around the lobby.  Now that it has been remodeled, this Four Seasons is a true oasis for those desiring privacy while visiting Vegas.  The remodel is excellent.  The service is good, although the valets could improve, as they are a bit slow, and don't seem to display that Isadore Sharp instilled positive intensity.

The food here rivals what I was used to eating at Hazels Seafood in Half Moon Bay, right off the boat!\n\nFish fillet was thinly coated then flash fried crisp, inside was flakey and perfectly done and served with two types of tartar sauce. My wife and I both preferred the spicy one. \nI highly suggest the Onion Rings instead of the fries or do a combo as they're  very,very good!\nPricing was fair considering the portion size and that it's FRESH fish.

Bread was cross between pita and nan and also excellent. For those who like some spice, there were 2 side containers on each table with a hot sauce and another semi hot sauce with green herbs or something that were both very tasty. \nFresh mint tea for $1.50 and all in all a real find which unfortunately we didn't find till today.

I have yet to find a good shawarma place in Vegas, which is both disappointing and surprising.  Amena Bakery & Deli is the best shawarma I've had so far in the area though.  The Olive was just disappointing all around.  The pitas may have been warm, but they were not pillowy at all, and weren't anything to write home about (Amena's pitas are AWESOME).  The shawarma had an ok flavor, but was kind of dry.  I've had better flavored falafel just about everywhere else I've been, though they did taste fresh, and had a nice texture.  Sadly, my favorite part of the dish was the lettuce, tomatoes, and tahini sauce... just sad.",0

We talk about the game plan, pick out colors, I drop my purse off on the cute little purse stands they have, and she got started on my pedicure first. I may be able to count on one hand how many pedicures I have had, but this was THE BEST pedicure I have every had and feel like my previous pedicures should have lived up to this experience and all future ones better watch out. Not only did it include nail polish, but rose pedals were added to the water, I got a sea salt scrub, and a bomb massage that lasted almost until forever. So amazing on the rare occasion I get a pedicure, I will definitely be calling Sharie up!\n\nI have gotten two gel manicures from Sharie and they both have held up pretty well. Sharie pays attention to detail and knows that my nails don't last long in my profession so when it came time to picking out colors, she told me which ones will last the longest and I greatly appreciate that. Sharie (and well, all the ladies) are so nice and friendly. Its a small salon so everyone is kind of talking to everyone and it feels like a close-knit community, which is something you do not get in those uber cheap chop shop salons. \n\nThe ONLY downside is the low occupancy this place has (3 pedi stations, 4 mani stations) and adding on a friend is almost impossible unless you make an appointment far in advance (which I suck at). As I said, I rarely get my nails done and when I do, I like to go with friends and its usually pretty last minute, which unfortunately, doesn't work with this nail boutique. \n\n I highly recommend Polished for anyone that likes to keep regular appointments, loves amazing pedicures and enjoys quality without the price tag!",1

It took a good half hour before our orders arrived. Considering we were one of only 3 tables of customers when we arrived, this was an excessive amount of time. Fries were cold, \""""critters\"""" were cold, chicken wings were missing and when they did arrive, were not spicy.  The catfish was hot and fresh, however, the three small pieces were mostly cornmeal breading (see pic), certainly not worth the $40  price charged.\n\nWe ended up leaving most of our meal on the plate.  If things don't drastically change, I don't see this restaurant being around in another couple of months.  I would not recommend this business.",0
2298,"I know this restaurant is opened 24/7, but that is, by no mean, an excuse to serve sub-par Korean food, especially when it is centrally located in Chinatown!  \n\nThe three of us ordered the Queen combination, and the amount of food was perfect.  The quality of the food, however, I can't say the same.   Maybe I am used to Korean food being flavorful and so delicious that I can't stop eating, but the combination was just a-ok.  The side dishes were also just a-ok.   **The combination did come with a choice of drink.  We had a bottle of soju, but I couldn't have cared less if the free drink didn't come with it.  \n\nThe service was also sub-par.  Yes, they come to your table and cook the food for you, but I can do that myself!  In fact, it's one of the reasons why I like Korean food!  Also, our water glasses and tea cups were always empty.  I have to ask them to refill it every time.  After the second time of asking, the server pour so much tea that it spilled everywhere.  I am not sure if it was done to prove a point to me, but the thought did cross my mind.  \n\nThe three of us ended up paying $25 each including tips.  For the bang for your money, go somewhere else.  There are plenty of wonderfully delicious Korean food in town, why settle for less?",0
2299,"Maybe I set my expectations too high but my stay last night was a huge disappointment. The Luxor is marketed to be one of the better places to stay, but upon checking in and getting to my room at best it seemed very average. Also, room was not clean (found chewing gum stuck on wall and a used band-aid on window ledge, also lots of garbage behind nightstand). Overall the place seems rundown and old. The Casino was not lively at all, restaurant was average with bad service.... \n\nOverall a disappointing experience.",0
2300,"On standby with nothing better to do but vent my frustrations about an airline that is completely incompetent!  \n\nTo start, my ticket did not have my TSA precheck on it (despite having called and spoken to the us airways rep on the phone the day prior).  My husband had his number, but not mine. So much for my efforts to call and make sure that was taking care of....doesnt help if only ONE of us has pre check. \n\nA journey from oakland to san antonio took nine hours because both of our flights were delayed.  I was accepting because the afternoon flights are not always timely. I forgave and forgot. \n\nHOWEVER....for our 8:45 flight, we woke up early to be on time.  It was still dark as we left our san antonio hotel (which, was awesome. Highly recommend the Mokara Hotel in San Antonio).  Again, my TSA precheck is not on my ticket but after 15 minutes of confusion, the us airways rep FINALLY enabled that.  Fast lane at security so i can go hurry and wait ar the gate. \n\nThen, waiting. And more waiting. For an 8:45 am flight, our odds were more promising. Not so. For some reason, the plane was not ready until 15 minutes after our flight was supposed to leave. Once boarded, another 45 minutes goes by with an announcement from the pilot that the bags were now on the flight. Really?  An hour after the flight was to leave, the first flight of the day, and the bags just got on?!  So that was why we were an hour late?\n\nSo i registered my concern to the stewardess that if our flight was an hour late, we would miss our connecting.  Not much she could do she said.  Finally, we landed and ran to our gate (mind you, we are with our six year old) and get there on the nose.  The gate agent said they closed the doors and we could not get on. Perfect. \n\nSo now my family is waiting another 3.5 hours to catch an alternate plane on standby. We should have been home now.  \n\nI have posted to my facebook that i am forever boycotting this airline. And guess what? my friends are commenting how they have had similar experiences and will never fly us airways!  \n\nI can only hope that we get in this flight, it is not delayed and are bags reach our destination. I may be back to edit this review...\n\nSo i am back to report that after arriving home (finally), we discovered that both of our pieces of luggage were wet inside and out. All clothes had to be washed or dry cleaned. Unbelievable.",0
2301,"LOVE their Rosy Duck. TIP: appetizer portion if 8.99, half duck is 9.99...it is much larger and worth the $1. We get the duck everytime we go.\n\nLunch menu is decent. For 6.99 or so you get a drink, eggroll, soup, wonton, entree, and fried rice. The entree I had (beef and green pepper) wasn't exciting or that great, but I felt it was a good value. \n\nHouse crispy chicken is also amazing.. I will say the house chicken and rosy duck are v. similar, so only order one or the other depending on your particular poultry craving that day.",1
2302,"One of the best buffets I've ever been to!  I hate to admit this (a sin in my family really..) but I am not the biggest fan of buffets.. I admittedly don't eat that much, and I always feel like I'm torturing my tummy to get my money's worth ): Also, they're a wide selection of food that's usually mediocre at best..  Bacchanal (however you pronounce that), however, definitely changed my mind!  Yes, there were MANY MANY choices, but I honestly did not feel pressured to have to eat everything, because the seafood section was amaaazing!  I cannot tell you how many times I went back for more seafood, especially those fresh oysters. And crab legs. So good. Really the highlight of the buffet I thought.  Their carving station was pretty good too, I enjoyed my ribs a lot. But wow. The seafood.\n\nWarning - the wait can be kind of torturous, but they have this electronic system where you sign up on the machine and they text you when you need to come back and get in line, which is kind of nice so you can walk around and do some shopping or gambling while you're waiting.  The wait IS about an additional 15 minutes after they text you though.  Also, the \""""estimated wait time\"""" that they show you after you sign up might not be very accurate.. I'm assuming it's because people drop out. Our estimated wait was 90 minutes, but it only took about 20 for them to text me back. So just be prepared for that!",1
2303,"what a disappointment, i didn't want to risk the AYCE so i decided to go with a combo meal.  6 wings, fries and a drink for 7.95 plus extra for ranch.  As soon as they charged extra for ranch i should have known.  \n\nThe wings were big, but nothing special at all.  i had the parm garlic wings and it was just wings with parmesan cheese sprinkled on it. my friend had hot bbq and the sauce was nothing memorable.\n\ni would recommend wingstop of buffalo wild wings for sure over this place.",0
2304,"Ellis Island, you are dead to me!\n\nOh Ellis Island, I have been a fan for over 10 years. I have been a loyal customer. I have sung your praises from mountain tops. I brought my friends to enjoy the goodness (or should I say former goodness) of your $7.99 steak dinner. But no more! After the experience I had last night, you are indeed now dead to me and hopefully to all the people who read this review.\n\nEllis Island, I stuck with the even after you continually raised the price of your steak dinner from $4.99 to $5.99 to $6.99 to what it is now $7.99.\n\nEllis Island, I stuck with you despite the increasingly awful service...your employees have no sense of urgency nor do they understand customer service.\n\nEllis Island, I stuck with you even after finding out that your \""""center cut sirloin\"""" is indeed just beef scraps combined with meat glue, rolled up into a loaf and cut into \""""steaks.\""""\n\nBut, after the experience I had last night with your obnoxious, insensitive, offensive, bully of a restaurant manager I will never visit your establishment again.\n\nI arrived on a Monday night at 9:15pm very excited and hungry. I was really looking forward to a \""""steak\"""" dinner. We were unenthusiastically \""""greeted\"""" by a hostess who told us there was a 20 minute wait. Odd, the restaurant was more than half empty...in fact the casino was almost empty. The hostess then directed my attention to a printer paper sign stating the kitchen is being cleaned and anyone who arrives after 9:30 pm will only be able to order off of a limited menu. As we were given a 20 minute wait time I asked the hostess if we would be able to get the steak dinner...she said no. I told her we were there now and if we were seated by 9:30, the supposed cut off time, would we be able to order the steak dinner...she said no. I explained we came specifically for the steak dinner, having walked from the strip, and asked if there was any way we could get the steak dinner...she said no. I then asked to speak to the manager.\n\nAfter a long wait the manager finally arrived...with a security guard. Really, a security guard? Please look at my Yelp picture...do I look like a threat? The manager stood about 2 inches from my face and proceeded to tell me No over and over again. He kept interrupting me when I pointed out his restaurant was empty, that the hostess was specifically giving wait times so that that people would have to order off the limited menu, etc. I told him his manner and policies were completely unacceptable. I finally just asked, \""""Am I going to be able to order a steak dinner?\"""" He got even closer to me and yelled, \""""No!\"""" I then informed him that I would make sure to tell everyone about this terrible experience and he yelled in a close and threatening manner, \""""Don't threaten me!\"""" I told him that I was not threatening, just informing him that this is what is going to happen and this is what happens when people receive horrible customer service like this. We then walked out, while the manager continued to yell at us.\n\nAmazing! I have never had an experience like this. Just an FYI to you my Yelp friends...this is the experience you can expect from Ellis Island. Inferior food, inferior service, all served up to you by a manager who is a bully. Enter at your own risk.",0
2305,"Every trip we go for a pint and some Black Bush. Always leave disappointed. Grew up in McSorley's so I'm always looking for something to stir the memories. Not worth the trip unless you're at the Excalibur, MGM or NYNY. It's ain't NY.",0

After just a bit over an hour, we were asked to stop our conversations and leave the table as they needed it for other guests. Never before have I ever been asked to get up and leave even if we already finished eating. \n\nSo - if you want a very quick meal, this is the place to go, if you are looking to enjoy yourself, then I would choose somewhere else.",0

There are many other great places in Pittsburgh to go if you want a yummy fish sandwich. \n\nRedfin Blues has the potential to be such a great restaurant! But with the poor service and average food, it has a lot to yearn for.",0
2308,"First off,it is extremely difficult looking for this place as its in the back of the hospital and there is no sign at all saying that the pediatrics is located there... which is annoying.

She didn't say much and didn't really do anything.. I'm very hesitant to even tske my daughter back here.. as of now I just called to schedule another appt,also not even to mention AGAIN the previous time we were there they didn't even let us know when to come back again,so as of now I called in to schedule another check up.... they open at 8? Yeah I'm pretty sure!  Ring Ring no answer,call again..ring ring no answer.. called 4 times and no answer.

2310,"Went on Saturday, Jan 19, 2013. \n\nGiven the rough reviews of late, we decided to give it a try anyway as my family rooted for Angelo in Top Chef. To keep it brief, we found out he wasn't cooking and was in NYC. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt given its only been 19 days since opening...the staff was running around, giving food to tables that didn't order the food...our food was either waaaay too salty or under seasoned...it was comical almost. Some good points...our server was nice and we were comped 1/3 of our meal, and apologized to by the ma\u00eetre d' numerous times. BUT the bad really shadowed--no--eclipsed it. \n\nWhen you go, you'll be greeted by a large sign with \""""By Chef Angelo Sosa\"""" written boldly. I don't know the reason why he would have his name in that scale and not be there AT THE VERY LEAST for the VERY sensitive opening month that the restaurant needs his guidance the most. It's quite perplexing. \n\nWhat we had: \n1. Pot stickers: good texture, but swimming in sauce and bit sweet\n2. Burger: under seasoned, burnt bun and the fries were so salty.\n3. Kim chi fried rice: I get it that it's nice to have some char but man, dry and seemingly undercooked rice was not the crunch it's suppose to have.\n4. Chicken wings: my kid had this and it was...wow...the breading was wow...not in a good way huge\n5. Tomato soup: it was good...thank goodness\n6. Salad: sorry cant remember which one...but if you can believe this...it was SO salty. SALAD. SALTY. I'm so confused. \n7. Dessert: chips and ice cream was decent and strawberry shortcake was ok. These were comped items.\n8. Tap water: I swear I'm not being a jerk by including this...there is something not right with the water...go ahead try it. It seriously has a bad taste. \n\nI digress. Chef Sosa, I know you're reading this. You need to fly back, like right now. Your name is on the sign.",0
2311,"I had the combo platter with carne asada tacos ($7).  In general I thought the food was tastier than most places, but there were several drawbacks.  The selection is very limited:  Burritos, tacos and quesadillas.  That's it.  I was jonesing for a cheese enchilada.  Denied!  Given the reviews, I was expecting the carne asada to knock me over, however I found it tough and somewhat bland and topped with too many raw onions.  Of note too is that the plates and glasses are styrofoam and the utencils are plastic.  Lastly, I've never paid for chips before, they're $1.50 here, although the rest of their prices seem reasonable.  On the bright side everything else was delicious, even the $1.50 chips.",0
2312,"We drove by this place quite a few times, so we decided to check it out.  I've went to Petes Fish N' Chips before and it was disappointing.  So coming here I thought I was gonna be a little disappointed.  Before you actually get the food, you think that it was gonna be real pricy. I ended up getting 4 piece fish and 4 shrimp ($9.99) with my sides being mac n' cheese and fries.\n\nThe food did take a little while to come out (if you know me, that stuff doesn't bother me, I'm patient like that) but when I got the box, it was so full that they couldn't even close it all the way (good thing it wasn't to go).  I opened the box and the fish was big.  The fries and mac n' cheese were under the fish, oh yeah and hush puppies.  Overall they give you a real good size proportion that fills even people like me up.\n\nNow the fish didn't have a super fishy taste, but it was better than Long Johns and even Petes Fish N' Chips.  The shrimp was delicious, the mac n' cheese was decent, and the fries were tasty. It was our first time, and we even told the cashier.  Even though the meal was a 4 piece fish n' shrimp, they ended up giving us 5 pieces of fish, which was pretty cool on their end.\n\nThe customer service was nice and friendly, and even the cashier was cleaning when it wasn't busy.  You don't see that much nowadays.  This so far is the best fast food seafood place I've been too, and those are hard to find in AZ.",1
2313,"I keep seeing Makino and Todai mentioned in the reviews when people talk about sushi buffets, the problem is these places are not very fresh and in some cases very unsanitary.  Not only is the quality of the fish mediocre, but the people who prepare it usually do not care about the food.  To add insult to injury, the people who prepare the sushi are very minimally trained and almost always mishandle the food.\n\nIf all you can eat sushi is what you're looking for, I strongly suggest hitting up places such as Sushi Mon or Hikari.  You get seated at the bar and give your sushi orders directly to the professional sushi chef who makes it in front of you.  Notice I said professional sushi chef, which is a far cry from the non-trained staff at places such as Makino and Todai.  \n\nThe only decent thing about Makino that I can think of is the variety.  There's noodles, tempura, crab legs (dinner), dessert plates, and a chocolate fountain.  But if all you're looking for is  quality all you can eat sushi and do not care about gimmicks, there's much better joints to spend your money in.",0
2314,"The thing about mussels is that no matter where you get them from, they seem to taste the same every time, with the only real indicator of quality being the level of food poisoning / diarrhoea you find yourself with the following morning. Because of this, I rarely bother with them even though I find mussels incredibly tasty, but The Mussel Inn's lunchtime deal was just too good to resist on a recent visit.\n\nTo be controversial, I actually went for the chowder instead of the mussels, and found it to be utterly fantastic and full of fishy goodness. I wasn't in the mood for wine so just had a coke while E-Bot slugged back her glass of white, but with a big bowl of fries on the side as well, the \u00a37.50 price was an absolute steal.",1
2315,"The restaurant is very nice on the inside compared to the outside. I nice place for a date.\n\nI ordered the tom kah gai and it was very flavorful, not quite as rich with coconut milk as at Thai Rama, but still very good. I ordered medium and this is probably closer to hot. As I ate, I noticed these things I thought were green onion, on further examination, they were small sliced chili peppers. Their rice was nit as fluffy as I usually like, but that's ok. I also got the red curry because the server said it was their most popular curry. Again, very flavorful and tasty. Service was very good, although, they weren't busy at all. Iced tea, was good. I would go again!",1

Bring an appetite and perhaps a bib, you won't be disappointed!",1
2317,"Found ourselves at Bachi after a long weekend, hungry for food that wasn't fast food,  yet not lemme-just-stuff-myself-silly buffet style either. Overall: love the concepts and menu but with a couple hangups!\n\nFOOD: downright delicious. Not gonna lie, I was pretty impressed. We ordered the truffle fries ($5.5) (medium cut, parm cheese, truffle gravy drizzle + sun-dried tomato aioli)...what in the holy hayellllll. This was so amazing! I could eat this literally as a side to every meal. The truffle wasn't overwhelming and I love the substitute of the aioli for like, Heintz ketchup or something. Very classy, Bachi. The Kiki burger ($11) was #1) cutely named and #2) cooked to perfection with the best flavor combo ever! I loved the bun, as it was somewhat sweet and pillowy. It had a mix of mushrooms, a bacon/sweet onion glaze and gruyere cheese. \n\nSERVICE: Not that great. It took a long time to get our food (30+ minutes). We were only 4 girls and didn't order anything out of the ordinary or massive amounts of food. Heck, the restaurant wasn't even that busy.. not all the tables were full, so I'm still a bit stumped why it took so long.\n\nDRINKS: The lychee boba milk tea was aiiiiight. Nothing special. They didn't put enough ice, so it was a bit warm and milky.. not really what I hoped for in 100+ degree weather. The lychee flavor was good though and not overwhelming.\n\nOVERALL: Satisfied, good for a try, not sure if I would go out of my way for this again, but if you do, it'll be a good choice!",1

The pitas - cheese, spinach and cheese, and meat - are so good I could eat them every day.  \n\nThe prices are very reasonable.  \n\nThe interior is so cool - very European and completely unique from any restaurant in Phoenix.  The server we've had all but once, Johnna, (not sure of the correct spelling - sorry!) is a delight!

2319,"I went here because I've had so many friends and colleagues rave about this joint. First of all, it is packed, like literally out the door packed. I come in, give the lady my name (mine was a two person party, much smaller than the five-six people groups coming in), and she tells me it'll be ten minutes tops. Alright, ten minutes rolls by, and people who had come in after us are being seated, and we don't hear anything. I finally confront the hostess, and she makes some bullcrap excuse about me not hearing my name. I was standing right next to her and looking right at her the whole time we were waiting...\n\nSo, we are finally seated, and bad service aside, we thought we'd enjoy the food. Wrong! I ordered something along the line of a polenta benedict with bacon strips. I've made better at home. The polenta was over cooked and dry. The bacon tasted like the way your dog's bacon treat smells. The poached eggs were probably the only thing done right. I also got the Tiffany expresso. It was literally a shot of expresso top with a small dollop of whipped cream and exactly (yes, I counted) seven jimmies. That's it. For 6 dollars. I would not even be so offended had the expresso itself actually been good, but it tasted like the sub-par stuff they give you at Starbucks. You know, the kind that leaves a sour after taste in your mouth.\n\nMy girlfriend's breakfast was just as horrible and unsatisfying. She got the Eastide Western omlette, and it was just bland! Her cappuccino was entirely tasteless as well..\n\nThis place is not at all worth the hype, time, money, or horrible service you get. Do not be fooled by the flashy colours and your friends' lies! If they tell you this place is good, they probably have horribly low expectations in dining.",0

2323,I'm definitely a fan of this restaurant.  I was at the mall for a few hours tonight and decided to stop by Kylos Greek Cafe again.  I've been here several times in the past when I've had a groupon and totally loved it then.  I got the gyros combo with fries and a drink.  I got the supreme which was about 13 buck and it came with feta cheese and lettuce.  \n\nThe portion size is pretty large for the price and it definitely filled my stomach.  It is kinda messy if you try to eat it with your hands like you would a normal gyro.  I end up just eating it with my gold plated tiffany fork that I bring with me when I plan on eating out.  So I adverted the mess on my hands.  For mall food it's not bad compared to the other restaurants that barely survive,1

On the strip and even downtown, it's getting harder and harder to find a $5 21 table on the weekends. \n\nI'm wondering when Station Casinos is going to let go of this property and build a resort that has something to offer - that draws people in because the current property doesn't have much in that way in my opinion.",0

2328,"What an amazing display of inept service.  With some difficulty, we ordered glasses of prosecco to enjoy before dinner (The waiter did not offer to take drink orders or provide us with a by-the glass menu). The prosecco failed to arrive until well after our salads, which appeared almost instantaneously.  We had only taken a few bites of our salad, and sips of our prosecco, when the entrees arrived.  Rather than returning them to the kitchen, the waiter pressured us to relinquish our less than half-eaten salads. We didn't put up too much of a fight as the caesar salad was not particularly enticing.  RIght on the waiter's heels, the sommelier appeared with the nice bottle of chardonnay that we had ordered.  It was completely unchilled. Rather than refusing it as we should have, we allowed him to talk us into pouring a small sip with the promise that he would rapidly chill the remainder.  At that point, the waiter, sommelier, and our bottle of chardonnay disappeared into oblivion while we finished our entrees, sans wine.  Only well after we had finished picking at our entrees did the waiter reappear. We had to ask him to please fetch our wine, which he did unapologetically. As you can probably guess, the wine was still completely warm.  He proceeded to pour a glass for each of us and then started to leave with the bottle in hand.  At this point, my wife nearly jumped up to tackle him, fearing that if he escaped with the bottle we would never see him or our warm wine again.  So we were left to drink our nearly full bottle of unchillled chardonnay and laugh about the strange debacle we had just experienced.  Unfortunately, for $200+ there are probably much better comedy acts on the strip.  There are certainly many better dining options.",0
2329,"This place is listed on here 3 times - as this one had the most reviews, I decided to post here.  \n\nI LOVE B&Bs that don't feel like B&Bs.  The traditional B&Bs are run out of someone's house - meaning shared bathroom and awkwardness in mingling with people you have no desire to be BFFs with.  Auberge Les Bons Matins feels more like a hip hotel than a B&B.  We fell in love with it immediately.  \n\nFirst off, the fellow at the desk was really friendly and helped us hunt for parking, as that was unsuccessful, we opted to \""""cough up\"""" the $11 CAD and park in the little lot out behind.  The sarcasm is that parking in Montreal is EXPENSIVE and we easily paid $40 elsewhere on a previous trip.  So this was worth it - not only was the price right but it was gorgeous back there and I'm sure our car was happy with the scenery.  It truly felt like we were in the suburbs and not downtown Montreal.  \n\nWe had a beautiful room - stayed in Suite 705.  Super clean and beautifully decorated.  The trains did start rumbling in the morning at about 6 am but we were not far from waking up anyway so it was not a big deal.  My only gripes about the room were this - 1) the toilet was on the other side of a glass door with a sheer white curtain.  We're not really into having a 'shared' bathroom experience so opted to leave the room if the other was in it.  That might just be us.  2) VERY creaky bed!!!!  Forget relations - I think the whole building would have heard.  The mattress wasn't a good quality one either - I'm not fussy but this one was definitely on the low end.    \n\nThe location is amazing - only a couple of blocks to bustling St Catherine Street and I could literally throw a rock and hit the metro.  This proved really handy - we left our car and simply hopped the metro to the show and dinner we planned for that night.\n\nBreakfast was wonderful and quite friendly.  Best dang waffle I think I have ever had...   \n\nAll in all, this place is a gem and perfect for couples!  Highly recommend it for your next trip to Montreal!",1
2330,"I am actually very content with their Japanese desserts. My personal favorite and must have when I'm in the area is the green-tea mouse cake. I've had better in LA but considering I am currently located here and its actually good, it definitely hits the spot when the craving arises for Asian desserts. The people are friendly and willing to explain what is in everything and are very attentive.",1
2331,"Sooo, my hubby and I finally decided to see what this whole frozen hot chocolate hype was about... Was it worth it? Not for $10! All it was to me was a milkshake. Maybe I chose the wrong flavor, which was strawberry but none the less I expected way better for the price! My hubby got the one with peanut butter and he couldn't finish it because he said it was too rich and his was $11!  \n\nBreakdown: \njalape\u00f1o cheddar pretzel: 5.99 not bad but not crazy good\n\nNacho cheese dip: $0.50\n\nSmall Strawberry frozen hot chocolate: $10 tasted like nestle quick, never again\n\nSmall peanut butter frozen hot chocolate: $11 too rich and too sweet!\n\nTotal with tax for this little snack: $34 and some change! Ridiculous? I think so! Now I don't want to bash it too much because we only tried the to go menu, which was very limited but to be honest nothing on the sit down menu really wowed me either so I highly doubt I'll be giving them a second chance. They are know for their frozen hot chocolate, which to me was a major bust so my work here is done! Sorry serendipity you're just not for me!",0

2334,"This place was awful, just awful. \n\n1) Value is horrible. The prices look good but the pizza sizes are actually VERY small. A large at sano is maybe a medium at normal pizza shops at best. I usually get 2 larges for my family, 2 larges from sano did not feed everyone like usual.\n\n2) They are very skimpy on toppings (we got meat lover pizza). \n3) Very little sauce on the thin thin crust. \n4) Taste was average. \n\nOverall my whole family was very disappointed. We had to go somewhere else because our order was way too small. pizza wasn't even good. will not be returning.

2335,"Yum, Yum and......did I say, \""""Yum!?\"""" I've been here several times and have never been disappointed.  I met my girlfriend for lunch the other day, and as usual, the service was quick, the food good, (with large portions), and the cost very affordable.  I had the Sedona panini and it was really good! Definitely a \""""go-to\"""" eatery!  Parking can be a little tight, just be careful!",1
2336,"If you like high quality sushi this place is for you. Don't get me wrong, it is pricey. But if you're in Las Vegas it's worth it to enjoy a nice dinner. The ambiance is beautiful with the chandeliers, tables, and chairs. The windows on one side overlook the pool. Everything we had was amazing. We had a few sushi items as appetizers including the albacore sashimi with crispy onions and soup. My entr\u00e9e was the sea bass, which was cooked to perfection. The desserts were unbelievable, we had a combination of three different ice creams and fruit with shaved ice, which was prepared at the table. The staff were very courteous and respectful. I definitely recommend Andrea's if you enjoy fine dining.",1
2337,"This is my go to late night place. With $5.99 Steak and eggs you can't go wrong, plus I like playing poker there and can use my hourly comps to pay for my dinner (which is always a plus).\n\nI have never ordered anything off the menu, some others have and everything looked decent, but with 2 eggs over easy, hashbrowns, white toast and a medium rare steak for $5.99 (from11p-11a), why order anything else.\n\nThe service is usually pretty quick and if you order the special it's usually out pretty fast.\n\nThe first time I had it the steak was a little iffy, but the last few times it has been spot on. The only thing holding this from being 5 stars is the wait for a seat, I know you are busy and I know you want us to go and gamble in the casino, but really 45 mins for a table for 1...you have to be kidding me give me a chair in the corner and I'll be happy",1
2338,"This week we hosted our Annual Sales Meeting at the Hampton Inn on Highland. First off, the staff was amazing. They were the highlight of our stay. From the front desk staff to the event managers, they were always friendly and on top of all of our needs. The space they were able to provide us was great even though we made changes at the last minute to the head count they did everything possible to make our conference room comfortable. The continental breakfast was great - including waffles, bagels, breakfast meats, coffee, and healthy options too. This helped us to cut down on costs for providing breakfast for all our out of town guests. All in all, I would highly recommend the Hampton Inn for a work conference or a family stay. They have great amenities like a heated pool and the staff is incredible.",1
2339,"Read through mixed reviews but decided to give this place a try for a friends birthday not really knowing what to expect. Byob is great, service was attentive and our waiter was really nice about setting the expectation things come as they're ready. Loved the food. About $50 total for two people and we basically split about 7 things on the menu. Left not full but not uncomfortably and had a great time chatting that was complimented by some great flavors and very fresh sushi.",1
2340,"I don't even know where to start with this place. I used to love the Scottsdale location, and when it opened up down in Chandler I was more than excited. The service went way downhill when Steve left. I continued to go as they really do have great food. On average, we would bring in 10-20 people. On a weekly basis most of the time. We'd have going away parties, birthday parties, you name it. \n\nWhen I knew it was getting bad- I went in to pick up lunch for my team at work. They told me I couldn't get a to go order (I'm sorry, what?) per the chef. The server ended up ringing in the order normally so I could get my food. I waited AN HOUR.  If it was even the slightest bit busy, I'd understand. Trust me, it wasn't.\n \nI gave them another chance.  After a friend ordered something that was nothing like she thought it would be the server said she couldn't take it off. We asked to talk to the owner, and the server said, \""""are you sure? She's in a terrible mood\"""". The owner refused to take it off the bill saying \""""this isn't a tasting menu\"""". That $8 roll was that important compared to our $200 tab.  She then proceeded to tell us to \""""f*ck off\"""".\n\nFor some asinine reason, a year later we return to give it another shot. The server was very nice. Towards the end of our stay, we saw the owner loudly talking to another customer, and pointing at us. We became very uncomfortable, so we left. As we were leaving, a host came running out. In a very sarcastic and obnoxious tone said, \""""HAVE A GREAT NIGHT\""""\n\nHow this place is still in business is amazing. This is NOT how you treat paying customers. I know the owner has multiple restaurants around the valley.  SHE alone is destroying such an awesome concept. Don't be in this business if you hate it.",0
2341,"There's no denying that Terry Fator can sing, and its practically tragic that a man with such vocal talent is forced to rely on crappy puppet theater to sell tickets. Unfortunately, crappy puppet theater is really all you get, featuring painfully easy jokes which could only appeal to a crowd too weak to stomach a real comedian, with such unique characters as \""""stereotypical stoner\"""" and stereotypical homosexual.\""""\n\nI was almost willing to forgive the weak comedy, as I truly enjoyed the novelty of seeing Fator croon an incredible range of hits without moving his mouth. Unfortunately, the man completely lost me with his desperate original numbers. Nothing says a \""""night of laughs\"""" like a song about a kid dying of cancer and getting a horse from Jesus. Holy crap did that come out of nowhere.\n\nWatching people give this man a standing ovation was like watching America die.",0

2343,"Well, It has a colorful menu board?!\n\nUnfortunately, that's about all Tacos Jalisco has that appeals to me.  I've eaten there twice and the first time the food wasn't memorable (literally, I don't remember it).  The second time the food was so bland it made me want to cry.  I had the gorditas carnitas.  It was hot, but there was absolutely no flavor...or texture.  It was basically hot Mexican mush, and that describes the beans and the rice too.  \n\nThe staff was friendly, and the place was clean.  I'm not sure if the guy in the corner is selling bootlegged CDs or not, but it seems kinda sketchy to me.\n\nHans really loves this place, but I am not sold.  At all.",0
2344,"I'm giving this 4 stars but I think after they get fully ramped up they'll make 5. \n\nI'm delighted to see a crawfish place in Charlotte, and in the University area even more. The seafood was very fresh and the sauce we had (Crackin' sauce) on it was delicious with chunks of fresh garlic and spicy, gooey goodness that you just have to lick off your fingers again and again. If you have ever had a Cajun boiling pot (similar to a low country boil) and loved it this is for you. If you don't like eating seafood covered in flavorful sauces with your fingers after it was dumped out on the table.. well.. there's always Red Lobster for you to go to. \n\nThey supply bibs, which you can wear if you like, but really a good seafood boil kind of makes you feel like you need a shower afterward - and this definitely fit that description. We had 1 lb. each snow crab (there were no blue or Dungeness available yet, but they are on the menu), crawfish and clams all covered in this wonderfully spicy Crackin' sauce has a nice level of heat, spicy and flavorful without killing your tastebuds. If you like less spice there's the Mellow and if you like more there's the Extremely Crackin'. \n\nI think I will want to try the mellow sauce next, if for no other reason than it is their base sauce and I'd like to see how close it is to the garlic crabs that used to be served at Hole In The Wall Crab Shack, but that will have to wait until they have blue crabs. I'm also looking forward to trying the Korean barbecue, but I have a hard time turning away a good seafood boil so I'm not sure when that will happen.",1
2345,"Madison Sole is largely forgettable on the State St. walk because it only caters to one crowd: women, and it does that only mediocrely at best. The shoes are generally extremely overpriced and not all that cute looking either; though, I did manage to find a pair of flip-flops for a decent amount ($29 down from $99--less than what I found for a decent pair at another place on State St.)\n\nThe service here is mediocre, too. When I went in, the two clerks were busy gossiping over another employee for at least 15 minutes before they realized someone had been in the store. When I got in, they clucked about a pair I was wearing and how \""""comfortable\"""" it was.\n\nI got it home and the large blister on my feet from the strap is a testament otherwise.

2346,"Of the many times I've stayed in Vegas, this continues to be my favorite spot. I love/hate that it's so far from the strip, but really enjoy being able to rub elbows with locals and relax far away from the traffic and insanity. \n\nThe rooms are incredible. Clean, excellent amenities, deep bathtub/ nice shower, HBO, wi-fi in resort fee, free shoe shining service, extremely comfy king-size beds with fluffy comforters. \n\nThe resort is also my favorite in Vegas. They have a theatre, a bowling alley, full casino, spa, tons of dining options, a club and a lounge. They're also very close to tons of affordable neighborhood options - BJ's, Albertson's - which we like to pick up drinks at or hit happy hour. \n\nThe pool here is beautiful. I love the hottubbing, but have found the pool to always be too cold to swim in, even in summer. Their poolside bar makes great drinks that come in pineapples, though, and you can chill on one of their poolside Cabana bed thingies. \n\nThe two women I worked with at the front counter this visit (12/30/13 - 1/3/2014) were incredibly nice, helpful, and professional - a huge improvement over my previous visit. If you're looking for a unique Vegas experience, I highly recommend Red Rock. You'll leave feeling refreshed and relaxed, not blown-out and frazzled. Already looking forward to our next visit.:-)",1

I bought a car that pulled to the right, during the purchase I told the salesman that I would not buy the car if it pulls to the right. So he assured me that they would take care of it. After they looked over the car twice the problem was not fixed and the owner said tough shit I am not helping you. The car also has a DTC for a sensor that came on 2 days after I bought the car.

2350,We were here because of Diners Drive Ins and Dives Tv show. My wife and I pulled up to the parking lot and it seemed kind of edgy but we went in and so glad we did. It wasn't very crowded so we sat right down. We were greated by a nice waitress and she gave her recomendations. We went with the Guinea pie which is a white pizza with home made meatballs and ricotta cheese and a garlic sauce. We also tried the suicide fries which had a habenero sauce with three kinds of peppers. Oh my gosh was it hot but addicting. The carnitas tacos were good too. We live in California but i can see us making a spontaneous road trip to eat at this place sometime in the near future.,1
2351,My husband and I tried Bradshaw's on a Saturday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised considering the reviews. We sat at the bar which had a great industrial feel- really our style. The crowd was definitely more men than women but makes sense as it has a sports bar feel. I have no problem with it has I enjoy watching sports. Prices seemed reasonable for beers and good daily specials. I had wings which were pretty good and really enjoyed their fries. My husband had the French dip which was delicious! The only thing was our bartender seemed a little absent but then again she had a large bar to deal with. All in all it was good experience and we can't wait to come check out the live music.,1
2352,The food was excellent! Service was friendly. The restaurant itself has a welcoming aura and the music is not overwhelming and rather soothing. The food came out in a timely fashion but we did go in early around opening time. They take open table reservation on the site. Another plus side is they do substitute white rice for brown rice!;-),1

2354,"Overpriced. If they cut their prices by a 1/3 and gave that money to preserving rain forests, they'd be doing their patrons and the environment a humongous favor. For these prices, I'd go elsewhere. The only reasonably priced items are the salads, sandwiches and burgers hidden on the 2nd from last page--of course. The three of us had the Chinese chicken salad for $13.99 each and sparkling water, soda and ice tea.\n\nThis place has to be family and birthday central. I think I saw enough sparkler candles for me to forgo the 4th of July this year. Then all the animatronic animals do their roar and squawk routine occasionally. They are probably upset they aren't getting a cut of the outrageous prices.\n\nVerdict: Stop global warming and price gouging by avoiding this tourist and bad food trap.",0
2355,"Dear Roka Akor,\n\nI want this to be a love letter but it's not. We had such a short relationship but I feel we have to break up.\n\nI spent $200 at dinner for 3 ozs of fish, one appetizer, and two drinks. And the worst part was it didn't even taste very good. \n\nOur waiter was obsequiously friendly and recommended that if I was a sushi connoisseur I should have the best sushi. Fine, OK, I hear Roka that you are a top 10 sushi restaurant in USA. I have had sushi at some of the others, let's see how you stack up. I am willing to pay for quality.\n\nYour sashimi was of questionably quality, marinated to perdition in order to hide the fishy taste that only emerges when fish begins to rot. The fatty tuna was regular tuna. The portions were tiny! Seriously about 3 ozs of fish for two orders of the chef's choice best sashimi. Some of the flavors of the marinates were quite good, I give you that. But just like spandex does not make the obese look sexy, so vinegar and soy does not make low quality fish sexy. I have eaten fish off the boat at the fish market in Tokyo, not only were you not nearly as good, you weren't even nearly as good as some conveyor belt dining sushi I've had. Don't tell me this is the best you can do!\n\nI must have looked like I had money, or looked too blonde (I'm a brunette btw), because the happy hour menu was never mentioned. Happy hour prices were in effect but the one appetizer I ordered which should have been covered by the happy hour menu was charged at full price. \n\nI couldn't run away from you fast enough. Return? No. Why would I want to return to an abusive relationship?",0

Anyone can find something they like at the store. \n\n  Their furniture is cool and often artisan crafted in some back water countries. Makes it unique and interesting.

How does that work? It takes forever to get a drink and then it's just generally expensive no matter what you get. There's also a back bar that seems to never be in use. With the amount of people that hang out back there for the majority of the night, you'd think they'd hire a few extra people. \n\nAlso? Maybe invest in some misters for your back bar-it gets ridiculously hot back there when it's packed full of people. It's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment.

2366,"No stars... I ordered a pizza from Falbo Bros (N. Sherman Avenue) in Madison last July. The usual-- thick, dense, not good gluten free crust. Very dense. I ordered another one on October 7th. Same deal. I ordered another pizza from them on October 20th and was shocked by the crust-- light, thin, not dense, and it was AMAZING. But, it was too good to be true-- my boyfriend (non celiac) tasted it and said it tasted just like his regular crust.\n\nI emailed the company that night and asked them if they had changed their crust recently. I told them if they had not changed it, that their kitchen had made a very serious mistake and needed to be much more careful in the future. They emailed me back on October 22nd saying they'd changed it and asked if I liked it. Of course I did-- it was amazing.\n\nSo... I ordered another one on October 23. (PS: I am recovering from major surgery so I have been ordering in more than usual.) October 23 was again, a wonderful crust-- and my boyfriend said it tasted just like his. My skin was itchy and I spent a lot of time trying to figure out where the gluten poison had come from but figured they had no reason to lie in the email and certainly, they would not have made the same mistake twice.\n\nWe had a coupon so last week, I ordered TWO gluten free pizzas. Amazing, wonderful pizzas. And I ate them both. And, my skin was itchy, my skin developed deep infections, and I really started to wonder where on earth I was getting into such horrible gluten ingestion. And as with any celiac, I got tired because I was unable to absorb my nutrition properly.\n\nI really didn't believe the pizza thing... so I set out to order some gluten free home test kits. In the mean time, we ordered pizza Monday night for the Packer game... and what should they deliver but their old, usual, dense crust gluten free crust that tasted horrible.\n\nI wrote them a scathing email-- that they lied about a recent crust change (they had the same crust in July), that they did not ask their kitchen to be more careful, that they charged me extra for gluten free, and that their careless and negligent attitude could seriously sicken someone with severe celiac (though, no celiac would order a gluten free pizza from a gluten kitchen, I am sure.)\n\nNo email back after I called them out on it.  Email copies available upon request.  Will do no future business with them after their careless attitude about gluten allergy.",1
2367,"THE BEST YOGA STUDIO IN PHOENIX, HANDS DOWN!\n\nWhy?\n1. Quality Teachers\n2. Dedication to authentic yoga\n3. Supportive community environment\n4. Variety of styles\n5. Yoga teacher training/advanced studies program\n\nI've been doing yoga for more than 15 years, and have tried many studios in the valley. Yoga Pura, by far, is the best studio in town for an authentic experience of yoga.\n\nI particularly enjoy Eric's classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. There is a certain focus and concentration, as well as a the overall feeling of peace I experience during his classes that I just can't get anywhere else. He teaches yoga as a discipline for creating peace and happiness in his students' lives...not just fluffy stretching.\n\nSome of my other favorite classes include Nyla's Level 1 & 2 and essentials,  Rachel's essentials class, and for a good restoration class, check out Laura. I also absolutely LOVE the Yoga Nidra (guided meditation) offered here. Nidra is really hard to find in town, and YP is one of the few places that actually trains teachers in the practice of Nidra. \n\nRegardless of what your looking for...hatha, flow, power, gentle, restorative, meditation...whether you are new or an experienced practitioner, you will find something here that suits your practice style. My best advice to you is to try different teachers and different classes. \n\nOnce you start coming here, you may never stop! If you come regularly, you will undoubtedly make friends. It's so nice to come to class and see people I've met over the years. The community at YP is definitely one of the things that makes it so special.\n\nLastly, yet most importantly.... \n\nYoga is about realizing your limitless potential and releasing from the suffering of the mind. It does this by bringing you into alignment with your \""""true self\"""" and freeing your mind from the lies it tells itself. I always knew that yoga made me feel better. But it wasn't until I started practicing with Eric at Yoga Pura that i started to understand why. This lead me to take YP's Yoga Teacher Training and Advanced Studies program in 2011. It was by far THE BEST thing I have done to improve my life. And for that, I will be eternally grateful to Eric, YP teachers and the YP community.\n\nBut don't take my word for it...Test it out for yourself. They offer 3 free classes for newcomers. ENJOY!",1
2368,"I love the concept of this restaurant and I was really excited to try it, the decor is cool and fun and the menu is interesting.  The service was friendly.  Kudos to someone who has a great idea and nuts up and goes through with it so I was glad to give them my business. \n\nThe two sandwiches I have had weren't all that great though, in a word greasy.  Now I love grilled cheeses and I have made some good ones myself and I load them up with butter and they get toasty, buttery, crispy, and gooey (AKA delicious).  Here it fell short and was limp and greasy.  The bread was barely toasted and I don't think they use butter but some type of oil instead.  The saut\u00e9ed mushrooms on one were grey and not brown and caramelized like they should be and they were also greasy too.  The cheese was barely melted so the sandwich wasn't held together by the melted cheese, a lot of the filling slipped out.  The salami I had in another sandwich was real low quality but worked out ok because it was soft and easy to bite.  \n\nIt really reminded me of the quality of some greasy diner and I had hopes for something more from the self proclaimed gourmet grilled cheese place.    \n\nIt is so true, with a simple thing like a grilled cheese the most important component is the execution and that was the biggest downfall.",0
2369,"Decor is quaint.  We had a bad experience here though.  As we where being seated, we passed 5 open booths.  hostess sat us down at a wobbly table, so we asked to move to a booth.  she pointed at a row of 4 occupied booths, told us to sit here and wait for one of them to open up.

2370,"They just broke into my house without any notice to show around. They knocked so violently I almost mistaked it for gunfire. Then, before I was able to say anything, they broke in. There was at most 2 seconds interval between the knock and the break in. I wasn't dressed, and the guy just said \""""Oh hi, we're showing the apartment\"""", and stormed into my kitchen. Ridiculous. I started ranting as soon as they left the room. This is totally invasive and disrespectful. I didn't read their lease very carefully when I moved in and I totally regret it (they shoved it to me and told me everything must be signed by the end of the day, so I thought whatever, how bad could it be?). Apparently, breaking into the house without any notice is written into the lease here, and if you don't comply, they'll fine you as much as your unit's monthly rent (around $1000 for telling them no you can't enter the house). I've heard of several cases like this. They're unbelievably hostile and try to juice as much out of your pocket as possible.",0
2371,"BANG BANG BANG on our door at 4 am by the front desk clerk!!!  Why? Ok, let's start at the beginning.  Phoenix has an overabundance of budget adequate chain motel/hotel rooms, and we figured this was one of them.  When we arrived the day before Thanksgiving, 2011, we found a full-on construction site, so much so that we could NOT find the way INTO the hotel.  Eventually a workman snaked our way though to an incomplete lobby and we went up to our room.  AT FIRST LOOK, this newly redecorated room looked and smelled clean, and even had a somewhat upscale interior design for a budget motel. (This Ramada is becoming a Holiday Inn we were told).  But it was downhill after that.  The water was turned off and we did not have water until three hours after we arrived.  We turned on the air conditioner because it was in the 80's and the window does not open. WELL, we might as well have been in an airplane test hangar because it is SO unrelentingly LOUD that you cannot hear the TV...at all...and I have great hearing.  We eventually realized that the Air Conditioner / Heat Pump individual unit, while there IS a wall thermostat, only has ONE setting and...it is HIGH. (Lo and Med still blast at HIGH intensity).  Little by little, the fault became apparent to us...this was a cosmetic touchup, but the important things were missing like....a BATH TUB...there is no tub, just a shower with a shower head that barely yields a dribble of water....the TV is an old TUBE TV and it is blurry and scrambled and two calls to the desk (no one answers the extensions) brought no results.  Speaking of the bathroom, there is no window, no fan, and an ill-fitting toilet seat that shifts loudly to one side each time you \""""alight\"""".  Many have complained about their odd shoji pocket door to the bathroom which bounces back open, and clipped my husband's hand twice. As others have mentioned, there are paperthin walls APPARENTLY, because we woke up at 4 am to watch the news.  We are very conscious as we live in a condo to keep our TV down.  Nonetheless, with this HORRENDOUSLY loud wall unit air conditioner, if you want to hear the TV, you have to turn it up and we did NOT turn it up as much as we would like to, but....BANG BANG BANG on our door a few minutes after we had gotten up.   The Front Desk Clerk rudely said when I opened the door (which is freaky at 4 am) -\""""The neighbors complained about the noise and I could hear it all the way down the hall\"""" - **Note to Manager: GOOD LUCK RAMADA/HOLIDAY INN when it is 110 degrees outside and people have their TV's up much louder than we did to combat the a/c on UNRELENTING HIGH.  Trust me, there will be multiple complaints every night.  Other reviews of this motel have mentioned the same complaints.  I was planning on telling the desk clerk when we checked out after 3 nights about some of these \""""constructive ideas\"""" for their own benefit.  However, the checkout clerk looked like he was NOT open to  input (probably overdosed on complaints), so I refrained.  Basically, the owners have cheaped out on this major remodel..  If you read this, Ramada/Holiday Inn Manager, at the very least you need to get an electrician to REWIRE the thermostat to get a  LOW FAN setting on the a/c wall unit, buy new TVs, replace the toilet seat, change out the bathroom shoji door and shoot some insulation into the walls.  And, we're just not all that picky!",0
2372,"Okay, this is hard for me, but the service this time was bad enough to warrant this. I have always been a fan of Big Wa. I have been eating here for five years, perhaps a bit longer. Today may keep me from going back. The food was great, always is, service was TERRIBLE. The server rushed us out as if our business was not important. Before we were done eating he literally came to our table and said \""""Okay\"""" and picked up our plates. To be fair, mine was empty, but my fiance and my 2 year old \ndaughters were not. That is totally unacceptable, and it is not like we were there for an extended period of time (around 20 minutes). To take my 2 year olds lunch without asking when we are spending $25 at your establishment is not acceptable.",0
2373,"This dog park is AWESOME. I use to take my gentle giant, Spartacus, to the Steele Indian School Park, but it wasn't very well lit and it was divided by big dogs and small dogs and he never really felt at home in the big dogs section.\n\nI LOVE Chaparral Dog Park because Spartacus can go in the \""""Passive Dogs\"""" area and he isn't mobbed at the gate by over-active dogs. He can take his time watching the other dogs and get a feel for the dynamic of the group before he starts to play. My guy is pretty shy at first, so this is really importanht for him.\n\nAll of the pet parents are SO friendly and will come up and talk to you about your dog all the time. There are a lot of regulars here that I am getting to know as I have been going 2-3 times a week to get Spartacus' energy out.\n\nThis park is extremely well lit, which is great for me because I'm usually there in the evenings after it's already getting dark. It's also huge so you never feel like you're too crowded.\n\nMy only tip is that if you have a dog that's new to dog parks / not use to socializing, don't go on a weekend - go on an off hour when it's not as crowded to see how they do.\n\nThe only tips I can offer is if you're going into the passive dog area, don't let your dog hump/try-to-dominate other dogs, keep an eye on your dog, clean up after your pooch, and always close the gate and make sure other dogs aren't in the gated area when you're coming and going. Last week someone left a gate open and a little dog darted out into traffic and was killed by a car.:( PLEASE, leave the gates closed for all of us!",1
2374,"I wish I had checked with yelp earlier before I went.\nI arrived with two other people and we sat down for 10 minutes before we even received water.  Service was extremely slow and other individuals received their food before us.  We ordered shakes, finished those, and waited another 10-15 minutes before our food arrived.  The appetizer was less than what we had hoped for, for the price we paid.   The server did not give us an option as to how our burger could be cooked and arrived over done and two of the three orders were inaccurate.  The bill was over $75 and we will not be heading back.",0

2376,"Staying at The Quad has been hands down the most horrible travel experiences of my lifetime. When we first got there, around 11pm, we stood in line for 45 minutes waiting to be checked in. After that we got lost in a labyrinth of hallways and elevators, we finally found the elevator to our floor that was basically in the basement. The elevator smelled like cat urine and dirty diapers, our floor smelled even worse. When we opened the door to our room we noticed lewd drawings on the walls, cockroaches, stains everywhere. It basically looked and smelled like a hooker had been murdered there, recently. We obviously immediately decided that we could not stay there, so we called the front desk. I was on hold for 30 minutes until we decided to walk back up to the front desk and talk to someone in person. The lady seemed unfazed at our assessment of the room and told us that floor hadn't been renovated in twelve years. We got \""""upgraded\"""" to a different room that still smelled and had stains, but it was an improvement. I had brought pool cues with me, because I was there for the 2013 APA Nationals. The next night we fell asleep (we were sober), and upon waking up realized that my pool cues, and another girl's luggage, were gone. Which means that someone came into our room while we were sleeping and stole them. We called hotel security to file a report and he also seemed unfazed at this occurrence. \""""This happens all the time,\"""" he told me. He also said \""""The casino only cares about one thing -the casino,\"""" and \""""chalk it up as a loss.\"""" We noticed the front door to our room did not latch properly unless you slammed it shut, apparently it is not uncommon for thieves to roam the hallways and push on doors and steal from the ones ajar. They did not have cameras in the hallways, and were unwilling to look at footage from the video they did have. When no one seemed willing to help me in any way, I spoke with a manager. I did get a little emotional during our conversation, because there was some creep in our room while three helpless young women slept. We could have been raped or murdered, he could of done whatever he wanted, and no one at The Quad seemed to care. I told the manager I was not staying in an unsafe room and we were once again moved but he still would not do anything about our stolen belongings. After that my vacation was basically ruined, as one can imagine. To anyone reading this, I beg you not to stay at The Quad. It is unsafe, the staff is unhelpful and \""""doesn't care about you\"""" - direct quote from staff member. I will be calling a lawyer and I plan on suing. I am also calling every media outlet in LV so that everyone is aware of how scary and unsafe this place is. The building needs to be condemned, not renovated.",0
2377,"I came here to get stronger due to being rear ended in a car accident.  I was having issues with back pain, but I wanted to strengthen as well as feel good.  You go through an initial how to work the machines and how to adjust for your sensitive areas first, before you can even sign up for classes.  A little intimidating at first, but most helpful.  You'll want to go through a few classes to find your right instructor(s) that best fit your needs and push you in the right way.  For any of them, don't be afraid to ask for help to make sure you feel it or if it's uncomfortable.  My favorites are Ashly and Erin.  I also really like the stretch classes on Wednesday.  Pricing is very reasonable and the booking site also has a mobile app, very convenient if you need to make changes or add classes while you are thinking about it.",1

The team from Pretty in Pink made everything sparkle and shine. They were thorough and efficient.  \n\nOn the third session, I wanted to see how they would do with a typical cleaning.

Between the heat and the need for a GPS to navigate this place, most people must go to one or two stores they know they need to go to, then pack it up and head out.\n\nNow, they did have misters here and there, but the ones that did work did not do much as they were 10' off the ground and the water evaporated too high off the ground.

However, when we walked up to the host and said, \""""We have reservations for 5:30,\"""" and he said, \""""Tonight? Oh, we don't have anything available,\"""" when we were the ONLY people there, didn't start off well at all. When I reiterated, \""""We have reservations...McCormack at 5:30. On Open Table....\"""" he was like, \""""Oh! Well, we aren't ready. Please sit at the bar first. Have something on me.\"""" Huh. Okay.\n\nSo we sat at the bar. The bartender was definitely frazzled...looked like she was still cleaning up from the brunch shift. Okay. No problem. I asked if she could make an extra dirty martini. She looked at me and said, \""""I'll have to go downstairs for olive juice.\"""" Um...okay? Again, I realize it's Christmas, so I say, \""""No. I don't want to bother you. I'll just take a whiskey on the rocks. What do you have?\"""" She named several I'd never heard of but offered the bottle of one to sniff. Okay. We'll take two. Ridiculously smooth...Dullamore? (Not Tullamore...we know that one.) Anyhow...it was nice and then two other groups got seated while we still sat at the bar waiting. Huh. Well, I know it's a slower pace here so we were patient and finished our whiskey and then a different host sat us. \n\nDinner tonight was a $50 prix fixe. Seemed decent to us. We selected appetizers and dinners. I had the foie gras...something I had heard Montreal was well known for. Ugh. It tasted like strong liverwurst. That was my fault. I should never have ordered it not sure if I'd like it. My husband had a salmon appetizer that he said was \""""fishy and chewy\"""". Neither of us finished our appetizers, but again...probably our fault.\n\nSalads came out...they were tiny little piles of grassy leaves with one slice of an orange, four cranberries, and a dollop of vinegar. Meh.\n\nMy husband had boeuf bourguignon..but with medallions of beef as well as pork...quite good. However, the beef had several, rather tough, chewy portions...sinewy...something one wouldn't expect from a restaurant like this. I had a risotto that was more like a bouillabaisse. It was good, but definitely needed some salt. \n\nDessert was a molten chocolate cake...that came out like two little bear turds....no lie. And they tasted about as wonderful (or at least I think bear turds probably taste like this). They were flavorless, unsweetened globs of chocolate that I took one bite of and left. I NEVER leave chocolate. EVER. \n\nOkay....ALL of this could be tolerated because it was Christmas...no one wants to work on Christmas. I get it. The death knell came when I asked the waitress for our check. She asked, \""""All on one?\"""" -____- Are you kidding me? We are a couple out for dinner on Christmas. Do you think this is a blind date?? Do you think that, because I'm older than my husband, we're going Dutch??? I became severely annoyed at this...but my husband said the girl was young, she doesn't know. We look at the bill. Our whiskeys \""""on me\"""" (the host) were on our bill at $15 each. Really?? Okay. I calm down. I get it. Probably not your best servers on tonight. We pay and go to get our coats from the coat check. No one has time to look at us.

I then put my scarf and gloves on and went to the coat rack and retrieved our coats myself. We walked out with no one batting an eye. \n\nHonestly? The food was okay. Not worth the $50, though. I enjoyed my entire night, even with the lackluster food, until the unwitting comment from the young server. I'm sorry, but for the price and snootiness of the place, they need to train their help better. I'd skip this and try one of the many, MANY other places right around the area for dinner.

2393,"After a major screw up by me, booking the room for the 22nd and driving up to Vegas on the 21st, it was not until I hit state line when The Jennifer mentioned today is the \""""21st\"""" until it dawned on me that we have no room and no place to stay unless I want to us to shack up with my buddy and his new found girlfriend. Not likely...I called the front desk and explained to them what had happened and they said they can't switch my date. I used my salesman skills and talked my way into the switch with terms like: I know you can really use my business, look at my account, look at my points, I have always had a great experience here, etc, etc, and walla! I got us the room but had to pay the difference; fair enough. When we checked in, we even got a corner room with dual windows!! \nOnly problem during our trip was when housekeeping took the floor mat in the bathroom, leaving the bathroom with no floor mat so when you come out of the shower; water is everywhere. So we called housekeeping and they did manage to bring one up - half hour later. It was a small issue, the room was clean and nice. It rained so we can't use the pool since they closed it because of thunderstorm. TI is always a good value and is close to everything. \nTIPS: \nIf you stay at the Hotel, you get VIP standing for the Sirens show if you want to see some of the hot chics in Fish Nets bellow out some cheesy pirate lyrics. \nAlso, the Video Black Jack and Video Roulette does not give points on the gaming card...WTF is up with that??",0
2394,"I can't seem to understand 'why' many people rate this as a first-class sports bar because in actuality, its one of the worst I've ever been in, and I grew up going to the sports books in Juarez, Mexico where their idea of a flat screen was a gabacho thumping the TV onto the sticky tile floor and looking cross at an hombre could get your eye cut out and fed to you as the special of the day.\n\nYes, Majerle's is worse.  \n\nOkay, well, no one in Thunder Dan's is gonna devour your soul, but the place makes me feel like I'm sharing a pint with Florentines Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi and Ciappo Ubriachi in Dante's inner ring of the seventh circle of Hell.\n\nThe set up is terrible.  The TVs are difficult to see from EVERYWHERE in the bar and they have it arranged so that if you are fortunate enough to view up to TWO SCREENS (!) at one time, they are both showing the same game.  This is a problem during major events like the NCAA tournament or bowl games.  \n\nMoreover, i would be kitten-hearted to ask a manager to change their programming to another game i'd rather watch.  \n\nThe bar is always crowded, which makes it even more wondrous for me when i actually go in there and wait for a seat just to encounter no beer specials and terrible food.\n\nI wonder how large the bowl of crack the editors at Sports Illustrated were smoking to rate this anywhere near the top 1,000 sports bars in the US.",0
2395,"Hate to be the bad review guy, but here goes. Dressed to the nines, the wife and I step out to dinner at this joint. We've been dining out in Vegas for over 20 years and this is a first. Upon being seated I am asked to remove my hat as they have a no-hat policy. I think to myself, must be fancy, as I remove my hat and begin to enjoy a great dinner. Food and service was very nice. As I am enjoying this succulent filet mignon, I notice that most other guests in this place are dressed for an outing to Wal-Mart.\nShorts, dirty tee shirts from 80's rock concerts, etc.. I ask the waiter why they are offended by people wearing hats. His answer was very polite as one would expect. Hate to ramble here, just make sure you don't wear a hat around these folks and you'll have a great time.",1
2396,"Largest kosher selection Ive ever seen! Its Jewish heaven!\n\nThis Smith's offers products other Smith's do not offer such as fresh fruit packaged at their deli, and Jewish stuff you may need, as well as Himalayan pink salt, and others.\n\nIts your typical Smith's store layout, the customer service here is spotty though. The self check out has this one lady who is an old hag, but whatevs.\n\nThe store is very clean and used to have a Golden Spoon, but they have since cleared it out. The store itself is not all crazy busy, but always clean. What I would def do is be careful with the juice case in the back by the veggies bc it is sometimes warm and also the cheese area. I like the deli here, its big and spacious and always has enough workers. Get a Smith's card so you can have mucho savings!",1
2397,"I work around the corner from Uncle Sal's and was introduced to this gem by my boss. Since that fateful first encounter, I have been enjoying lunch here every other month or so for over three years. The atmosphere is cozy and relaxed. The service in the bar (where I usually eat) is excellent... my cup is never less than half-full and the food comes out within 15-20 minutes of ordering. \n\nWhat I've had here: \n- Grilled Italian Sausage with Green & Red Bell Peppers (only available in the bar) - delicious! This is a lot of food for only $7.95. \n- Chicken Marsala (entree) - one of my favorites! This is a full chicken breast in an abundance of Marsala with loads of tender mushrooms. \n- Chicken Francese (sandwich and entree) - PERFECTION. This is my all time favorite at Uncle Sal's. Chicken breast with a white wine and lemon sauce. \n- Chicken Parmigiana - Tasty. \n- Eggplant Parmigiana (sandwich) - Yummy for those days when I don't want meat. Get this with the sweet potato fries! \n\nI've also had one of their pizzas. Pretty good, but I've never ordered it again because they have so many other things that are better. \n\nI highly recommend Uncle Sal's! \n\nSide Note: To be fair, I took my husband here once and he wasn't blown away. There might be something wrong with him though...:)",1
2398,"I had the Andy's chicken! Crazy huge portion! Amazing presentation! My hubby had the chorizo hash....he said it was ok. He ate half of mine. Had a yummy butterscotch espresso, yum! Oj was fresh and yummy! A Vegas must go to breakfast place! Then go walk 5 miles! Totally worth it though. Service was good. I think I'll venture to the San Diego location with my family this summer! We got there at about 10:15 on a Sunday and got seated right away. When we left the wait was insane!",1
2399,"This place is so much fun! I wish I could remember the name of our server, he was absolutely fantastic! I even forgot my dessert at the table and he chased us out the door to bring it to us! It was very busy but definitely fun to be able to play ping pong while we waited for our table! The only down side is that it is on the pricey side and as good as the food is, I'm not sure it's worth the amount we spent. Will probably go back for drinks and apps!",1
2400,"I was apprehensive about coming here for a Naked and Famous show just because of all the horrible reviews I read on here about it. In all honesty, I think the venue was actually pretty great. We arrived early so we had no issues getting our will call tickets or finding parking ($7). The stage/standing area was clean and well-maintained. Since I arrived early, I was able to stand near the front and be very close to the band. It's an intimate setting and I think as far as a venue for a concert goes, this place exceeded my expectations.",1
2401,"I work in Oakland, so this is my home away from home in the morning! I love this particular Crazy Mocha for so many reasons: the location, the morning barista, and let's not forget the coffee and tea! I also love that they have partnered with LoyalTree, a rewards program for those with smartphones. The only drink I've had that I didn't like was the chai latte. It tasted like how a spiced candle smells! Other than that, every latte I've had has been excellent! With very little seating, this location can get a little crazy in the afternoon, but it's always quiet and cozy in the morning.",1
2402,"Everything the last woman said is 100% true but, Clarence Vastine MD works for Megan and he is awesome. I HATE Dr.'s with a passion, but he is an informative and knowledgeable Dr. The staff is horrible but once you get past them Dr. Vastine is great. I have been to dozens of Dr.'s in the past 2 years and 90% of the ones I've been to have HORRIBLE staff, so you just have to find a good Dr. you like. Dr. Vastine comes highly recommended by me!",1
2403,"It's a pizza joint.  Don't come for the decor.  But do come for the pizza.  Probably the closest thing to NY pizza in Vegas.  It's not gourmet, but it's consistently good.  I like the pizza better than Dom Demarco's (which is sometimes great and sometimes bad), but the ambiance is bad.  \n\nThis isn't a date place, but it's great for a quick slice or for take-out.",1
2404,"My wife & I went on a recommendation from a friend. We arrived a little after noon on Sunday, 8-26. We were seated promptly as there was one table open. I'll give the pros & cons.\nPros, we were seated promptly & Maggie, our server was very good.\nThat's about it for the pros.\nNow the cons...\nIf you order a beef dip, that on the menu says it comes with swiss, you'd expect swiss, right? Well, they must have found a source for invisible swiss, as they wasn't any on the sandwich. The beef was way overcooked & very dark, the roll was hard & crusty, it softened up a little after i dunked it in the au jus. The fries must have been in the rinse cycle for a bout 20 minutes. Soggy & limp & had no taste. My soda was good.\nMy wife ordered the California Omlette. She was not impressed. Her potatoes were ok at best & the fried bread was horrible. We thought about sending our food back, but just then, a party of four sent three of their meals back, so there was no way I was going to follow suit. Don't know if the cook was being rushed or he was off & the janitor was making meals, but, the makeover might have done wonders for the inside, but they sure need lessons in cooking.\nNever again.",0
2405,"I can't recommend this shop highly enough. On a Thanksgiving road trip my friend made a stop in Phoenix and his water pump went out when he got here. I checked Yelp to find him a mechanic and had him call Honest-1. After he talked to the owner, Tom, he said he felt confident that he'd be able to fix it so there was no need to call another shop. \n\nWe dropped the vehicle off at Honest-1 at 1:30 (on the day before Thanksgiving!), and Tom assured us that the work would be done that day which was critical since my friend was leaving Phoenix on Friday morning. We came back at 4:30 and the car was fixed and waiting for us. A lot of auto shops would have added a charge to the bill for doing the work within such a short window of time but that wasn't the case with Honest-1. On top of that we were given a discount for telling him we found him on Yelp. They also participate in a program with other shops that guarantees the work no matter where you are in the country. \n\nThe lobby is spotlessly clean, has a comfortable waiting area, TV, coffee, and a computer for customer use. Definitely five stars all the way around.",1
2406,"Wannaburger is definitely the only go-to for a fast food American style burger joint. It's cheap, good and a delicious eat. They have a pretty extensive menu, although still not too crazy, with the option for a hamburger or cheeseburger with one or more patties. They have a range of free toppings like jalapenos, grilled onions and Cajun spices or for an extra.50 p you can get blue cheese, bacon, etc. \n\nFor around \u00a37 you can get a burger, fries and a shake as part of a meal deal and the shakes are definitely worth the add on! I had the black and white, which is half vanilla and half chocolate and it was so tasty, with a great thickness and tiny chocolate bits. \n\nThe staff was lovely, the service was fast and the food was tasty. It's great for what you get, and for the American's who know In & Out, this is a very great stop.",1
2407,Drove from queen creek to meet out of town friends here. This place was recommended to them by a local hotel.  After a 35 minute drive we waited 40 minutes for 6 wings to come out. After another 10 minutes we got another 6 wings.  After another 15 minutes we waited and finally got one of our 2 pizzas. Our order was finally complete to our table after an hour. The wings were just ok. We liked that they offered different flavors.  The pizza was horrible. It tasted like a soggy tontinos pizza. Good priced. Great service. The people were very respectful and friendly.,0
2408,"After hearing so much about this restaurant, we left here terribly disappointed. Gyros were cold and tasteless, the salad with the gyro platter was watered down and soggy, and the service was uncoordinated and sporadic. \n\nDessert was the best part of this meal, and that isn't saying much. Probably will not return.",0
2409,"What a pleasant and enjoyable experience!\n\nWhoever is doing the hiring/training for this branch deserves some serious praise as I continue to read excellent reviews on their service. \n\nI stopped by after a long hike at Tom's Thumb, and it was my first time here. Had a very pleasant conversation with the worker there and after she found out it was my first time there, she hooked me up with 9 extra stamps for their drink card...that is AWESOME. \n\nThe iced coffee definitely rejuvenated me and gave me a great start to a productive day. They also made the drink so fast I didn't even have time to type in my next destination on the gps...amazing!",1
2410,"WOW! Everything we ordered was so fresh and awesome. We wil return here again. We ate here before seeing Le Reve'. AS the show was wonderful, so was  Red 8.\n\nService was so exceptional. It is one of the best Asian we have eaten, in Las Vegas.",1
2411,"My daughter introduced me to her favorite pizza place last night.  Many thanks!  We ordered by phone and it was ready for pickup when promised.  The toppings were exactly as we requested and the folks there were cheerful and friendly.  When we got it home and dug in, it was everything she told me it would be.  Very fresh and tasty and NOT smothered in garlic.  Some places seem to think it's ok to let garlic overpower all the other ingredients, but not Russo's.  Thanks for the great pizza!  I'll be back for more.",1
2412,"Wow, just wow. I had the Rodizio All-You-Can-Eat Experience and I can say that my dining experience was ruined. \n\nFirst off, most of the meats were bland and dry. Now I  finally understand why Gordon Ramsay would take a bite out of a terrible meal and not really eat anymore after that.  He was not being a jerk like some people make him out to be. I too, would be upset if I was fed an injustice done to food. I would rather starve instead of continuing eating terrible food. I just lost my appetite. It was like a punch to the face and I dislocated my jaw. I couldn't stand chewing through their meats. All the meats were basically bunched up in the same spot and seems as if it was cooked on a timer. No attention or care for the meats at all. It does not make sense to me that different meats would be cooked in the same way.\n\nI would say the service is between terrible to mediocre. What confused me during my dining experience though is that one of the servers denied my group a slice of meat because it seems that these servers are assigned tables and that table only. I just wanted my meat! Not only that, but the wait between getting the meats were long. If the meat were decent enough, then I would be staring at an empty plate most of the time. Of course, this wasn't the case since I just couldn't stomach most of the meats after a bite so I just left it to sit on my plate. I feel bad for wasting meat, but it was just that bad.\n\nI had mostly the flank steak and there was no consistency. The first few cuts were medium rare and then towards the end it was extremely rare. The only consistency though was the dryness of the meat. It was so dry that there were no signs of blood anywhere even though the piece was extremely rare. What kind of technique would you have to use to be able to obtain this result? I also had the pineapple, which I was hoping to be a saving grace to add some flavor to the meats, but it was too sweet for my palate and the charred parts tasted like burned marshmallows.\n\nIn terms of the Bazilian experience, it was so so. They start you off with pao de quijo and chips. The pao de quijo was absolutely wrong. it was more like a piece of bread if anything. Next was the rice, beans, and sweet plantain, then the salad. I didn't really go for the appetizers since I wanted the meat experience, but my companion did say he enjoyed the beans.\n\nOverall, I spent almost $60 for the meal, tax, and tip (even with a discount!) and I felt I did not get the experience that I paid for. I do not recommend Samba at all, especially if you are a meat eater. I would not even come back even if they managed to improve on the food and service.",0
2413,"You've got to be kidding?!? If you want hot shoes at discount prices, go to a Marshalls with a shoe superstore or ebay. These shoes are cheap, but expensive if you know what I mean. I guess if you're barefoot and need something to put on your feet or if you're looking for sparkly or spiked hooker pumps, Off Broadway will do, but really? 4 stars??? Maybe the guy shoe section is better. Won't be back to find out. BTW, staff are super nice.",0
2414,"I hate to be that guy that brings down a rating because of a terrible experience. Believe me, I'm not here to troll. I'm so dissatisfied with this place that I don't even want to write an extensive review.\n\nAfter waiting 30 minutes for a haircut, with nobody ahead of me besides the three guys that were mid-cut when I came in, and my barber asked me what kind of cut I wanted. I have a little bit longer hair and wasn't interested in any sort of buzz, and we both verbally agreed I was there for a scissor cut. I was in the chair, hat and glasses off, and the barber basically told me to go ahead and wait for a different barber to take care of it instead. \n\nLong story short, the guy who came in 15 minutes after me ended up getting his haircut while I walked out with no intentions of looking back.\n\nIf you want a good cut, I recommend Electric Haven Tattoo / Barber on McClintock and Southern. They all do scissor cuts.",0
2415,"I give it 4 1/2 close to 5 stars. First time staying here. Chose it because of the price, the fact it had a fridge, the room looked spacious and it said it was close to Old Town. Was not disappointed! Rooms are so spacious, beds comfy, it was nice having a couch, hotel is well kept, lobby was nice, staff friendly, continental breakfast was good. Only one downfall but not worth not staying here again or recommending to family/friends is how small the bathroom (shower/toilet only) is plus poor lighting. Old Town is literally 2 blocks up which is perfect because there're cute shops everywhere.",1

That might be my favorite part... lol My order is always correct and they don't douse the sandwich with too much oil and vinegar, either... Great job with condiment application...\n\nI like this store, but I only head to this location sometimes since it's not always on the way to anywhere I'm headed, if I'm out and about...",1
2417,"this place is fabulous.  my husband and i were in town visiting my parents and the four of us went for dinner to celebrate my b-day.  we could only get a reservation on the patio, which made us nervous, dealing w/ the AZ heat and/or winds of that weekend.  but, the patio was great.  it's a cozy area w/ a fireplace and screens on all sides to block the sun.  it's about as nice a patio as you can get.  \n\nwe all four ordered from the regular menu and were thrilled with our selections and portion sizes.  we ordered these starters:  figs and chevre, lobster ravioli, tomatoes and baby octopus and spring vegetable soup.  the only one that was lacking was the tomato and baby octopus dish, which only had about 2 pieces of octopus.  the other three were fantastic - beautiful presentation all around and i've never eaten a better bowl of vegetable soup.  seriously, i can't say enough about how delicious that soup was.  \n\nfor entrees, we ordered:  lamb, filet mignon, two-wash chicken.  all were delicious, and, again, beautifully presented.\n\nthis meal was about much more than the food we ordered, though.  throughout the dining experience, they bring out many little \""""bites\"""" or \""""amuse bouches.\""""  each one is beautiful, delicious and inventive.  i've always been a bit put off by the whole \""""molecular gastronomy\"""" fad, but binkley's does it just right.  they incorporate highly creative and inventive touches throughout your dining experience.  it's inventive and unusual enough to create a new and exciting experience for diners, but without just being plain weird.  for example, one of the amuses was a mango packet, that they had created with mango pulp, which had been frozen then coated w/ something to create a \""""skin\"""" so it exploded in your mouth.  it was presented in a porcelain soup spoon with something around it (i can't remember... fruit juice perhaps?), so it looked just like a fresh raw egg.  it was really amazing to look at and then experience the flavors and the \""""pop\"""" as you ate it.  these touches throughout dinner make the experience fun and new.\n\nthe staff is top notch.  everyone knows everything about each dish - from bussers to servers.  and, there are MANY details to learn.  clearly, the staff is very well educated on what is on the menu.  it shows and makes a difference for diners.\n\ncan't wait to go to binkley's again!  what an amazing all-around experience.",1

2420,"So disappointed. I have eaten Grimaldi's a few times and it has been amazing. I just usually avoid it because I feel it is too expensive. So today (New years) my favorite pizza place was closed so I decided to call Grimaldi's since it is only a mile away from my house. The pizza was done quite fast, however, it look completely disgusting. The cheese looked like it was like wannabe feta. Idk what was going on. The pizza literally was tasteless and I wasn't going to smother it with Parmesan cheese and crushes red peppers for taste. I most likely will not come back. Shame shame shame.",0
2421,"So surprised this place isn't that great. The restaurant is beautiful, the staff were friendly without being in your face, the waiter even comped our dessert because they were out of strawberries. Their outdoor patio is awesome and I can totally see this being a great place to hang. \n\nOnly problem? Food. Their in house ground burgers have a weird consistency and seemed like they were ground remnants. Their bangers and mash had tasty sausage, but bland potatoes. Worst of all, the creme brule was served ice cold and with a burned top. \n\nIt would take a food overhaul to bring me back. \n\nIn short, there's a reason it's empty in there.",0

I had heard about the Sugar Bowl from some locals and it was only a block away - I thought why not? \n\nIt is definitely retro.And pink. Very pink. Way too pink.  The only thing missing is the hair nets.  I don't think they have remodeled since opening 58 years ago and, according to DH, they haven't cleaned the men's room during that time either;)\n\nWe didn't do dessert and maybe we should have because lunch was not anything to write back home about.  They advertised corn chowder as the soup of the day - and I was so ready for a good bowl of soup. It just wasn't happening. It was - and I am ready to bet the bank on this - a can of creamed-style corn with some diced boiled potatoes and a few sprinkles of bacon. That was it. Corn chowder? Not even close. No white sauce. No cream base. Nothing. A can of cream-style corn.\n\nNow, I am the first to admit - you can make a good quick chowder out of that can - but you need to do a little white sauce, a little butter, some seasonings. Just dumping it - no, that is not acceptable.\n\nAnd not even hot -\n\nAt $4.50 a bowl, you got less than a cup of soup as measured in any other restaurant. It was in a shallow tiny bowl, almost monkey dish size.\n\nDH order the turkey sandwich. Meh. It was turkey and bread and lettuce and mayo. No tomato.  Served with chips. Not worth the $8 price tag for sure.\n\nI ordered a side of their nut bread with cream cheese. It was okay. Not bad, not great, Ok.\n\nFor $18+ for a sandwich, a Diet, a cup of soup, and nut bread, it was not worth it at all. \n\nAll in all, not worth a lunch trip again - although the place was slowly filling up with locals (mostly older).  Maybe I will try dessert there some time but as far as food goes....these boots will keep on walking....",0

Nice and clean environment, very friendly staff. Tony is the one who fixed my screen. Later to find out that I also broke the camera on my phone and bent the entire frame! Wow...I was expecting to have to pay way more than I did. I ended up buying a tempered glass screen cover and paid less than I would have to replace just the screen anywhere else.

2425,"Lodging - 4 Stars:\n\nI really enjoyed the historical background of the property and the rooms where each in their own one-story area (I was honestly expecting some high rise thing) and a small patio. Rooms were outfitted very nicely, they were fancy -- but not so outdone that you felt out of place. \n\nWent with a friend and the two sinks in the room were an excellent bonus. Each evening spent sitting outside, enjoying a bit of wine and the warm Arizona air. Beds were exquisite, rooms were quiet and just enough luxury to make you feel pampered without being overwhelmed by staff or extra charges for amenities.\n\nWe got a room close to the pool, and although a bit nippy in the evenings to go swimming -- it was a short shuffle away from the large hot tub which was excellent (except for the drunk couple that decided to turn it into their personal boudoir...)\n\nSpa - 3.5 Stars:\n\nI have mixed feelings about the spa. First issue was when I was trying to make my appointment and the front desk did not seem very knowledgeable about the services they offered (for skin types, etc.) Then, upon arriving we received a tour of the facilities which was not very personable and seemed so rehearsed. (Also, I think I can find the bathroom and the towels, and I also know how to open up a locker....the tour turned into 15 minutes of me not being able to be in the Jacuzzi.)\n\nIt seems that they schedule everyone at the same time for their services...because before I knew it the calm waiting room had turned into a packed holding cell for half the women of Scottsdale. One by one, they called the clients into their services...but it just felt a tad awkward. \n\nMy massage was EXCELLENT. The masseuse was extremely good, probably one of the best I've had and really enjoyed it. I'm not particularly shy, so it's easy for me to relax pretty quickly when getting a massage. Afterwards, had a facial and the Asthetician was also quite good -- my face was glowing for two days afterwards. I REALLY appreciated that she didn't try to sell me on the products she used, which after a relaxing facial -- the last thing I was is you trying to hawk your $50 face cream in a tube the size of lip gloss.",1

2427,"I brought my dog in who was very sick and not doing well.  They ran a few tests and charged me about a thousand dollars to tell me my dog was old and was going into kidney failure.  I am a medical professional, I asked if this could possibly be an infection and they said no the dog was just old and had about a month to live.  I took the dog to my vet first thing monday morning and the first thing she said was the dog had a good chance of having a serious kidney infection and may respond to treatment.  Isn't that what I asked!  After 5 days of antibiotic treatment the dog is brand new and back to normal.  I can't say enough about my vet, she is awesome and thorough.  As for Animal Emergency clinic, they are boobery and nothing more.  A monkey can start and IV and give fluids, I paid HUGE money for medical management of my dog.  I do anesthesia for a living and if I performed this incompetently I would get my ass sued off for sure and I would deserve it.  I guess vets have the luxury of never having to live under that ax, and they also have the luxury of making a whole lot more money than I do evidently by what they charged.  Humans don't even get charged this much for simple IV therapy!  Totally ridiculous, take your dog, cat, parrot whatever to the U of I, they are expensive but your pet will be alive when you leave.  This place is a joke to the highest magnitude!",0
2428,Amazing food! Great friendly people. You feel at home eating amazingly food. It wasn't very crowded so the guy took time to learn my name and check up on me and the meal I ordered. \nI had the spinach ravioli and it was light and delicious and well flavored. I also had the wonderfully garlic garlic knots - to die for. \nCan't wait to come back as try more,1
2429,"Not a good meal - just a nasty pile of ingredients, including way too much spinach and chicken that was basically bad quality. The girls behind counter take the stuff and grill it for like 45 seconds (not even hot) and then dump all the stuff into a plastic container and douse it with a ton of dressing. All of that gets mixed up and dumped into a cold pita and then twisted and ready to eat or in my case - ready for the garbage can. i thought there were good deals at student dining places, but this place is just like a mall food court, no deals in sight.",0

Who knows when this employee actually showed, because we all gave up. It's time to hire responsible employees that show to work on time. You threw off my Monday.",0
2431,"For my first visit to the Penn Avenue fish market I wasn't really that impressed but I guess since I only had Asiago Bisque, PAFC Salad, and an Avocado roll I don't really have much to go off of. \n\nStaff: They don't really smile and if they are it seems as though their talking amongst themselves. the counter girl is pretty blah zay as well. No personality at all shes more of a \""""tell me what you want so I can go do something else\"""" \n\nFood: I ordered the Asiago Bisque because they had ran out of the soup I wanted. I shouldn't have gotten the soup. The soup I received with a little package of oyster crackers wasn't hot at all and well soup should be served hot not lukewarm or cold. Plus well it had no flavour.

2432,I've gone here twice and been extremely satisfied both times. The first was after I'd tried to go to pink nails first thing in the morning right as they opened and they already had like ten people in there and that was a joke. So on the way home I found this little place tucked away. I walked in and was taken immediately. The techs were chatty and funny. My nails looked flawless for the holiday and they were super quick. I went back today and got a gel mani and pedi. I had them remove my acrylics which I'm always hesitant to do and they actually took the time to soak the acrylics off instead of ripping them off like the last few places I've been. Again I walked in today and there was no wait. Someone immediately took me to a pedi chair. Lots of magazines and looked clean. This might be my permanent place. Only thing I didn't like was for some reason they like peeled the old gel polish off of my toes instead of nail polish remover. Well have to see if they do it again,1
2433,They nailed it once again. The cake I ordered was a shar-pei and it was done to specific description perfectly. I think they can handle anything. Drive to Anthem is well worth it and not that bad. Staff is so nice too.,1

2436,"Eduard and Nissan are absolutely great guys.  I have been going to V's for four years now and I have always walked away happy with my cut.  Both gentlemen are great at what they do, very personable and I really cannot say enough about how much I look forward to going to V's to get cleaned up.\n\nBoth gentlemen are consistent with their approach: prep, cut, clean up with the straight razor (oh man I love that touch) and then the hot towel wrap followed by a scalp massage.

2437,"I personally will never step foot inside the Belmont Soda Shoppe ever again.  I was born and raise in Belmont and was a fan of the original Belmont Drug Store.  A couple of Saturdays ago I was out for a run and towards the end of the run I stopped by the soda shoppe and asked for a small cup of tap water.  It was sunny and 95 degrees outside and I was hot and thirsty.  The guy behind the counter said \""""no she charges for everything\"""".  It wasn't like I was asking for a large scoop of ice cream.  This is Belmont, a small town friendly community.  Obviously these people do not understand that.

I had the fish sandwich and pub fries which was excellent.  The sandwich had 2 huge pieces of breaded fish and a toasted bun with a pitch-perfect sauce.  I took 1/2 the sandwich home as did 2 others.  The pub fries were as expected and delicious.  Others had the meatloaf which was good and grilled cheese did please.  I would go again, maybe have some beer this time.",1
2440,"I should preface this by saying I'm a bit of a hotel snob. Maybe not \""""snob\"""", but due to work I've honestly spent multiple years of my life living in hotels, which is more than most people. I've had great stays at inexpensive places because they keep things clean and care about their guests, and I've had lousy stays at expensive places because they don't do these things. Aria falls somewhere in between.\n\nActually no, Aria falls on the lower end of the spectrum.\n\nThe non-hotel parts are great. The restaurants are nice and overpriced as expected, the casino is lovely, the shops are overpriced as expected, etc. If I didn't actually stay there, I probably would have given it 4 stars.\n\nHowever, the room quality was lousy. First off, there was a big section of peeling wallpaper in the corridor leading to my room. Really? Tape or glue would solve that until it could be properly fixed. I'm shocked that a hotel would allow that to be in the guests' sight, especially when it tries to market itself as luxurious.\n\nThe room itself was \""""meh\"""" at best. The bedside tablet to control the room is such a gimmicky joke, and might have been slightly impressive 12 years ago. It's a slow, laggy system with a lousy user interface, and it's completely asinine to use something such as this for simple functions such as changing the channel on the TV or turning the lights on or off. Unfortunately I was stuck using it to change the TV channels because the remote was dead. Speaking of dead, so was the minibar. It was maybe a few degrees below room temperature at the most. If you're going to use convenience to tempt me with soda, sparkling water, and various alcohols at 500% of retail, they at least need to be nice and cold.\n\nI ordered room service exactly once and the food was absolutely lousy. I would have thought they could manage a decent bowl of ramen (there are world-class ramen houses literally within a few miles of this hotel, so people around here should know what it's supposed to taste like) and it was beyond disappointing.\n\nThe kicker is that my opinions are this low when it didn't cost me a dime. Corporate expense account for the lot of it. Had I been actually paying to stay here, I would have checked out within a couple hours of check-in. I can literally say it's barely worth staying here for free. It seems like if you want to drop the cash for one of their upper level suites you can have a great experience, but after this initial experience I'm not going to give them the chance when I come back for pleasure instead of business.\n\nTo be fair, the Aria did stand out for me in one area, and one area alone: the staff. Everyone I interacted with, from the front desk to the waitstaff to housekeeping to the valets, concierge, casino staff, convention area staff, etc. were all pleasant and professional. The staff are the only reason why this place gets a generous two stars instead of one.",0
2441,"Warning! More than half their seating is outside. It's Wednesday afternoon on a hot summer day. We walked in and were seated right away.....at the outside patio. Sure it was tolerable (barely) because of the misters but at least ASK if that's ok. The hostess doesn't seem very friendly but that may be because of the heat. \n\nOur waitress was friendly but initially forgot our water and later condiments.\n\nWe were brought a carafe of water and two little bitty glasses.....did I mention it was about 110 degrees out. But the Coke I ordered (because it was included in lunch special) was in a huge glass:/\n\nOn to the important stuff, the food!\n\nThai crispy wings-delicious! Flavor soaked into the meat. The sauce they serve with it is a mayo base, not that great so at least the wings were good. \n\nPanang curry with chicken-average, good but nothing special\n\nBeef and meatball noodle soup-average, good but needs some work.\n\nPad Thai-delicious! Pleasantly surprised:)\n\nWe ordered everything spicy number 4 out of 5 and they delivered what we expected.

2442,"After hearing that this place was not only the talk of the town but also our esteemed President's favorite, I figured I'd give it a try.  Sadly, I'm not impressed.\n\nThere was nothing wrong with my dinner, but I expect a burger and fries costing $11+ to be more than just ok.  In the end though, Five Guys tastes like a neighborhood cookout.  The burger was fine--nothing unexpected, and the fries tasted homemade.  \n\nThey seem to be going for a less-is-more motif in the store.  Unfortunately, it just comes off as cold and cheap--In-N-Out does the clean 50s diner look a lot better, and Smashburger does the upscale burger menu better.\n\nIt won't kill you, but you'll feel like you got overcharged.",0

It is definitely a worthwhile destination for a pancake lover.",1
2444,"We came here after enjoying a delicious pulled pork sandwich at taste of Glendale.  Unfortunately, they were out of the pulled pork:(  We decided on a chicken sandwich and Sonoran dog along with some onion rings.  The onion rings were delicious!! The hot dog and the chicken sandwich had a great flavor.  The only issue was that the chicken was somewhat dry.  The wifi did not work and no one knew anything about it. Overall it had a nice ambience and we would definitely come again. Maybe next time we will get to have the pulled pork sandwich.",1
2445,"If it's your first visit, here's a bit of advice:  in the vestibule, before you enter the store, take a number. This is the same procedure whether you are just there for a loaf of bread or are going to stay and have coffee and a croissant. Knowing your numbers from 1-99 in French will help you get served. If not, look up at the red glowy number behind the counter to the left.\n\nKind of an eclectic atmosphere in the seating upstairs. Bonus points for having a coffee-doctoring station (milk, cream, sugar, napkins,...) upstairs so that you don't have to run back downstairs with your cup of tea or java.\n\nDefinitely very good pastries. For my money, Olive & Gourmando or Premi\u00e8re Moisson are better, but these are very good. Coffee, meh.",1

However, the poor customer service always leaves me grimacing as we walk out the door.

2451,"Wow, after reading everyones reviews, I know I'm right about our experience last weekend.  We've been going here to eat off and on over the past 7 years or so.  We've always enjoyed our meal. It's been about a year since we've gone. \n\nThe menu has changed somewhat so we couldn't order what we normally use to order.  Wow, terrible choice.  We decided to order light and just order a  spicy tuna and salmon roll for each of us.  They were so hot we couldn't eat them.  My husband didn't think the rice was made that well.  My husband and I never go home with take out when we go out for Sushi.  Out of 12 pieces each, we each ate 4.  What does that tell you?   I told the waiters working at the counter that it was to hot and they said that we ordered Spicy Tuna and Spicy Salmon.  No one said,  \""""we're sorry, what can do we do for you to make it better\"""". \n\nMy children who are in their 20's tried it and also agreed with us.   They are both avid sushi eaters.  I called the owner and talked to him personally that evening.    He said he would check into it for me and get back to me with what he found out.  He never did.  I called him a few minutes ago.    He said that his workers made it normal and that is the way they make it. They didn't put any extra hot spice in it.    I guess the customer is always wrong.  We will never step foot into this establishment and give them our money.  There are to many other sushi places  in the Scottsdale area to go out to eat.  The sushi rolls at Safeway are better and more enjoyable.",0

2453,"I travel to Pittsburgh for business 5-6 times a year and pretty much eat my way through the city. Last trip, I grudgingly stayed on the north shore because most hotels were booked.  The Hotel breakfast was brutal and the Post Gazette led me to this little joint five minutes away. First impressions?  Hip, warm, and comfortable with a lot of smiling faces...not something usually seen down here in Florida. Second?  The breakfast bagel was freaking amazing. I see that has been said a few times. It's true. They don't screw around with the ingredients, instead letting them speak for themselves. Ham edges crispy. Big fluffy layers of whipped eggs. Excellent quality cheese.   Also, the coffee smelled so good tht I decided to veer from my norm and opted for a flavored blend. Delicious. As I sipped on Green Mountain at the office later that afternoon, I wish that I could have called in a delivery. \n\nThe next day, I worked from the hotel in the morning and then stopped by again to try lunch before heading to the office. Got a steak and cheese sandwich, chips, and some oatmeal moon pie cream cookie....which was staring me in the face and broke my will. Everything was just as good as the previous morning. And the value is amazing. \n\nFinally, it's awesome to see owners and workers that so obviously care about their place, the community, and most of all their customers.

Our service was pretty good but a little slow and the she forgot several items.

2457,"The only reason I am not annoyed at the inability to give ZERO stars is because we did enjoy the soaking tub and the Fun Dungeon. Also we saw a show at NYNY and went over there for shopping and the roller coaster which was convenient.\n\nFirst of all the time share people are unacceptably aggravating! Accosting you at every turn.\n\nI normally stay elsewhere. Its difficult to find rooms with soaking tubs just by going to websites, you have to call from one place to another to find them half the time and even then they are not plentiful (or the rooms are well over a grand for 3 nights). The hotel we normally stay at DOES have them but they were sold out for the weekend (I did book 5 weeks in advance) of that type of room and we wanted that treat, otherwise we probably would have stuck with what we knew.\n\nWe've gone to the Excalibur before on multiple occasions because we like Dick's Last Resort and we've also gone to the Tournament of Kings. So for about 600 dollars we spent 3 nights \n\nThankfully we didn't spend a whole heck of a lot of time in our room.\n\nOnly one of my issues is something completely out of the control of the hotel and that would be the noise. We've never stayed in a room facing the strip before and we were on the corner in tower 2 so there was traffic, loud motorcycles, sirens from ambulances and police, as well as screaming from the roller coaster (this stopped around midnight though, thankfully)\n\n(Enjoying the roller coaster and listening to it whenever your in your room for any period of time can become annoying)\n\nOur room was the FARTHEST room from the elevator, so ALL the way across the casino, then all the way back to the VERY end of the hall in tower 2. This may be because the room had a \""""soaking tub\""""\n\nOur room was.... a shambles. Here is the description of what our room professes to be (snippets from the actual description on their site)\n\n\"""" Contemporary Superior Room, reign in this beautiful room. Soaking tub and luxurious bathroom featuring granite counter tops. High-speed Internet access.\n\nContemporary means updated (doesn't it?) This room had a thin blanket that was not really big enough for a king bed with 2 sleeping in it and a thin duvet (more like a sheet covering it) I shouldn't have to crank up the heat because I was given a beggars blanket. but the cover over the thin blanket seemed to be the newest thing in the room. \n\nThe wallpaper was peeling (badly in some places), the tiles in the bathroom were so chipped it looked like someone spilled dirt all over and then didn't bother to sweep it up, the wallpaper had obvious patches in it and then was painted over (if this room was updated WHY wasn't the wallpaper torn down and the room painted, its SO easy and makes a huge difference), the door stop behind the bathroom door was falling out, the chairs by the table were threadbare, the table itself was gouged and deeply scratched (which was made worse by the fact that it was painted black so every scuff made it look cheap and neglected, and there was also a broken cover plate to the plug receptacle.\n\nI was so disgusted I took pictures of all of the things that were tangible. \n\nOther issues I had?\n\nThe Internet being included in your resort fee being only via Ethernet is VERY outdated and misleading, I brought an iPad I couldnt use that Internet. Also the cord didn't even reach the bed, you'd have had to drag a threadbare chair over and sat right next to the dresser where the Ethernet cord was tethered. There was wireless, but it was in the lobby. Who uses Ethernet in a hotel?\n\nThe tiling was crooked in the bathroom, this isn't something easily fixed, just another testament to how shoddy the entire place was.\n\nThe window shade by the tub was broken completely so you couldn't look out that window while in the bath, (this is a simple and cheap fix, just like the cover plate would have been)\n\nThe clover tub was OK, but there was a little plastic sign sitting near the tub (not stuck or screwed in or anything) giving instructions on how to use the jacuzzi and what all the knobs meant, but it was a clover TUB not a jacuzzi, there was ONLY hot/cold, not a complaint, but still misleading.\n\nIn the halls there was graffiti on lighting fixtures (I only took a picture of one but we saw several) and huge dark scuffs on the wall paper in the halls.\n\nAnother thing that really bothered me was I've never been bugged by security before in a casino (EVER) and neither has my guy, but there was someone being loud and belligerent with a security guard as we were heading out somewhere and I don't know what it was about but he was drunk and it was unsettling.\n\nI will NEVER stay here again. We will come back for Dick's Last Resort, because that place is awesome but for the price I paid just for an over-sized tub in our room, it was absolutely not worth it.\n\nThe Valets and Bellmen were very nice.",0

As for Buy Rite, the third time my machine broke, the warranty called them out instead of the repair place I had the first two times.  Buy-Rite came out and looked at my machine for a whole 5 minutes and diagnosed it.  Waited a full week without a working machine before the repair company came back with a part, fixed it and tried to leave before testing the machine.  I had them run a cycle and wouldn't you know the machine did the same thing I initially called about.  \n\nI was told they'd have to go through the warranty for approval of the part (this was 3-19-14).  It's now the 28th and there has been no updates until I called them.  I was told they're still waiting for approval for the part.  I call my warranty and they confirm - still waiting on approval.

2463,"walter g is right, the wings basically taste like sauce. but thats what they are famous for. \n\nthey  have about 20 or so different types of flavored wings, if you're someone that likes to try little samplettes of different stuff, you can get the 24 wings and get 4 different flavors of wings and split it with a friend. \n\ni tried the carribean jerk, teriyaki, garlic parmasean, and asian spice.\n\nif you eat 12 of their 'blazin' wings within 6 mins, you can get your picture on their wall. \n\ni feel like i can handle my heat pretty well, so i asked the server for a sample of the blazin sauce, and i'd have to say that it is pretty spicey, but i feel like it was kind of hyped, it was expecting it to be way more spicier, so spicy where you can't taste if it is salty or flavored, its just straight spicy.\n\nit was actually pretty good tasting, i would try maybe one wing just to say that i tried it, but i would suggest you do it after you try all the other flavors, b/c i tried blazin before everything else, and everything else didn't seem spicy afterwards since your tastebuds are pretty muched seasoned to the spiciest one first. the caribbean jerk was pretty spicy good, it was an enjoyable reasonable kinda of spicy. blazin made the top of my nose sweat a little. hahaha\n\ngarlic parmasean pretty much tastes like garlic bread but in the chicken form. \n\nteryiaki was good b/c it was nice and sweet and made the chicken kinda caramelized. asian pretty much tasted like sweet and sour sauce but with some chili pepper.\n\nmango jabanero wasn't as spicy as i thought it would be, it was kinda good b/c it was nice and sweet and mangoey. \n\nthe onion rings were pretty good, it comes with liek a chipotle mayo sauce, and the small size, the portion size was pretty good for what you pay for. i thought everything was resonably priced and tasted pretty good.\n\nthe restaurant is pretty big, there is no wait, and its open 24 hrs. they have tons of sports playing everywhere, we stayed after our meal was over to watch the new american gladiators on the huge projection screen (only one that has sound). other screens are on mute. \n\nservice was good, all the servers are girls in t heir 20's in football jersey type shirts. pretty quick with your requets for more water  when your mouth is on fire. \n\ntheir dessert menu is not that great, we opted not to get dessert there b /c nothing sounded very tantalizing.",1
2464,"I wanted to treat my girlfriend to a wonderful seafood lunch to someplace we never tried before,and this place had great reviews. I literally watched my food get cold in the window while I watched my server serve several other tables that came in after my table. I spent over $150 on two people and she was a terrible server. I had to track down other waiters to get our drinks refilled and to ask for my food that I knew was sitting at the pass. I feel terrible tipping less than 25% because I used to serve tables, however I left our awful waitress $1 and a message on the bill, and I used no profanity. I politely told her to use better practices when serving customers.When I did find other waiters to serve us refills, she would come over and just drop the drink off without saying anything. I actually had to ask another waiter to grab our bill. It isn't like we were curt or loud, and I always make sure when I go out with people that they are polite to the waitstaff! She just ignored us. I will never recommend this restaurant or ever patronize this establishment again!!!!!!",0
2465,"This place is ok, the two people they had working on the food order side preparing the food were not the best they have ever had.  Everything we had on this visit was over cooked and not very tasty, a huge disappointment this time.\n\nWe probably will go back, but they have to get the people they normally have back there preparing the food otherwise this will not be a place we frequent for a meal.  Normally we don't leave without ordering other items to go as for a bakery they do have some pretty good items, however, most if not all have cinnamon in their items which is a bad point for me.",0
2466,"Clean facilities, good atmosphere and a strong selection of the latest equipment.\n\nWhat I like most City Athletic Club though, is the idea that it's trainer driven. It provides a space for mutual respect and also unencumbered personal training. Meaning you get the most out of what you're there for. This is the gym for the serious - no matter what level you're at.",1
2467,"First off, most people don't know what they are saying. The English guy behind the bar is very attentive and his wife makes the best cupcakes I've ever had. This place deserves six stars, however, yelp in all it's wisdom only allows 5 so that will have to do. So take your girlfriend and \""""bite her and twist\"""" your way down to this place if you have a sane brain cell left in your head. It's no accident the accidental connoisseur is the second best thing besides the English bloats wife's cupcake that you will put in your head here.",1
2468,"Second time we stayed here. Across street from Bellagio and Ceasar's. Great location. Hotel is only 4 floors. Out of your room and on sidewalk in 3 minutes.( Big hotels take 15-20 min. to hit street.) \n\nPositives: 42\"""" flat screen T.V., Excellent and rapid heating/cooling and quiet, great hot water and skin stripping shower pressure (no dribble), swing open leaded glass window in shower and watch Bellagio fountains while showering (fresh air in room),ample drawer space, table with 2 chairs, for the price this is luxury!!!!\n\nNegatives: If room is up front near Strip and facing Flamingo Blvd. the traffic and tourist noise can be QUITE loud at night. Recommend facing Flamingo Hotel on other side of hallway.\n\nWill stay here again. This hotel is owned by Harrah's.",1
2469,This is such a great little neighborhood spot! I've been here several times since we moved to Mesa and service is always great. Food is great! I haven't had a dish that I didn't like and I've had a variety from their menu. If they forget something or make an error they most definitely make up for it before you leave. That's really all you can ask for!,1
2470,"Came in last night for my birthday. The place was packed with a waiting line but we had reservations for our party. Steve, our waiter, was amazing and handled our group of 7 adults with swift precision and courtesy. Everyone in our party was impressed with their appetizers & entre's. It was a great experience. Members of our party also kept commenting favorably about the \""""Old Las Vegas\"""" selection of music classics by Martin, Sinatra, etc. A lot of food so plan on a to-go box.",1
2471,"We came on Saturday night, prime dinner time, with a group-on, and although we were seated right away, we didn't receive our drinks until at least 25 minutes in (my husband starting timing when the wait became extraordinary) and then they ran out of our appetizer, so we had to reorder, and it then came with the entrees at once all ten minutes later. Yes it was busy and they were overwhelmed, but Restaurant 101 should be to serve your wine first & early so the customers aren't so conscious of waiting. Also, some of the waiters were definitely doing housekeeping tasks (filing receipts, etc) instead of getting us our drinks. The food was a-ok for Thai Food, tasty, but not the most steller ingredients (all of the veggies were frozen, etc). All in all, happy to see diversity in the Chandler restaurant scene, but I expected better.",0
2472,"These guys are thieves!  \nI accompanied my wife to the store one day to have a headlight bulb installed.  I tried but was afraid I'd break something, so we let them do it.  The $25 installation charge wasn't the problem; the problem occurred when the service technician approached my wife and told her she needed a new set of tires and her AT fluid flushed, along with an oil change.\nOur oil is full synthetic and was just changed 2 months prior and only accumulated 3,000 miles since then.  The AT has absolutely no issues and shouldn't be flushed so soon; absolutely no reason.  The tires had tons of available tread on them, so we went around the corner to discount tires, where they told us we didn't need tires for at least another 20,000 miles!  Go figure.  Pep Boys Technicians have little honesty.",0
2473,"My absolute favorite Thai Food in the valley. I have been to the Chandler and Tempe locations and now the Scottsdale location. The Green Curry with Shrimp is my favorite dish. Have tried a few other dishes which were amazing as well, but the green curry keeps me coming back. I highly recommend Thai Basil.",1
2474,YUM!  I had the best ham and cheese sandwich here for lunch with this totally awesome jalapeno cole slaw.  I can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu which looked a LOT better than most sports bars' menus.  Service was excellent too.,1
2475,"Great service! Kimberly, our server, was prompt with our orders, she was very polite and courtious. The manager stopped by and checked on us twice. Everything tasted amazing. This was my boyfriends first time here and he was very impressed. Price was not bad at all!",1
2476,"I definitely wanted this place to be better than it was. The Japanese tapas items weren't bad, but everything was pretty lacklustre, over all. I had the gyoza dumplings, which were decent, and the spicy chicken on rice, which was a big disappointment in terms of spice and flavouring. As far as the decor, the rear of the restaurant is lovely and a nice place to sit if you're in a group, but up-front it's all leftover diner pieces.",0
2477,"Being from Hawaii we decided to try this place we were so disappointed the fried won ton was like mini gau gee without the meat.  the duck was greasy and mostly fat, the beef brocolli cake noodles lacking and manapua really?  maybe it was an off day but I do not think I would go again.",0
2478,Brian was very friendly and easy to work with about getting my car detailed.  He did an amazing job with extreme attention to detail.  He worked with my schedule and even walked me over to the light rail station so that I could go run some errands while he worked on my car.  He takes obvious pride in his work! I have already recommended him to friends and will continue doing so!,1
2479,Solid sports bar! Went here for the women's world cup finals and had a great time. Bloody mary's were awesome and the appetizers were a nice surprise. The jalapeno poppers were yummy and the sliders were nice too. Service was great and I'll definitely be back...they've got Murphy's on tap!!,1
2480,"I was waiting for 10 minutes in the drive-thru, the girl finally comes over and checks on my script.  She tells me that it's not done and I tell her that my doc called it in before noon (it was currently 6pm when I was there).  She says, \""""We just got it in. Do you want to wait a couple of minutes and drive back around or wait inside?\"""".  Mind you that I am horribly sick that is why I chose the drive-thru. However, I went inside and waited in a ten people deep line. She calls me up and I grab my crap and leave.  As I was driving away, I saw the promised time on my prescription 12:46pm!!!! She lied to my face because she skimmed through the pile and didn't find it???  \n\nEvery single time I go there I wait more than ten minutes! There's at least five people working in the back!",0
2481,"Yuck!  Why did I do this to myself?  I was running a few errands on Christmas eve afternoon and I decided to grab a sandwich for lunch.  \n\nI could tell these poor bastards running the place didn't want to be there but I wasn't making it hard on them, I just wanted a vegetarian sub.  The bread was old and smushed (resembling a slice of plain white bread) the toppings were unimaginative and sparce and the cheese was overly processed into something resembling Velveta.\n\nIf you want a sandwhich, don't waste your time here... Einstein's, Quizno's, even Subway could do better.",0
2482,"For their Henderson location, I like not having to drive over to Spring Mountain for Vietnamese cuisine and the range of offerings on the menu is extensive.

2483,"Made my first trip to Bojangles while visiting Charlotte this past weekend... I LOVE biscuits and this was clearly the place to go for that! I ordered some chicken, mac & cheese, a plain biscuit, and 2 cinnamon biscuits... the best part of the meal was clearly the biscuits... other food was just ok.  I love these biscuits, especially those heavenly cinnamon biscuits!",1
2484,"Was awesome?!?! Went just to hike for fun and happened that there was a moonlight hike at 730. So our hike lead us to the moonlight hike at perfect time and to say the least very neat experience, interesting history and gave us Blacklight's to see scorpions glow in the dark! We will be back.",1
2485,"I've now been to Pizza Rock twice. First things first, why not 5 stars? Basically because I've been here twice and I have never been told that locals receive 20% off their bill. What the heck Pizza Rock? I don't typically go around asking, Hey can I get a local discount? But. When I've been here twice and sung its praises to people - and yet, I've been able to get 20% off but haven't? Arg. That ruffles my feathers.\n\nOn to what is GOOD. Happy hour is awesome. Personal pizzas, apps, well drinks, and cocktails all on the cheap. My friends and I came here during HH and split all three of the personal pizzas and shared the meatballs. Okay. I'm no meatball expert but I think these are delicious. Meaty, not bready, and the sauce it comes with compliments very well. I also like that these meatballs are simple. I've had way too many meatballs that have way too much going on with them. Another reason I like them: you can cut them down the middle with your fork and they fall away in two pieces, not a bunch of lumpy, gross meat pieces. Quality. I think.\n\nOther than HH.... I came here with my hubby on a Saturday night. Luckily they have plenty of 2-top tables so we were seated quickly. Service was quick and to the point. Our server neither impressed me or upset me so I'll give a neutral rating for service.\n\nWhat we ordered... The New Yorker 23. It was the one pizza on the menu I figured my picky (and rather plain-Jane) husband would enjoy. The New Yorker comes with: Sliced Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Sliced House Link Sausage, Garlic, Pepperoni, Ricotta. I asked for the link sausages to be removed and replaced with mushrooms. They were happy to oblige. Under the menu it says, \""""Winner, Best Traditional, Las Vegas\"""". I'm not sure what that means.\n\nOverall thoughts on the pizza... I enjoyed it. I love the thin crust style. The mix of cheese and sauce was perfect. Pepperoni... Okay. The Ricotta cheese was an awesome addition, creamy and slightly sweet offsetting the heartiness of the pepperoni and garlic. The flavors were that of a \""""normal\"""" pizza, but with a refinement. I think this was a perfect way to satisfy my more adventurous side and my husband's more traditional side.\n\nFinal decision: Mine and my husband's dinner was a bit pricey. Although delicious, I would rather go back for the happy hour. HH is your best bet here. And ya, go ahead and throw in the fact you're a local. You'll probably get a discount, unlike me. I'd also be interested in just heading up to the take out window to take a slice to go.\n\nOther things I want to go back for:\n\nTheir Margherita (only 73 made per day)\nClam and Garlic Pizza\nLa Regina (The Gold Cup Winner)\nQuail Egg White Rose Potato Guanciale Pizza\nCal Italia (again, this comes as one of the Personal Pizzas on HH menu and is a FoodNetwork winner)\nThe Chorizo Mussels (App)\nAnd I would come back again for the meatballs.\n\nLooks, like I'll be making a few return trips. The great thing is, I am so happy there is a good, inventive pizza place so close to where I live now.",1
2486,Been here a couple of times so far. Each time the service has been great and the food great as well. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich both times but their coleslaw is a bit strange as I'm not accustomed to a mustard based slaw. My husband ordered the Brunswick stew both times and its very good. Their sweet tea is pretty awesome too. The banana pudding is pretty darn good too. Oh and they seat you immediately even when the place is packed. Basically you can't go wrong with Bill Spoons....,1
2487,"Easily one of the best coffee shops in charlotte. They are in a great spot in the middle of atherton market, so it's perfect to grab a coffee and unwind after you do your shopping for the week. Tons of great coffee options including pour overs, but my favorite is anything with their homemade caramel. It's divine and just the right amount of saltiness. \nIf you're lucky enough to stop by when they have them, pick up a \""""not your mom's donut\"""" to go with your morning caffeine fix.",1
2488,I have been to a couple of the other Classic Car Spas and this location is by far the best. They do a great job and are very friendly.  My car is always immaculate. Chris was very helpful and didn't try to upsale me things I didn't need. I'll drive a few extra miles to come back here.,1
2489,Scum bag owners. Worst customers service ever. \nOne owner Jorge Lolpez tried over charge fuel+carwash for drop off\nhaul's truck.... I called the company for complain about this jerk guy\nwith attitude and I change drop off the truck in different location with\nno charge. Don't go here this guy don't deserve any kind business.,0
2490,"Unfortunately i have to leave one star but its not even worth that. I was excited to try this place, now I m excited  to leave and never come back. Took over an hour to get a burger which was way over cooked almost burned (did not ask for well well done) and tasteless along with mayo that tasted more like garlic than real mayo. If you looking to pay top dollars for food that has no taste this is the right place.",0
2491,"My first time going this October with my boy friend, due to his recommendations from a previous time he was here. But it was both our first time here at the bar section and I can say they did not disappoint us! The view was just fabulous and the drinks are 2 for 1 special from 11 to 3! How can you say no to that! The area is so spacious surrounded by multiple chairs around the bar and small tables and chairs around the whole floor to order drinks and food from. You get free admission when you tell them you want to go to the 10 lounge and buy a drink, then from there you are able to go to the top floor where they have all the rides and even a better view of the whole las vegas strip! It's just beautiful at night. It took my breath away! Make sure to bring a jacket if you are going to be here for the drinks and the view because it does tend to get colder the higher up you go. \nKuddos for the employees regulating the elevators as they were fun and helping us manuvour over to the next floor, higher and higher.",1
2492,"We made it a point to go to Mandalay specifically for Burger Bar since the reviews are so spectacular.  \n\nThe food was fantastic, the service was fantastic, and it was the only place in Mandalay packed at 12 in the afternoon.  That speaks for itself.  My only gripe is that they didn't have any beer or drink specials.  That's pretty lame.  I thought it would be more chic for some reason.   Other than that, Burger Bar met the expectation.  I'll be hitting them up EVERY TRIP!",1
2493,"\""""SOCIAL STATUS\"""" IS BS!\n\nI was concerned with my online order because they had a fire in their Charlotte store and the lady told me over the phone AND email that my order won't be affected because online orders are from the warehouse not their stores. \n\nThen yesterday, they only ship out 1 pair of shoes (Asics GT2 \""""Navy/Red\"""") that's not very expensive and high in demand. I emailed them about my 2nd pair of shoes, NB M998RO which retailed at $160 - 50% off = $80, and now they tell me \""""it's out of stock.\""""\n\nI CALL BS ON THEIR FIRE! I believe they started the fire themselves and claiming insurance fraud on most of our orders. They have 4 HUGE stores in North Carolina and Pennsylvania! There's no sneaker community there; there's no way they could've made enough profit to sustain their business. This is my assumption because most people I know had their orders cancelled! They probably used those sales to be included in the damages/lost in the fire. \n\nI'm so disappointed. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and even defended them too.",0
2494,"I scheduled an appointment, waited three days, rearranged my schedule to meet with them for estimates; They call me 5 hours before the scheduled appointment telling me they can't make it. They want to schedule for the next day. I have to work. Not good!\n\nI don't know what their skills are like, but my time is valuable... How about yours?\n\nUpdate: The owner of the company came over to my property and presented himself in a Professional way.  As things progress, I will update here and perhaps improve my rating for this company.",0
2495,"AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THEY SERVE SALMONELLA!!!\n\nOur dining experience at this restaurant was the worst I can remember!  We sat for over:15 minutes with no waiter and only after we went to the hostess did the waiter show up.\n\nI ordered what the waiter claimed was their \""""signature\"""" dish, Paella Latorre.  It was served with ice cold mussels and the entire dish was less than warm.  I called over the waiter and explained. :15 minutes later he returned with the dish and claimed the chef had \""""re-heated\"""" it.  While the plate was hot the food was still tepid.  I called the waiter over again and told him.  He argued that he \""""saw\"""" the chef reheat the food.  By this time, my business associate had almost completed his meal so I ate as much as I could and left about 1/3.\n\nWe told the waiter that we expected the restaurant to do something about the check.  He returned with the credit card receipt and said there was nothing he could do.  We called the manager to the table and he refused to see our point and said there was nothing he WOULD do.\n\nThe following week I contacted Blerim Meta, the General Manager of this restaurant as well as \""""Aquavina\"""".  He has also refused to do anything and also refused to apologize for the terrible experience.\n\nAVOID THIS RESTAURANT!!  AVOID AQUAVINA!!",0
2496,"This was the second time eating at this location and it was absolutely awful. The first time we ordered a deep dish pizza and the stupid delivery boy must have set it funny in his car because all of the cheese and sauce were crammed to one side of the box and there wasn't a scrap left on the actual pizza...gross.  My office used to order from the one on Power for lunch at least once a month and they had the BEST chicken parm I have ever had! This location however, it was not even edible. Instead of an actual chicken breast it was about 5-6 slices of chicken about the size of my finger that were all dried out and mostly burned, also the spaghetti that was in some nasty, watery, marinara soup was burned on the top. How is it possible to burn spaghetti?! Went right I the trash.",0
2497,"The orange chicken was on the chewy side but had a decent taste, the pork fried rice was very bland, the pork egg roll was pretty damn good but very greasy. \n\nI eat a lot and the combo plate filled me up, and was about what I expected to pay. The sanitation issues in this restaurant are remarkable, and I believe are the reasons I spent the next day on the toilet.\n\nWhen I come into your business with money in hand I expect that at the very least you will welcome me. I am very choosy at where I spend my money, but am not hard to please, customer service is paramount. With that said due to my experience at this place, I doubt I will be back.",0
2498,"The place is good. Think of it as going to your neighbor's BBQ. This place isn't gourmet, but who cares. It taste like normal food over the standard commercialized food, which is an awesome change of pace.\n\nThe only thing I'd change is the amount of food. I got a Guac cheeseburger and fries and went back for a little one... and STILL was hungry. Ha!",1
2499,"My coworkers and I placed a large order to-go and the food came out pretty fast. Once we started eating though... Oh boy...

When we called and informed the restaurant, they told us we could bring it back. \n\nChicken and Dumpling soup. BLAND. Not like grandma's at all!!! It's made with biscuits, not actual homemade dumplings. Tasted like garlic biscuits. \n\nI personally would not order from here again.

2500,great cheap gas station!! I'm always putting in gas for my road trips downtown!:) they even have cones that separate lines so that cars don't get into crazy turning accidents after gassing up! \n\nIt's so useful for Costcos to have all these things in one place! I don't put gas anywhere else:),1
2501,"We like Mexican food, and this was only 'food' from the standpoint that we were no longer hungry afterwards, but unfortunately also regretful for having invested time in chewing... and waiting.  Allow me to explain... The trio of salsas brought out with tortillas as we were seated were all but tasteless.  The 'made just for you, table-side guacomole' was too salty, too much lime juice, not enough avocado - the ratios just weren't right, and this was sadly the theme of the meal.  The ceviche was OK, but was almost exclusively shrimp... where was the lobster that was also supposed to be in this pricey appetizer?  Obviously, ceviche needs acid to 'cook' the protein, but the acid wasn't balanced or complex.  So the tastes of salt and lime where first, middle and last.  We've had much better for much less cost in places less exotic than Las Vegas, such as Chicago. \n\nThe considerable lag between tortillas and 'real food' was annoying and the music was loud.  The saturation of red in the decor was interesting from the outside but more gloomy than mood-setting once we were seated and the images on the video screens were jarring and did not contribute positively to enjoying food. \n\n I ordered two appetizers and a side as my meal, wanting to try a wider variety of their offerings that just an entree might have provided.  Queso Fundido - primary taste: salt.  Stringy cheese is always fun, but that was the highlight of my meal, this generous portion of blah.  I adore goat, but this could have been any kind of stringy, salty but otherwise tasteless protein, a mealy mastication chore.  I can't remember what the 'side' was called, but was disappointed that it was regular button mushrooms smothered in a heavy, all-but-tasteless cream.  I have never tried properly prepared corn smut and was hopeful that this was what I'd be getting.  But, no.  For those of you who might be curious, \""""Huitlacoche (\""""wee-tlah-KOH-cheh\""""), also referred to as Mexican corn truffle, can be eaten either cooked or fresh.\""""  My husband's black beans were not as satisfying as any you could have gotten from a can and his chile rellenos (sp?) where apparently plated cold because they welded together into a dough ball with cheese in the middle.  Our overwhelming impression was food that was unimaginatively interpreted/prepared/presented, over-salted and only appropriate for the most flaccid of tastebuds. \n\nI gave a '2' because the pitcher of margarita was pretty good, though I am not a liquor connoisseuse.  On the other hand, the number of antacids needed to help put the memory of this meal behind us should be the better indicator of 'don't bother with this place'.",0
2502,"Cheap tables, cheap drinks, cheap food... smells of farts pretty much 24/7. Sure, you can get a footlong hotdog for $1.99 but chances are it's full of random animal colons and eyeballs.

2504,"I just purchased my gown at Uptown Bridal today and couldn't be happier with my experience working with Diane. Here are some of the ways my experience here stood out from the rest of the stores:\n\nI sat down with Diane to talk about the feel of my wedding and likes and dislikes and, unlike some of the other salons that I visited, I believe she really understood my taste based upon the selection of gowns that she pulled.\n\nI received one-on-one attention from her the entire time. In fact, there was never more than one other customer in the shop at the same time. They provide a slip and accessories and help you into each gown (one shop had me dress myself).\n\nFor a small boutique, the gown selection is diverse including gowns that others didn't carry. There were more than enough gowns to suite my niche taste. \n\nThe cost of the gowns are very reasonable. I was able to get a lux and sophisticated gown within my budget. (It makes me wonder how David's Bridal can stay in business asking similar prices for poor material and used-car style sales environment.)\n \nMost importantly, I was never pressured into anything--gowns or immediate purchase. In fact, they suggested that I take some time to think about it and not rush into any decision.\n\nI would recommend Uptown Bridal to anyone that appreciates quality craftsmanship  and unique details in a gown and genuine customer service.",1

2507,"Had a late lunch at Luciano's - my first visit. Lovely decor, and the menu looked good. They offered a 3- course Salad-main-dessert at lunch for $12.95. The Cesar's salad was excellent - fresh crisp, lighted dressed and served on a chilled plate. Good start!\nHowever, the main course was a pasta dish that was inedible. And could I even find a waiter or bus boy to bring me salt & pepper? No. Finally the manager realized I wasn't eating and no one was around, so she asked me about the food, and quickly offered to bring me something else. That was classy. (Just for reference - I don't think I've EVER sent back a meal at a fine dining restaurant. I'm not that type of picky patron, but I just couldn't swallow this dish.) Unfortunately, even after the second main course arrived, I couldn't get my waitress' attention to get the check for what seemed like days.\nBetween the dreadful pasta and the poor service, I doubt I'll ever be back in spite of the fact that I give the Manager kudos for handling a difficult situation gracefully.",0

Bathrooms are single stalls, and the doors to the bathrooms are that frosty glass material so you can see the silhouette of whoever is in the bathroom.  So from the bar we clearly saw 2 silhouettes getting their freak on.  \n\nMusic was good and the DJ mixed it up.  My hubby and I were able to get a spot at the bar and there was plenty of empty tables.  I'm not sure if this bar is normally quiet on Friday nights, the bartendar said that it wasn't typical for a Friday night, regardless it was a chill spot.  \n\nStick to the beer unless you want to pay $10+ for mixed drinks.  Although mixed drinks are a bit pricey, they are really good! \n\nCheck out this bar if you want a chill spot.",1
2509,"I have been to this Smith & Wollensky location at least 5 times previously. At one time it was What Smith & Wollensky should be; A great steak house. Sadly, no more. \n\nI've been to at least 7 or 8 other Smith & Wollensky properties around the US. This meal, in a word, sucked. It wasn't so much that the food was so bad (it was not even good though), it was that the waiter lied. Flat out lied.\n\nThere were only 3 of us. Two ordered a filet and I ordered the aged rib steak. My steak was not an aged piece of meat. I know aged meat. It was fatty with a kind of fat that is not the texture seen in aged beef. It didn't have the rich beefy flavor that aged steak attains. It was also a bit overcooked...to about medium. Additionally, it shrank too much to be aged. When the food was delivered to the table, one of the filets was missing. The waiter said he put the order in. He didn't. We saw him put it into the computer. He had forgotten to put it in. I told him to take the two steaks back to the kitchen to re-fire and he said the one that was left in the kitchen would be out in a minute. It wasn't. It took 7 minutes. We timed it. By the time the third steak came out...neither of us wanted to eat without the other steak on the table...my $50 rib was cold and when our third guest finally cut into her filet, it was not medium rare...it was medium raw. Totally raw and cold in the middle. First, the waiter tried to say it was correct. It was blue, which is rarer than rare. He reluctantly took the steak back to the kitchen and it came back medium, not medium rare. We gave up. The manager sent over one of the massive desserts, which was nice but really didn't change the overall tenor of the meal.\n\nThe wine I ordered came with a different vintage. I really don't appreciate that. And it's beneath a restaurant wine list that's supposed to be the 'caliber' of S & W's wine list. Just because this S& W is on the Las Vegas strip doesn't mean the service, the wine list and the management suck. But they do. S&W here probably thinks that everyone is a tourist and will never darken their door again. Well, for sure i won't darken their door and I'm in Las Vegas at least 3 times a year and used to eat at S&W almost every time along with recommending this restaurant. No more.\n\nBad table waiting, bad management, bad food all around.\n\nToo bad. It could be a great oasis on the strip.",0
2510,"The service is usually sub-par, and the food is just \""""okay\"""". The prices aren't bad and they have a great location, which is the only thing that has kept my business. They usually have good beer on tap, so that's a plus.",0
2511,"While pho  is within price range of other places, I can not say the same for their appetizer and rice dish.  Their rice dish is at $14 plate.  I think this place is trying to come off as an expensive Vietnamese restaurant but the location and ugly sign says otherwise.",0
2512,"Love it!  Love it!  Love it!  I have been to most gyms in the Phoenix area (and Boston, for that matter), and Lifetime is definitely at the top.  I just convinced most of my family to join.  Has everything you need and then some!\n\nUpdate:  While I still love this place, the maintenance is quite lacking.  Pieces of equipment will be broken for over a month or more before they are fixed.  I am pretty diligent about reporting equipment that needs to be repaired/maintained, but apparently the staff at Lifetime is not so diligent about getting things fixed.  Very unfortunate, especially for a fitness center of this caliber and at the cost of the memberships.",1
2513,"Service: I asked the clerk what would be a good meal for a family of four. He gave his recommendation and I went with it. Got the meal home and we only have 1 mac and cheese, 1 potato salad 5 rolls. Now, this wasn't some big Styrofoam container. It was just enough for one person. The clerk seemed like it was a pain for him to answer some questions about the food that is keeping him employed. \n\nFood: It was ok. Not great, just okay. There wasn't anything that screamed \""""Have seconds!\"""" The sauce is decent. Nothing spectacular. \n\nOverall, it was a 2 because nothing blew me away. I just made some ribs tonight on the grill and I thought they were better than Honey's. \nIf you're craving bbq, then this will get you out of a pinch. But if you want the \""""Slap yo momma\"""" type grub, then make an about face.",0
2514,"The food at this place makes cardboard taste like fine dining. Fantastic service, crappy \""""Mexican\"""" food. That being said, the first couple of bites were phenomenal - and really only because we went here after one of the EDC nights. Basically, we got back to our rooms at the Hard Rock around 7am...I showered/cleaned up, because there's just no way I can bring myself to sleep without taking a shower after EDC, then we all woke up around 10, cleaned up, checked out, then headed to Pink Tacos around 12:30. The last meal I'd had was breakfast...the previous day (don't judge! who has time to eat or sleep in Vegas anyways??!!?!).",0
2515,"I used to like this place, and now I HATE this place! I would rather be starved instead of going back!\n\nI came here a year ago and the experience was good. This year I came again and it's totally worse than last year. The service was lacking. First of all, we made a reservation through Open Table, and we were very sure it's made because at first, the hostess was able to see it and be able to say my husband's name correctly. So after we got seated down, we notice that the points weren't added to our open table account yet, so my husband asked the hostess about it to see if they have checked us in. But then at that point the hostess said he didn't make any reservation, I guess they deleted it after we got seated, as we couldn't even see the record on our open table account either. The record was there before we got seated, and then disappeared after we were seated. So we didn't get to have out points on open table and it's definitely their fault, not ours.\nAt the end, when we got our check, we forgot to show them the Total Reward card to get the 10% discount, and my credit card has been swiped but I haven't signed yet. So we asked if they can redo the bill for us. They said no because the credit card has been swiped. I got too upset that i didn't argue with them and just paid them and decided not going back. I know that it's not final as long as I don't sign the receipt, they could have voided the one that I haven't signed, and redo the bill with my total reward discount. I know other restaurants would do that as that happened to me in the past. They just needed to void the charge on my card especially I haven't signed. I still give them 15% tip at the end though I am totally dissatisfied with their laziness and wrong doing (including messing up our open table reservation). They don't deserve tip but I gave 15% anyway, as this is the last time they would see me setting foot at this particular restaurant.\n\nI want to note that the service at the one in Town Square is way way way better than this one in Paris Hotel. The Town Square doesn't offer Total Reward discount (of course as it's not in the casino) but their price is lower than the one in paris hotel. Unless you really really really want to look at Bellagio Fountain while eating, otherwise, there is no point to eat at this one at Paris Hotel. You don't really see much of the Bellagio Fountain anyway if you are not sitting at the outside patio.\n\nI am not going back to this Sugar Factory in Paris Hotel ever again. I think it's either the employees lacking training, or the management of this particular one is not doing their job well in training their staff, or maybe the management didn't treat the employees well making them staff not doing their job well. \n\nIf you want to ask me about the food, the food is better at the one in Town Square as well. I always like their red velvet sundae but this time they have changed it to something that tasted so nasty in SF Paris Hotel. While the red velvet sundae at the one in Town Square is still good. I visited both within the same week, so the comparison is a fair one. And yes, I had red velvet sundae twice within the same week but at different location. The one in Town Square is much better than the one in paris hotel!!!!!! At the one in Town Square, the server and hostess are way better, they didn't mess up our open table reservation, greeted us nicely, always have smiley face. The staff (including the management, not just the staff on the floor) at SF Sugar Factory requires a lot of improvement.",0
2516,"I always give places a second chance when I have a not-so-great experience the first time. I figure, hey, everyone has an off day, and the establishment is kind of new, so I should cut them a break.\n\nThe second time here assured me I will not be returning. The service here is really bad. We had the same waitress both times who just doesn't seem to care. I had been in the food service for years awhile back, so I know this is not the way you treat guests.\n\nBoth times I was there, they were out of something that someone ordered. It took a long time for the waitress to get us waters, and even longer to get drinks. The place was not very busy, yet it seemed to take forever for us to get second drinks. We asked for 3 separate checks (1 for me, 1 for another friend, and 1 for my friend and her husband) and the waitress came back with everything on one bill. When we asked her to separate it (again, we were very clear) she gave us 4 separate checks, putting my friend and her husband on different bills. When we asked her to change it, she acted like it was no big deal that she did it wrong in the first place.\n\nThe food here is okay, but the place doesn't look or feel like a British pub. With some other wonderful pubs in town with great service, great food, and great atmosphere, this one just isn't worth it.",0
2517,"This location is awful! 15 minutes into our wait the receptionist began to argue with a patient. The patient was confused on what to do w their paperwork, which is understandable, however not to the receptionist! She responded to her questions, \""""Well you can go somewhere else. You do not have to be here!\"""" As she is saying this a nurse/doctor came out and loudly announced to the waiting room, \""""We apparently have two people that are getting sick in the back so because of them it will be awhile before anyone else will be seen. So because of them your wait will be longer\""""!! \n\nSeriously!!! This made my husband and I uncomfortable and unwelcome. Honestly not the way to approach any situation. Any and all medical facilities need to have compassion and patience this place is far from either!! Oh and my husband and I left after this announcement was made so who knows how bad there bedside manner could have been.",0
2518,"Have been wanting to try this place for a while and finally made it. Arrived early enough on a Saturday where there will still a good selection of donuts. I am a purist and love a good glazed donut so I opted for that. I wanted to try another flavor but to donuts are HUGE and for the price didn't want to throw away a 1/2 eaten donut. The donut itself is very cake-like, the glaze had good flavor and was not overly sweet and the donut was not overly glazed. I took a few bites and left the rest sitting in the car while I ran some errands. A while later I decided to have some more donut and letting it sit in the warm car was the key to donut heaven! After sitting the glaze soaked into the donut and they were both nice and warm.. even the BF agreed it was even better than earlier. I can only imagine what a fresh from the kitchen donut tasted like there, drooling thinking about it.\nThe prices are higher than a DD or KK, but you are paying for local ingredients, locally made product and not some pre-fab box/bag filled with ingredients you cannot pronounce donut. I suggest following them on FB so you can look at yummy donut of the day photos and most importantly know when they have sold out!",1
2519,Small and quaint. Loved this place. I had the most delicious Espresso Macchiato and Heath Bar Fudge. This place is owner operated and he was so warm and welcoming. Would definitely recommend the coffee here. Was such a nice surprise to be welcomed by Todd (owner). He's worked over 2000 days in a row. Interesting story.\nCash only but have an ATM inside.,1
2520,"I wasn't really looking forward to this place, but wow it blew my mind!!  Your best bet for no hassle entry is buy tickets before hand and eat the restaurant.  After dinner the manager escorted us up through the back way and skipped the whole line process.  Our bartender was very generous with his pours of Ciroc Peach!!  The little details that went into this club are crazy-By the way- try to catch deadmau5 here- I thought he would be cheese but he was amazing!!!",1

There is a wait on the weekends so try and get in early on the weekdays!! Their cappuccinos are delicious with some decent tiramsu! Enjoy!!!\n\nTo bad they don't deliver!!!",1
2522,"My girlfriend and I went to Casbah for the first time recently and we both enjoyed our experience.\n\nThe atmosphere is dressy, but the restaurant isn't so formal that it feels stuffy or uncomfortable, which is a welcome change compared to most classy restaurants.  The environment was relaxed, and it was easy to have a quiet conversation throughout the meal.  As for the meal itself, we had a reservation and were promptly seated when we showed up.\n\nOur waiter was courteous and provided good, fast service without being overbearing or constantly hovering, which was quite nice.  For an appetizer, we ordered the cheese tray which was tasty as well as fun and unique.\n\nFollowing the cheese tray, I dined on the cioppino while my girlfriend had the casereccia.  Both dishes were tasty and our seafood was skillfully cooked, particularly the sea bass in my dish which was delicious.\n\nI'd recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to celebrate an occasion or have some good, out of the ordinary food.",1
2523,"Dear Tanzy,\n\nToday you sadly disappointed in the service you provided. I spoke so very highly of your brunch buffet with unlimited mimosas, but sadly things did not go as planned. \n\nLet me start by saying that although the day ended not as planned, all of your staff were quite nice, very friendly, and extremely apologetic. I arrived on time and checked in, and I let the hostess know that my dining companions were running late but I still wanted let them know that I was there since I had made the reservation ( which by the way was cancelled on opentable after I checked in but that is another story).  5 mins later another dining companion arrived and we were seated while we waited for others.  (FYI there was a total of 8 of us including my friend's daughter) Kevin our waiter introduced himself and let us know that he along with another waiter would be taking care of us. Score!  We get to fabulous men to take care of us. We were offered the endless mimosas but were SADLY informed that the brunch buffet that was once before offered was no more and that a new menu for brunch was being introduced.  I was so disappointed as that was the main reason why I had picked Tanzy as I had raved about the brunch buffet and how good it was.  This should have been our queue as to what was to come.\n\nFast forward to around 11:30 and the rest of our party finally arrived. Everyone was happy to so each other and Kevin came by to offer the unlimited mimosas and again let us know that he and another waiter would be taking care of us. Cool. 10 mins later we are ready to order and regretfully our waiters are no where to be found. 20 mins go by and we are still waiting for our waiters so my friend went to the hostess desk  to ask where our waiters were and the hostess herself graciously came over to take our orders. But then we wait, and wait, and wait. We see other tables that came in after we did, get served there meal, eat, and leave. We even asked a party that was across from us, who came in at the same time that we did, if they had even ordered yet as they appeared to be waiting just as long as were were. An hour and 15 mins later ( not kidding) we finally say we are done. I go and look for our waiter and say please cancel our order because we are leaving. \n\nThe manager comes out and apologies and comps our drinks but we were still disappointed. I am not sure what happened today but after speaking your praises   you let me down as well as all my girlfriends. Will I be back? Maybe but it will be awhile. Seriously  Tanzy, you dropped the ball today.\n\nLove, \nEbony\n\nPS Bring back that yummy buffet please!\n\nUpdate 11.12.12: I received a phone call and an email from the General Manager Michael  today. WOW! Thank you for both the call and email. You went above and beyond what I expected. For that I give you 5 stars ( but I won't change the stars on this particular review) But again just wow, thank you!!! See I told you guys that the staff was great!:)",0
2524,"After eating here the first time in Oct, I was really looking forward to the meal.   \n\nI came for lunch and the waiter talked me into trying their buffet lunch.     It had salad, Tom Yum Cabbage Soup, egg soup, egg rolls, tofu and veg, green curry chicken, white and fried rice, tempura veg, pad thai, pad see ew, fried banana, and fruit.      All the delicious thai flavors were dumbed down and muted.   \n\n2nd chance.  Failed!   Went back for dinner to have the Garlic Shrimp that blew my mind last time.   The first time shells were crunchy like shrimp chips, meat was lightly fried, moist, and delicious.   This time dried out and tough, it was so bad I sent it back.   The waiter brought it back out and said it was supposed to be that way.  (Gross!). On a good note the steak tartare was very tasty and delicious!",0
2525,"Probably the WORST buffet in Las Vegas. This place makes the already not-so-great, Vegas buffet in Glendale, CA. look good.\n\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz/vegas-seafood-buffet-glendale#hrid:JnIwxV7PDcIRU7PhAETMrA) \n\nI bet Imperial Palace's buffet (do they have one?) is better. I know the Flamingo buffet is. \n\nThe line to get in is like waiting for Riddler's Revenge in Six Flags Magic Mountain. Too bad it doesn't store as much excitement. Usually people line up for vegas buffets because the food is actually good. This just has a line because they give everyone who stays in the hotel, two for one meal vouchers. I should know, I had one.\n\nWhen you finally get in, you think the line is finally over. WRONG! You enter and you line up to get food. From the PATHETIC sushi selection, to the chow mein makers, to the g0Dd@mn salad bar. lines, lines, LINES! By this point, I am starving. The salad maker wouldn't even help me. There was 1 lady helping 25 people in line. TI, would you please hire more employees? \n\nI barely tried anything in this buffet. I stuck to the American/BBQ section. Their (spare)ribs were dry, the chicken was OK, and I piled up on the collard greens. Honestly, I was so hungry, I was just eating whatever to shut my belly up. The desserts were not memorable. Though I do love me some buffet cookies. \n\nI will not be back.. Unless I get another free voucher.. Which may not be likely because I never want to stay at TI again. It's just a ghetto hotel that needs to be destroyed already. Time for a new skyscraper hotel again.",0

2527,"Was so in the mood for BBQ after a round of golf yesterday! We stopped in for take-out, and I have to tell you I was very excited. I love BBQ and rarely get to indulge since my wife isn't a big fan. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. The restaurant itself is exactly what you'd expect for great BBQ -- picnic tables, lots of paper towels, cool bar off to the side. I really liked the atmosphere. As we waited for our order, I daydreamed about eating lots of messy BBQ with the guys after my next round of golf. The experience from there was less than positive. Even though I was just there ordering take-out, the two guys at the register weren't very helpful and the wait was pretty long for take-out. The real disappointment came when I saw how little food we got for $90. The BBQ was ok, but it's definitely over-priced for what you get. If you go, I'd recommend the wings and the Tri Tip sandwich, but steer clear of the combo plates. If you have kids, have them split a meal and stay away from the kid meals. Only four puny over-cooked and over-breaded chicken nuggets that my kids didn't like -- and they love all chicken nuggets. If you love BBQ and are a big eater, bring extra money and order big.",0
2528,"Worst service I can recall having at a local Las Vegas bar!  Indeed \""""Hendertucky\"""", and they show it. Rude bartenders, awful cocktails that were watered down and just made poorly.

If not for the fact that a friends band was playing there the night we went, I would NEVER go to this place.

The greatness of our new Rome in PHX!\n\nMy analogy may be a stretch (I am, admittedly, a former FS who loved to hit), but a stadium really does set the stage for a fight, whether it is circa 127AD or 2013AD!  The Cardinals Stadium (now sponsored by a notorious degree-manufacturing institution) creates a great setting for a special game or event.  The stadium is easy to navigate in-person, and the fung shui is generally on par.  That is, it has a relatively \""""new\"""" feel, plenty of amenities, and great views throughout most of the stadium.\n\nReady for my complaints?  If not, I am:  the online seating charts and visuals suck.  The upper deck is much higher than the lower/ mid-level seats, and anywhere below the upper deck probably even offers a better view from a slanted angel.  Not knowing this, I incidentally purchased two different sets of tickets (one set for a slanted lower-deck view and another for a side, upper-deck view) for the sum of over $500 only to have to sell two for a $200 loss.\n\nThe stadium is also frigid-cold in the winter.  Considering that they have a dome, they open it (probably wanting to save money instead of heating it) and the Western sun blinds (but warms... and even tans!) those in the upper Eastern side.  So, if you are sitting on the Eastern side (especially in the upper portion), bring sunglasses and/ or a hat.

2539,"I've stayed in some of the worst roach infested seaside motels in California, and this was easily the worst hotel I've ever been in. \n\nIt's Las Vegas, so you really aren't going to spend a ton of time in your room... however, the ability to shower before you go out is sort of a big deal. The shower in our room wouldn't drain and quickly filled up with water. I tried taking a pen and cramming it down the drain to see if I could fix it - I pulled the pen out and a hunk of foul hair and gunk came with it. \n\nThe drain was plugged up with some bitch's entire weave or something... perhaps a dog. We called down to the front desk and were transferred to the wrong department, transferred to a voice mail, and hung up on twice before we were able to get them to send someone out. \n\nThey sent out two maintenance guys to fix it and they spent a half hour blowing air down the drain with a hand pump. This did nothing. They left saying it was still slow, but working a little better. It didn't. All it did was make us late. \n\nIt wasn't just the bathtub malfunction that was a problem... the place was disgusting. There was some sort of small turd near the entry. The vent in the bathroom looked like there was a 1000 year old dead rat inside. The air conditioner sounded like an asthmatic and the busted tile beneath it was covered in dirt. There were all sorts of stains all over the carpet and anything with a surface was covered in layers of old dirt... tops of door frames, mirrors, headboards, etc... \n\nEvery shower curtain ring was broken as well - it felt like some sort of joke - like we were on some sort of reality show... someone just wanted to see us crack.\n\nSadly... the room was 150 per night because we got there on a busy weekend I suppose. Other people online had reported paying in the 30s for their room. I wouldn't have felt right paying 30 any more than I felt right paying 150. I took pictures of everything and brought them downstairs in the morning to the manager who acted relatively nice. I showed her the pictures on my camera and she had me wait to show her head of cleaning staff who looked at them and shrugged at me dismissively.\n\nIn the end, they comped my room. They should've given us tickets to something or gambling money or offered a free night in one of their nicer suites. Had they done anything more than comped the room, I would've tried to be a little more understanding. As it stands though, they did not. \n\nI paid nothing for this room in the end, and it damn near ruined my vacation. It's not worth it at 150, 90, 60, 30 dollars... not even zero. \n\nIf you're a college kid who is happy drinking Bud, your idea of 'ballin' is winning 50 cents in the penny slots, and you are in Vegas to throw televisions through windows and pee in the hallway... you have found your ideal hotel. For a cheap thrill, get in the elevator and ride it as high as it will go - you will fear for your life.\n\nFuck this place.",0
2540,Wish I'd read some previous reviews before I went here. If there isn't an event in the area go someplace else. Food was OK. If you want dinner in an empty warehouse this is the place to go. Service was OK but not great.,0
2541,Over the years i have stay at the MGM many times and never have had a problem..the check-in staff and the dealer to the pit bosses are all pretty nice!!!! \n\nthey send me free room offer all the time...stay 2 nights for free a couple of weeks ago!!! rooms are nice and clean!!!!!,1
2542,"This is a course I keep coming back to time and time again.  I bought their OB Golf Club and have golfed most of their courses, and this is my favorite.  I bring my friends here when they visit, because with the OB card, they also get discounted rates.  And universally, after I ask them at the end of their visit, which of the OB courses they liked the best, it is Eagle Mountain.\n\nEvery time I have played, the condition of the course was immaculate. The advantage of this course, over the We-Ko-Pa courses, is that the carries aren't as bad, and seems to be more forgiving.  It is surrounded by homes, but they are back enough that they do not come into play.\n\nFinally the staff was friendly, and helpful.  The only thing keeping it from 5 stars was that it took a long time to play.  Every time I have played it has been \""""cart path\"""" only, which really adds to the time it takes to play (especially if you are in the opposite rough).\n\nI highly recommend it to everyone, and it should be everyone's list of courses to play.",1
2543,"I made a 6 pm dinner reservation but since we got stuck o the strip, I have to canx the reservation. Bummer, I specifically wanted to be seated by the fall and pond.:(\n\nMy friends and I decided to stop by anyway since we're going to be at Tryst later. Stop by Wynn concierge to see if they have extra VIP pass, the lady at the desk graciously gave me 4 VIP pass, score (Save $20 admission). My friends were happy that I took them to Okada, the place were pretty and romantic. We ended up sitting by the bar and not the table I prefer but it's ok. We accomplished one of our to do's.\n\nLove their Pomegranate Sangria and Strawberry Flirtini. We ordered Seared Tuna Salad (good portion), Red Miso Bouillabaise (small portion), Salmon Sashimi (yummy), California hand roll and I forgot the other order. 4 drinks and dinner damaged $175. Service were great and the experience I shared with gf's are priceless.\n\nWe'll bring Mr for some romantic dinner soon.",1
2544,"I was in Vegas and needed a hair cut.  My hair cut is simple.  Same one Ive had for about 13 yrs.  #1 blended up fade.  Even on top.  SIMPLE!  About 30 different Asian ladies over the years some that dont speak great English can figure this one out. \n\nWhile waiting I noticed the stylist did not stop talking (Thats overrated to me, and kept on talking about working out and fitness)  \n\nI'm up.\n\n I tell her what I want.  Shes SEEMS to understand.   Right away she buzzes me all the way up with a number one.  Thats NOT BLENDED.  I try to slow her down VERY politely and she says \""""You know how long have you been asking for this hairstyle...you know what you want...Let me do what I do.)  Then she proceeds to tell me a story about a guy that left in the middle of the haircut because he kept asking her questions.  Well apparently he was not CRAZY for that.  \n\nShe ends up stepping my hair which is the opposite of what I want.  She asks me where I'm from.  I live in San Leandro which is neighboring Oakland.  I just tell her by Oakland since we are in Vegas. She counters with Wow I did not know White people lived there.  I wanted to counter so many witty things that she would not have appreciated but I did not since she had clippers by my hair  (Side note...The two people you dont mess with...Barbers and Waiters).  \n\nI had not shaven for a few days and she asks me what should I do with the sideburns.  I said leave them I like to take care of them.  Then she clips them WAY high and said oh well I'm gonna do them because you guys never get them straight anyway.  IRONY is SHE MADE THEM SHORT AND SLANTED!\n\nThen she asks if I put product in my hair.  Not often and I would rather not as I was going to run after this and shower.  She goes well its what I do and puts the equivalent of a quart of Pennzoil on my jacked up head and gives me the ultimate DB fohawk.  I almost kicked my own A**.\n\nShe then proceeded to tell me about her \""""shoulder workout\"""".  She also decided to educate me about fitness.  (Side note....Not to be mean but she is not a certified trainer by any means or equipped to drop this knowledge)  Double side note....I am...I'm a fit PE TEACHER!!!!!!).....But I just let her talk and I tried to be thankful I was almost done.  \n\nI hate that this is my first Yelp review and plan to do 4 positives to even out this one but three weeks later I just looked at my hair and its growing out even worse.  Sorry miss Supercuts lady. Maybe it was just a bad day for ya but we did not click.  I also still tipped her 10 bucks but would not return.",0
2545,"Findlay Honda used to be a great place to buy a car they treated you like a person not a sale. Definitely can't say that now. Started the process of buying a car Friday, went back twice couldn't make a deal. They the next day and today trying to make a deal, they asked what they could do to make it happen. We agreed on 21500 out the door, so I went to sign the paperwork and when I got there I discovered that 21.5 did not include the $1800 plus interest. When it was pointed out the manager Don got involved and began to treat me like I was stupid and insinuated that only I was not trying to pay interest but that I had wasted his time and his employees in the service departments time because they had to wash the car. He said he wasted money to pay them. He was extremely rude and I know I will never do business with them again and would not recommend going there. I have never been more pissed at a car dealership and I feel like I was lied to and treated like crap.",0
2546,"there's this commercial. order a medium or larger drink and get an egg and cheese english muffin for $.99. seemed like a good deal to me, and i was hungry this morning. besides, dunkin' has been making great strides in quality and service, right? that's what the marketing would have you believe anyway. so i order from the drive thru and pay $3.15 for a medium iced coffee and the aforementioned egg and cheese english muffin. service is swift. i drive away, ready to dig into my sandwich on the parking lot that is the 101. that's when things get ugly. my sandwich is cold. like, you can feel how cold it is through the paper bag. i can't eat it, mainly because i'm afraid it will sicken me in some way... i don't screw around with egg. and yes, i'm still hungry. \n\nso, sorry dunkin', your marketing gal is a genius, but this store did not deliver. shame on me for believing that silly marketing ploy.",0
2547,"Food Is good. Service is slow. Large salads and sandwiches  with plentiful sides. Burger was cook ed as ordered. Their special sauce is killer good. Peppery spicy alone but on the burger is fantastic.  Cuban sandwich is large and filling and delicious. Brownie Ala mode is enough for two, maybe three. Order dessert only if you are not pressed for time. Took over 30 min to get dessert menu, order and stated eating.  It will take 1 hour for entree and another for dessert. Hard to get into a lunch hour.",1
2548,"While I'm starting low because my experience hasn't been that great, I'm still willing to come back and try it again. \n\nWalking in the decor is modern hip diner with wood flooring, dark cabinetry, paper fixtures, and an appeasing green/orange/brown color scheme. I didn't have to wait as I went straight to the bar to sit. The noise level is a little loud with techno type music playing. This is a little random but the silverware was bulky and hard to use. \n\nI ordered 1 scrambled egg. Side of hash browns. Soyrizo. Tortilla. Coffee. The total was $11.37. The egg was cooked well and the hash browns was a healthy portion. However, both were very bland. I didn't even eat the soyrizo as the spices gave it a horrible taste, so I didn't touch it past the first bite. I'm spoiled by the Trader Joes soyrizo I think. The coffee was also bland, but I drank it because I needed my caffeine. I was never offered a refill or top off. The bartender was prompt enough but no personality. Never asked how everything was etc. \n\nI've heard so many good things about this place, so I was disappointed. Next time I will try those pancakes everyone talks about, and partake of the bar menu.",0
2549,"This place is all about the 'upsell'.  Once they get you in the door with their low memberships they start pumping their 'supplements' and personal training, which is their main revenue stream.  You have to be very assertive with them and tell them to back off, otherwise they will just keep coming after you to get you to buy their products and services.  This is the most aggressive gym I have ever been to in terms of their constant and relentless upsell efforts.  It can be a real turn off.",0
2550,Another stay at the awesome Aria and I was even more impressed than the first time. Their customer service is top notch and every single one of my needs and wants were met. You can tell their staff has a lot of customer service training and they deliver to their guests. Amazing!,1
2551,"serendipity.  who hasn't seen the cheesy romantic comedy? either way, i'd heard about the ice cream shop/cafe through the movie and several shows on the food network.  i haven't gotten the chance to hit it up in NY yet, so i was stoked to find out that they had a location in vegas! \n\nsince the bf and i were there already, we decided to give it a try.  and of course we had their famous frozen hot chocolate\n\nboth of our first sips were like \""""eh\"""" but as we kept drinking it (i mean, who wouldn't? i paid 10 bucks for this thing.  i'm gonna finish it) it tasted better and better.  i gotta say, the little chocolate shavings were a nice little treat.  by the time we got to the bottom of the bowl, my bf and i were fighting over them.  \n\ni'm glad i tried it and it was pretty tasty, but i would much rather get my chocolate br blast from baskin robins for a third of the price that tastes just as yummy",1
2552,"$10.76 for a panini is a little expensive, if I may say...I was expecting the sandwich to blow my taste buds for that price.The wait to receive my sandwich was pretty long. I  figured since they were prepping it to order it was ideal for them to take a while; yet, how long does it take to grill up some vegetables and pressed them inside a sandwich with cheese? The wait  (10 minutes) + price ($10.76) + flavor (tart due to improper preparation/cooking of eggplant) + seasoning (bland) + no spread (dry) =/= did not equate to the price value I had purchased it for. I recommend heading over to another location to grab some grub. If you're going to spend around $10 or so, might as well go to a restaurant or head over to Earl of Sandwiches if you are truly in the mood for some delicious sandwiches.",0
2553,"This sports bar is the king of the lunch special. Good choices and good prices. My only complaint is that the service is slow. If you go for lunch expect your whole lunch hour to be sapped. But, the food is tasty, the drinks are cold, and the price is right.",1
2554,"Poor service, indifferently cleaned food, and weak seasoning.  The menu also didn't match the food actually served, so I got to eat pork for the first time since my conversion 20 years ago.  \nThey were FAR from apologetic. We will not be back.",0
2555,"I'll trade you one food city for one Trader Joes... I wish it worked that way!  My only gripe with TJ's is that there isn't one in old town.   I work in Tempe, so I manage to hit this one on my way home every once in a while.  TJ's is always busy, but the service is never lacking. TJ's employees are pretty knowledgeable about their wine selection, and have helped me find some great wines for super cheap.   My favorite thing about TJ's is they have a ton of vegetarian options and a rockin selection of hummus and dips!  As much as I love TJ's, the main downfall is that I can't go there for all my grocery needs, their produce section and \""""staple\"""" items are pretty limited.",1
2556,"If there was a possible zero, this place would get it. But, Yelp felt the need that all business deserve pity stars. \n\nFrom upon entering, we're greeted by an Asian fellow with glasses. There were two-three tables open for 10...he reluctantly seated us and was about to put us on a waiting list. If not mentioned, we would have wasted our time. \n\nSoup is less than mediocre, broth was bland and constumer service was blatantly disrespectful. We asked multiple times for simple sides like onion, and waiters would not acknowledge our requests. \n\nJust to top off the cake, there was curly hair in my #10 soup. The cashier was apologetic, but not by nature. She looked at my wife and I, trying to find out if the hair belong to one of us. The hair was curly and short, possibly armpit hair. For her to stare up and down at us, it was very offensive, we did not plan to eat someone else's pubes. For a restaurant that cries it is the number 1 soup restaurant, they sure treat us like we are the last people to come back.",0
2557,"Yes, this is, indeed, the best market in the city.  The only way you could do better is to go to a farm stand at a farm and/or pick your own.  This is like the convention of the best and most well known and most local farmers there are in the area.  In supplement, some of the best stuff is brought in from California  So take your pick: super local direct from your farmers, or semi-local but exotic and fresh and brought to you with love and care by Kerry.",1
2558,"Food was ok. It wasn't bad, just nothing great. Its like the place tries too hard. They walk you in through the kitchen (cute, but gimmicky). The place is overfilled with photos and artwork. They are nice photos, but its distracting almost on purpose. As if the food is not the real star of the show. It shows in the flavors. The service is great but again just too over the top with a way too long intro about every single portion of he menu. My server lost me towards the end. He was very attentive at first with his long spiel but then we barely saw him. All in all, it was ok. More focus on food and flavors and less on cliche. Its a standard italian restaurant for a standard meal. Nothing to remember",0
2559,"I can't wait to visit my parents in Vegas again. Why? Because I am missing the burger and fries from this place. WOW just doesn't explain how delicious this place is.\n\nThe menu is very unique, balsamic reduction with feta cheese and onions on fries. But let me say that the flavors are well on spot. There unusual toppings are a must have, someone has been doing there homework in flavor town.\n\nThe decor is very cool, the bathrooms are chalkboard walls so you can leave a message for the next patron. There are some fun shirts hanging on the wall as well. The service was fast and friendly. I can see why my parents have this place as a staple. And since the burgers are so small, you get to try different flavors!\n\nIts located next to a strip mall so parking is in a lot. There is a drive thru, but it can get REALLY backed up during dinner.",1
2560,"I'm very indecisive on what to eat so I ended up here because they serve all kinds of Mediterranean food. We started off with calamari and Athens fries. I like both but calamari was a tad over cooked. For our entrees we ordered the kabob trio of chicken, lamb, and beef and angel hair bolognese. My son settled for chicken strips and fries. Everything came out almost at the same time so we scuffed down the calamari to make space on the table. food was good and huge portions. Definitely bring your appetite. I really wanted dessert but there was no way. I was too full. From hostess, waitress and busser. It was all around friendly service and deliciously huge portions of food.",1
2561,Went to Madison's for a beer after work. Beer is the coldest on the West Island. Service excellent. The TV's within the bar are not overwelming like some other places. Have not had the food in the resturant  but the bar food OK.  Would recommend to anyone wanting to have a cold beer and relax after work.,1
2562,"Like much in Vegas, pretty on the outside, but no substance.\n\nAte here twice on a recent business trip. The space, redecorated from its previous goofy pseudo-diner style, is quite nice, masculine and casual yet well-appointed, with a classy bar and the now-ubiquitious but still pretty old style light bulbs. Sat at the bar and had friendly and attentive service. \n\nThe breakfast was standard - eggs/toast/sausage/potatoes were like \""""diner plus\"""" with a flavorful pepper mixed in with the potatoes and thick texas style toast. Fine. The major disappointment was dinner. I went in craving something just barely healthy (after a few days in Vegas I was desperate for a vegetable) and the main recommended entree at Citizens is a chicken/brocolli/potato plate that looked great. Unfortunately the execution was inexcusably poor, especially for a \""""signature\"""" dish. The chicken was flavorless and dry, even with the skin left on. Broccoli rabe was undercooked and also flavorless, and the potato quarters were the least cooked of all, with a full half of them too hard to even cut with a fork, and inedible. Everything sat in a plate full of broth, perhaps that's in an attempt to disguize the dryness and blandless of the food, but even the broth doesn't help. Chow in San Francisco does this chicken/brussel sprouts/mashed potato dish that's just bursting with flavor and juiciness, and it's like 12 bucks. This $25 plate was just sad and pointless. Again, like so much in Vegas in general, it's an opportunity to spend twice as much on something half as good.",0
2563,"I have lived here for almost five years now. At first it was great, all my neighbors were mostly military from nellis. My first year living here some Air Force guy hit my car then knocked on all the doors in our building to find me to pay for it. However after three years it started to decline a lot and I don't see that happening now with the people living here. Things just got ghetto and I'm glad that I'm a firm believer in carrying a firearm at all times. Plus the two airforce guys down stairs complain about our music in 5 in the afternoon. Really? I can under stand if it was like 9pm or later and if it was from our large speakers instead of our tiny Bluetooth speakers that we use with our phones. Lol. Okay, Let's get down to the pros and cons of the place. \n\nPRO:\n1. It's gated apartment complex which adds a little bit of security. \n2. The repair guys respond within 48hours or so. Not bad. \n3. Two pools with a bar area for parties and a nice spot to relax with a gas fire place. \n4. A small gym\n5. Gas grills located around the complex\n6. Looks nice from the outside. \n7. Has stands with doggie bags around the grassy areas\n8. close to smiths, Home Depot, dottys, jack in the box, in and out, costco isn't too far away, and a few parks not that far away as well. \n9. Dinner party's and ice cream parties hosted and paid for by the complex. \n\nCON:\n1. Neighbors are getting very ghetto and they don't look after their kids. They run around every where and I'm scared I might run a kid over one day. We had a baby shower at the pool and some random guy tried to get into a fight with us. Basically a lot of rude people live here now. \n2. The repair guys are lazy to do anything major in the repairs aspect and just mark it off telling you don't worry it's fine we'll make sure your not charged for it. The building is just settling. I now live with a giant crack across my wall that looks like it's going to come down. \n3. The main pool looks kind of gross because it hasn't been scrubbed clean in a long time. The second pool that my family and friends that come over has named the ghetto pool is disgusting. Trash is every where there, every time I walk my dog I see empty beer bottles and 40's lol\n4. The gym has most things but is very limited on their equipment. Wished it had better machines for core workouts. \n5. Every time I renew my lease the price gets higher and higher. \n6. No one picks up after their dog so their is dog **** every where even though you have doggie bag place around the place for free. \n7. Had a very rude encounter with one of the office managers. I've been using the same phone number to contact the office for five years every month to get a quote on my rent and water bill. one day it wasn't working. so I went into the office and ask if the number has changed and the manager said no. So I showed her the phone number, she was stubborn, and kept telling me no that's not our number then gave me a look that basically said your stupid. Few weeks latter I called using the same number I have been using and like magic it worked and I still use that same number to call the office when I need it. That was just very shady. \n\nMy recommendation is find some where else to live first. I know I am looking for some place a little nicer to live now. This place was just a really nice place to live in the beginning but has declined a lot. You do see a lot of eviction stickers on doors too lol.",0
2564,"We've loved the classes we've taken there.  We started taking classes before our wedding over a year ago, and we got hooked.

There's so much more space now, and more class offerings at a variety of levels.  We started taking one of the swing courses, and the instructor is outstanding and makes the class enjoyable.

My understanding of froyo is there are different grades.  The good places have the good quality yogurt.  This was not good quality yogurt and I've had my share of froyo.  The price reflected all the more expensive places we've been to so I can't even justify that \""""it's at least cheaper to come here.\""""  In fact, I think it's even more expensive.  We spent close to $5 and for that price, at other locations with better yorgurt, I've gotten a lot more bang for my buck.\n\nThis is a huge disappointment for us.  We love froyo.  We know froyo.  We were hardly impressed.  I wish I could support this local establishment but I don't think we'll be coming here very often.\n\nPlus, I overheard the cashier (owner?) talk to the next customer in line about some sort of rewards program, which was never offered to me.  I must have been a terrible customer or something.",0

All I had on my trip was a cup of coffee but I would like to come back for a speciality drink or sandwich. I know my time was limited here but it had a very positive vibe, similar to the Phoenix classic The Willow House.

2567,Dj shai was an amazing dj at my Wedding.\n\nI was nervous having a dj for such a small wedding (30ish people) inside dal toro restaurant Inside the palazzo. But I'm so glad I did! He kept the night going PERFECT! \n\nHe met with us before to make sure to cater the service around our preferences! He seemed very passionate and super knowledgable about how the night should go when I was clueless!.\n\nDj shai was AMAZING without him my wedding would not have been half as good as it was.,1
2568,The salads looked like it was directly out of a bag. The service was lacking in an almost empty restaurant. My girlfriends Shrimp Scampi was good but the Maryland Crab cakes weren't. \nYou know it's bad when you walk out see Panda Express and know you would have had a better experience there.,0
2569,"Didn't eat but was lured by an impressive Tequila lineup.  They had our favorite (Casa Nobles Anejo).  But the bartenders were pretty poor at mixing a good margarita.  I asked for a Grand Marnier float and he poured it in the shaker after the tequila.  The mixes they used were mediocre at best.  The drinks were  $14, similar ones would hit $18-$20 at the \""""finer\"""" bars.  Kind of sad to have really good tequila but not the bar talent, although given the appearance of the place as a basic taco joint, I didn't expect much.",0
2570,"Definitely over priced! Especially for the 3 tacos for $10+? We had 9 orders of it one time and it took an hour to make... We were getting very anxious and annoyed. When we told our server we wanted to cancel our order she finally went to the back to check and brought it out. SMH. An order of tacos comes with 3 tacos, rice, and black beans...\n\nIt does the trick if you're stranded in Vegas and can't find any tacos if you're craving some. Interesting name too. Can't say anything else about restaurant since we did a to go order.",0
2571,"This is one of my least favorite music venues in Phoenix.  I have sat in many different areas and sections, and all are lackluster.  The sound is hit or miss depending on the concert and where you sit.  The lawn seats are usually the only affordable option, unless I just love the band playing.  We saw Train perform there a few months ago.  I thought I had bought some great seats because they were over $40 each, but when we arrived we weren't even in the lower section of seats.  Those seats were over $80!!  Outrageous!!  I can't stand sitting in the lawn at this venue because so many idiots smoke pot while sitting out there and you are forced to smell that disgusting smell for hours on end.  The beer and food are insanely expensive and very low quality.",0
2572,"Having dinner at Studio B buffet.  For $40 a person, I am very disappointed.  There's a tiny section for sushi (one plate and some rolls) and there are only 2-3 kinds.  The Osso Bucco is as hard as leather.  Pad Thai too spicy.  Crab legs are very thin and hardly have any meat.  Oysters and shrimp are ok.  One Plus is that beer and wine are included.  I just don't think the price is worth it.  Will definitely not be back.",0
2573,"Normally if a place isn't good I wouldn't do a review but I will for Thai Taste because Im surprised at how bad it was! Ive always heard good things about this place. \n\nI ordered Chicken Pad See Ew and they gave me complimentary fried shrimp/egg roll things. I was hungry so I was ready to dive into my food but, it just wasn't good!\n\nThe chicken looked poor in quality and it had an odd smell. I couldn't help but to think of dirty mop water the whole time I attempted to eat it. On top of not being able to finish it my stomach turned and I had heartburn for the rest of the night. I will not order take out again; first & last time for me!",0
2574,"I've been to this place and it'snot exactly my favourite. The food's rotton in the refectory. When ever you ask for a roll w sausage or bacon etc you have to ask for the butter as the butter is not in the prepared roll. They give you a wee scabby plastic knife to butter the roll with as well. In the refectory you are not allowed to take a packed lunch, when i first heard that I thought wtf? If you want decent lunch advice go home then return afterwards.",0
2575,"Love this place, eat here a least once a week.  Have brought many of our friends and neighbors, they also love Las Cazuelas, food is great, the margaritas are fabulous and if you tell them on the rocks light ice they do it, also senior discount of 10%, service can be slow at times because they are usually packed.

All the performers seemed to so enjoy themselves as did the audience....very nice venue...not really any bad tables.\nFood/drinks are very reasonably priced and good!\nThey also have a varied lineup of shows....something for everyone.

Our friends were a few parties ahead of us and yea it sucks that people cut to meet up with their friends, but whatever it happens and you do it, I do it and yep, that's what we were doing.  And then, a bouncer stopped us saying \""""you have to wait like everyone else.\""""  okay, fine, we have to wait.  AND THEN, this bitch ass bouncer lets people cut for the party in front of us.....??????  thanks...for that?  later on that night i found out that one of my friends was not let in because the bouncer didn't believe her id was her.  it wasn't a fake id and the reason why they wouldnt let her in was because she said the wrong weight as written on the id.  ARE YOU SERIOUS?? its freaking vegas, she's with a bunch of girls and who really says their correct weight on their id??  and what bouncer really looks at the id anyways.  ugh i hated the bouncers there, thought they were so tough cuz they were working for the it spot in vegas.\n\nthe music sucked!!!!!!  for being one of the most popular clubs in vegas, i thought they would have played more hip hop, less house/trance.  it was like weird remixes if they did play hip hop, so no thanks!\n\nokay ill give credit to how big this place is.  it was nice that it had a spacious outdoors and how they had gambling tables within the club.  i liked how it had a lot of seating area as well.  everyone kept on saying, it was the nicest pace, but honestly i think its only the nicest because its one of the newest clubs....give it like another year....",0
2579,"Small buffet...  It had nacho/taco station, cold cut sandwich station, cold crab claws (not legs), prime rib, dinner sausage, small salad bar, 1 type of soup, fried chicken, rice (white and fried), dessert island, fish, and a few other things.  It was dingy and old.  The wait staff was nice.  $13.99 per person.  My dad like the prime rib; personally, nothing stood out.",0
2580,"Just got back from a massage and decided to let everybody know what a great massage therapist we have in town. Located right by Freedom Park it is very convenient for me. The inside is very relaxing and calm. There is an acupuncturist in the house, so maybe next time i will schedule a session with him too. Ok now about a massage, since that's what counts more then anything, right?\nI came because my neck was hurting and Olena did a great job, she did go deep and found where the problem was, not like some therapist that just touch your skin. She gave me a full body massage i think i fell asleep somewhere in the middle of it melting into the soft table. Now i feel fabulous, neck feels better, and my body is like new. Cant wait to go back.  Give her try.",1
2581,"My husband had the steak sandwich and said it was good.  I tasted his garlic fries and they did,t have much flavor,but most of all were not real hot and not crispy,\nJust a kind of hardness.  Nothing to look at or tempt me to eat more.\nI had the Kobe burger and will never have another. It looked hard and dark and was not juicy at all.  Maybe a burger  really should have some fat or they don't know what they are\ndoing.  I never use ketchup, but had to drown this burger in it for some flavor.  Yuk!\nI so wish I would have sent it back, but our server was so nice.  This place is over priced and could take a lesson from Cheesecake Factory where everything is consistently GOOD.     Thank God we had a birthday coupon and got a break on the bill.  Free chocolate cake that was not moist except for the frosting.  Will never go back.    We don't care about the beer.",0
2582,I feel I can't be 100% fair since I did not order the pizza or a regular entree but what I did order was a disappointment so that is what I am judging here.  \n\nThe minestrone cup of soup was not bad but nothing special and my side salad was inedible due to the ocean of balsamic vinegar that was poured onto it.  The croutons were so soaked they were black.  I had to ask the waitress to please take it off our bill.\n\nMy parents were satisfied with their eggplant parm plate and chicken parm hero but I wouldn't think a bowl of soup and a salad would be that difficult to get right.\n\nFrom what I saw the pizza looked like pizza hut or dominoes style not real pizza...\n\nI don't think I would go back here.,0

The man who answered my call was very polite, came within the hour, did a good deal of work taking apart drains and the dishwasher to figure out the problem....so far, so good.\n\nHe first said my problem was due to the Cascade pacs not dissolving properly, which can cause back-up.  That sounds reasonable.  Then he said it was a dishwasher malfunction. Then he thought he got the machine working and went back to original theory.\n\nHe first quoted under $100, then when he was finished it was $150. I understand that being that he took apart quite a bit in the kitchen. I went to write the check and he asks to have it made out to his name...which isn't Freddy (so is that going to him or the company...is this legit?) and then he asks for cash instead.  What company does business cash only?  He then informs me he has to cash the check at my bank because he's \""""in between banks\"""" (hmmm???). He calls me from the bank and says he needs an alternate form of payment because he can't cash the check at my bank since he's not a member there.  I don't know of any bank that will let you cash a check there unless you have an account with them.  This was a 2 hour ordeal that did not seem to be good business practice.\n\nHe says he will email the invoice.\nTried using the dishwasher today and it is still flashing \""""intake drain\"""" and not going through the cycle since the water is stuck in the bottom of the dishwasher....meaning it's not fixed.",0
2584,"My fianc\u00e9 and I are relatively new to the area and wanted to try a local place. We are not very familiar with Vietnamese food, but after reading multiple good reviews, we decided to try Saigon Kitchen. We were not disappointed!\n\nIt appears the place typically serves takeout, but we were greeted warmly and invited to stay. The woman helping us asked if we were familiar with Vietnamese food, and when we told her 'no,' proceeded to walk us through the menu and answer questions. \n\nWe settled on a mixture of some of their most popular dishes, including spring rolls, bahm mi, pho, and an egg noodle stir-fry. It was a ton of food and it was all delicious! Out total bill was $26, and we had food left over to take home!\n\nAs somebody that is not an expert in Vietnamese food, I can't really compare it to others, but I will tell you that this place will now be a regular spot for my fianc\u00e9 and I. Very enjoyable, nicely priced, and highly recommended!",1

I was here with my family (wife and two kids), and the food was decent...except for my daughter's Taco Salad \""""with Chicken.\""""  It was ice cold and there was no chicken.  It was so bad that I asked for it to be removed from our bill, and said we would order dessert to make up for that.  The waiter never removed it from my bill, said he couldn't do it, and had to ask the manager.\n\nThe manager was perhaps the WORST manager I've ever dealt with.  She acknowledged the issues with the food but said she would only take half off.  I went back and and forth with her politely, and she only refunded the entire amount after the waiter voluntarily went back to her AGAIN.  I literally saw her walk by our table SHAKING HER HEAD.  I guess \""""how dare a guest not like the food\"""" was something she never dealt with before.\n\nThis experience soured me enough to never go back to this restaurant, and I'm not sure I'll stay at the South Point again.\n\nIf you don't have issues with your food, it's okay.

2586,"This review is for the flooring department, only.\n\nWe are looking to change out the carpeting in our entire house.  This is a big project and considering that we had our current house built new 10 years ago (carpeting was included) and we came from an apartment with carpeting in only a few rooms we are complete novices when it comes to carpeting.  We went to Home Depot knowing that they have a large selection of carpeting choices and they were offering a interest-free promotion that was interesting.  We also went there for, what we hoped would be, knowledgeable sales staff to assist us with the \""""process\"""".  Well, we were right about the choices, but completely wrong about the knowledgeable sales staff.  The one girl working in this department was able to tell us what the ordering, measuring, and installation process is and she also seemed gleeful about warning us about the number of hidden charges, but her depth of knowledge shallowly ended there.  We asked her for advice and even admitted that we were completely unsure as to which carpets were best for our home, but she offered no guidance whatsoever. \n\nWe wandered around aimlessly for about approx 30 minutes when a different sales associated noticed that we looked lost and offered to help...granted, he said that he knew NOTHING about carpeting, but at least he cared enough to help.\n\nFinally, we decided to leave.  We then turned to Yelp for reviews on local flooring specialist and ended up at locally-owned flooring store where they were extremely knowledgeable, very helpful, and has all-inclusive pricing that beats HD!",0
2587,"I had read about this locally-owned business in the Ahwatukee-Foothills News and then noticed a coupon in the mail.  We were having a party in a few weeks and the carpets were a mess, not to mention the three areas that had been snagged/ripped from when our Puggle was a puppy.  It was perfect timing to give a new company a try.\n\nI called and scheduled an appointment for carpet cleaning and repair for the three spots.  The woman on the phone was kind and helpful.  She answered all of my questions and scheduled my appointment.\n\nWhen the man arrived to clean the carpets, he was very friendly, knowledgeable, and easy-going. He even went into my attic to get the extra carpet for the repairs!  He worked quickly and even put up plastic guards to protect the corners of the furniture and walls so that the hose didn't leave any marks from being dragged through the house.  And he had little booties on his feet (OK, more like big booties) so that his shoes didn't get the floors dirty.\n\nTwo things to be aware of.  1 - This time, my carpets did take a little longer to try because I didn't go with the company that has the fast-drying chemicals.  This is the organic stuff, no short cuts here, but a much better feeling than having chemicals under your feet!  2 - No credit cards accepted.  Check or cash.  No biggie, as long as you have your checkbook on had.\n\nOverall, I was very impressed with the quality of service and quality of work that I received from Barefoot Organic.  Plus, all for a very reasonable price!  I will be sure to use them again and highly recommend them for your carpet cleaning or repair needs.",1
2588,"Hands down, the BEST hotel I have stayed in in Vegas. Possibly anywhere. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.\n\nFirst, the only parking is complimentary valet parking. Which is awesome. And makes you feel pretty legit, especially when you're not swanky enough to usually valet park your car. \n\nThe girl that checked us in was very nice and very helpful. She made light conversation with us and was very polite. All of the staff that we came in contact with were the same way. And I really appreciated when we came in late one night, that they were checking everyone's room keys before they could get on the elevators. \n\nThe hotel lobby was beautiful and well-kept. I really appreciated that there wasn't a casino attached because it made everything look that much classier and nicer. \n\nWe just got the standard room but it was HUGE. King-sized bed, more closets than I have in my house, a kitchenette with a sink, mini-fridge, toaster, etc., and a sitting area with a couch and two chairs. And the BATHROOM. I have never in my life seen a bigger hotel room bathroom. A shower that could have easily fit ten people, a walled off area for the toilet, double sinks, a HUGE jetted tub, and a TV IN THE MIRROR. I felt like a queen. \n\nThe only problem we had was the reception on the TV. About every three minutes, the picture would freeze and would stay that way for another minute or two. But when you're in Vegas, you don't spend much time laying around watching TV, so it wasn't a huge deal. \n\nI fully plan on returning to this hotel whenever I'm in Vegas. And I HIGHLY recommend staying here.",1
2589,It was an ok price for the food. The food has a good taste. I ordered the Chicken Wings and it was soooo gooooooood. If you check in you get a free egg roll. I gave this place a 4 star because they gave me a veggie egg roll.,1
2590,"Decided to eat here for breakfast before we made our way back to Los Angeles. \n\nEXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!\n\nNever going to eat here again and never going to recommend anyone I know to eat here. \n\nInitially, the price you pay ($47.00 for 2) didn't seem too bad. You expect it to be that price. It's a buffet right? When you take your first lap around the buffet you'll notice how dismal the selections are. There's breakfast cereal... BREAKFAST CEREAL!!! I just paid $23 to have fruit loops?!? Then that's when you realize the price is ridiculous. \n\nIf you continue on you'll notice each station has some sort of an egg dish. Lobster frittata, scrambled eggs, egg white only, eggs benedict, and then an omelet station?!? Who can eat so many eggs and how lazy do you have to be that you can't come up with any other dish other than plain egg whites?!?\n\nAfter bypassing the numerous egg dishes and the prepared cereal bowls of frosted flakes and fruit loops, I went looking for the lox and bagels. I find the station and a line of people thinking that maybe the lox are really good. I remember them being pretty good so I make my way over to the line. I get to the line only to find that people are waiting for the staff to put more lox out. The woman in front of me says that she's been back and forth from her table several times hoping that they had replaced the lox. She went on to say she's been waiting for at least 40 minutes. 40 MINUTES!!! We ask the man behind the glass to put more out and all he says is \""""more coming.\"""" Yes we know, but WHEN?!?\n\nThis is where I decided to tell my wife to finish her plate and to stop eating because we were going to wait 45 minutes at our table drinking only our coffee and juice and drive off to go have breakfast elsewhere.\n\nSeriously people...

I can't help but notice the lack of haughtiness.  This is a milder version of swank.

Show is only a few days old so I'll try not to be overly critical but I've seen way better and I feel like they put a lot of money into a show that is nothing more than a glorified cover band musical. The lead guy in the show had a good voice, other than that everyone else struggled or was just not very good.\n\nThe first half of the show kind of dragged on a bit but ended with a cool finale. They take a 7 minute intermission and the second half of the show was improved but left much to be desired. They seemed confused as to whether they wanted to play to the crowd or not... more crowd involvement would have been better for this type of show.\n\nQuite a few really funny spots in the show but it just didn't feel like it was put together well. Hopefully they can improve on it. With so many great cover bands in Vegas that you can hear the same music and more, it may be hard for them to compete.",0
2596,"Worst shipping experience of my life!  I cannot talk about the quality/flavor of the cupcakes themselves mostly because they never showed up!  I purchased cupcakes through the site to be shipped for a birthday party.  I paid hefty for 2 day shipping and placed the order 2 weeks in advance to make sure they arrived in time for the birthday.  The day of the party...no cupcakes!  How humiliating to have no cake at a birthday!  Not to mention the costs associated with the whole mess.  I called sas and was greated by a friendly staffer who took my information and told me the owner would call me back.  The next day still no call so I called them back.  I get the same girl on the other end, who says that the owner emailed me.  HOW RUDE! You can't even call me.  I check my email and don't see the response (who knows if she ever really sent it) and I call back to see what the email said.  I guess their site says \""""ship date\"""" and not \""""delivery date\""""- so when I put in the date I was expecting to get the cupcakes I was actually placing an order for them to leave their store that day.  How confussing!  So it's the customers responsibility to know how long it takes for them to make the cupcakes and ship them out, and to take that into account when placing an order for them and wanting them on a certain date.  I am not sure how this is even possible given this is their business, not mine.  How am I supposed to know this as a customer?  Not to mention the additional shipping I paid and how long before the need date I placed the order.  Long story short, I never got to talk to the owner who relayed all of her information through the friendly staffer.  The owner can't even personally contact upset costumers which led me no choice but to contact my credit card to file a dispute.  Never again!  Happy closure Sas.",0

I had to find a place online because I was coming from another state so I was recommended to live in a certain apartment from one of the employees.

I could hear cars all day and night and people outside my window all the time. I could hear my neighbor snoring every single night so don't count on having thick walls. After a few months of getting no sleep I finally begged management to let me move somewhere else but the only option I was given was to move to another apartment in the same complex for a $200 transfer fee. Now I live in an apartment that smells like pee. My clothes smell and I have tried to febreez my carpet but that does not work either. Management has been horrible through out this entire experience especially Christina, Ana, and Bridget is the ultimate worst. Bridget claims she is the assistant manager but I have never been treated with such disrespect before. The pools are never clean either so do not trust the pictures you see. I have already had 3 notices on my door as well as police officers knocking on my door due to burglaries and one child kidnapping so this is definitely not a safe place to live.

The staff were all very friendly and made sure our orders were taken as soon as we were ready, even to the point that different waitresses were asking to make sure we had coffee on the way.\nThe coffee's great and I was impressed with raw sugar on each table. \n\nThe menu is small [literally] and I ordered the cheese omelette [cheddar] with mushrooms and hash browns. The hash browns were ridiculously oily. They would have been tastier without so much grease. The omelette was mediocre and I could have made the same in my own kitchen.  The whole wheat toast was probably the best part of the meal, and the jam tasted homemade and flavourful. I am not used to really greasy food like I was served [nor did I expect it] and therefore could not get through half my breakfast before my stomach started aching. \n\nThe jist?

While Van Morrison's song title got me in the door for lunch, I didn't expect anything other than standard Southern fried fare.

For an expat Southerner now living on the West Coast, this oversizing isn't necessarily a good thing. \n\nSurprise! This place got it right. \n\nI was served a bit buttery biscuit as an appetizer that came with blackberry jam and tupelo honey, but I could actually taste the fruit instead of just sugary jelly. I opted for the veggie plate. The black eyed peas had a nice kick and weren't just boiled bland mush, the brussels sprouts were tender, and the highlight--the fried okra was lightly breaded, allowing the full taste to come through.

2611,"The food here is good, but wasn't exactly what I was expecting. Everything was was good quality and well prepared (and fast!) and the price was very reasonable. My wife and I both ordered the 1/4 rotisserie chicken (white) which came with cornbread and two sides. I got the baked beans and the special: spicy mac & cheese. The first thing I tried was the cornbread, and found it had jalape\u00f1os and whole kernels of corn baked in. I know some people really like the whole corn in the cornbread thing, but I'd rather keep my breads and vegetables separate. Next up was the spicy mac & cheese. I love mac & cheese, and I've become a big fan of having a bit of hot sauce added to give it some kick, so I was really excited about this. It certainly had the spicy; it had lots of jalape\u00f1os mixed in and was quite hot. What it was lacking was the cheese. There was no creaminess to it at all. The baked beans, however, were very good. They also had jalape\u00f1os mixed in (are you sensing a theme here?), but only had a subtle kick which was balanced with a slightly sweet tangy sauce. As for the chicken, the flavor was excellent but most of the breast was pretty dry. The wing, on the other hand, was quite juicy. If you're looking for really moist chicken you might have better luck with the dark meat. There were no jalape\u00f1os in the chicken.",1

Entire place was empty except for one table at 12pm (lunchtime) on a Monday.

The sign above the drink cooler telling us to \""""smile that we are on camera and to be honest and pay for our beverages\"""" was a nice welcoming touch. Was loud inside the shop as two large industrial fans are blasting overhead. They also nickel and dime you and charge you an additional 50 cents to use a credit or debit card. The sandwiches already cost about $8 - $10 on average, not exactly reasonable when you add in the extra fee. \n\nThe sandwiches are made fresh and they took about 10 minutes before they were ready. So if you are pressed for time you nay want to call ahead. The Asiago Cheese Bagel that was on my California Club was stale and crunchy like a saltine cracker. The avocado slice on the sandwich was turning brown and starting to oxidize (see photo) - thought they were made \""""fresh?\"""" Why serve a customer a brown avocado? The turkey was wet and dripped water from the bottom when I attempted to eat it. My wife also complained that her plain bagel was also stale and tasteless. She also had wet meat on her sandwich and dripped all over when trying to eat. The sandwiches were edible at best and they did give us good sized portions. \n\nSummary: We were a bit disappointed by our first visit here. Expected so much more for a place called \""""Empire Bagel's.\""""  Most likely will not stop back if we are on this side of town again. \n\nWe are still on the hunt for the perfect bagel in the Las Vegas valley that reminds us of the chewy and tasty bagels we grew up on back home...",0
2614,"Being that you are in Las Vegas, you know you want one of those big long tall cups to walk around the strip and the casino drinking away your alcoholic beverage ready to give some life to the night. I was sucked into creating this momento in my last Las Vegas visit. I should have asked and checked yelp first but I didn't, if I did, I might not have purchased the Big Chill drink... here are my reasons why:\n\n1. I was totally surprised to see that there was no line to place an order here so I was pretty excited about that. There was only one person working behind the bar and he was very unapproachable. I asked if I was able to taste the flavors prior to purchasing my drink and he said yes so I did. I asked him for his favorites, tasted those and the ones I wanted to try as well. He never in the whole time that I was there smiled at me or even bother having small talk... kinda sad. I did not like that at all.\n\n2. NO DISCOUNTED REFILLS!!!!! With this being said, you will be stuck with a giant cup that just maybe... maybe be able to reuse for like a piggy bank or something. It was pretty lame. I ended up reusing it with my own booze though and then tossed it. Fat Tuesday though does give you the refills for a discounted price.\n\n3. Light alcohol flavor... I like the taste of alcohol, what can I say... unfortunately this drink was light for my taste but not overly sweet so that was a good thing. I paid about $17 bucks for my big chill drink (my flavor was the Blue Ice) for maybe two shots of vodka in it. I guess you can say it was about 8 dollars a shot. This is basically a slurpee with a few shots of booze that will lead to a brain freeze here and there. The husband had a few sips himself and kept mixing the drink around thinking that the alcohol was sitting at the bottom.. to his taste, the alcohol was well mixed in there and he could still taste it. \n\n\nLocation: In the Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino near a Starbucks right when you are gonna go catch the tram to hit up Aria and the Crystal shops. \n\nOne star for an ok tasty slurpee drink and the convenient location.",0
2615,"BOOBIES + HOT WINGS = PARADISE!!!!!\n\nTheoretically, the above equation rings true.  Not so much at the Hooter's in Vegas.  From a dining standpoint, it sucked.  The service was very slow (how does it take 45 minutes to fry up wings!?), the coffee was served in styrofoam cups, the \""""plates\"""" were wet (ewwwww).  The wings were pretty good, but not spectacular.\n\nWell...since the food sucked, BRING ON THE BOOBIES!  Again, disappointment.  Even the main attraction, the so-called \""""Hooter's Girls\"""" were meh.  Lots of skinny legs, flat asses and fake hootie-hoos. \n\nI dunno. I just didn't get it.  Maybe cause our party consisted of two straight girls and a gay man, but I just wasn't terribly impressed with Hooters.",0
2616,"If i could give 0 stars i would.  Absolutely the worst internet/cable provider ever.  Additional charges, 10-45 minute waits to speak with a customer service representative, often getting hung up on.  Lying sales people who don't tell you their special offer was only for a limited time then receiving bills for 4x what you were quoted.  And each time you can never get a hold of customer service representative, but if you hit the button for new or upgraded service you are immediately connected to someone, who apologizes that they can't help with your problems and puts you on hold only to be hung up on.",0
2617,"Stopped in once for a chai tea, hot coffee for the wife, who is a coffee snob (you know you are, honey). I was curious to try this place, as I had toured it a few years ago when it was ripped down to the studs and was on the South Side home tour. It was really very cute inside. We got our beverages and got a slice of banana bread to go. Well, I'm sorry to report the banana bread was really dry, the chai tea was weak and downright flavorless. Wife hated her coffee. With every sip, she said, \""""Ooooo, not good\"""". \""""I don't like this\"""", until finally after giving it one last try, wincing, and throwing her overpriced beverage in the trash.\nThe decor is cute, but the quality of the product just wasn't good. We will know better next time.",0
2618,"I asked my buddy where I could acquire a delicious dark beer last night, and immediately was told to get to the Yard House because they serve at least 100 different beers from all over the world. I had also never been here before, so there was no argument from me.. \n\nI saw the Chocolate Stout on the menu and BAM, my mind was made up. It was such a perfect decision too.. definitely recommend trying it. Being adventurous, I also had their Orange Blossom Cream Ale and a Lindeman's Framboise. Interesting combination I know, but YUM. \n\nOnto the food -  we started with the Grilled Korean BBQ beef, (boneless beef short ribs marinated in garlic, soy and brown sugar with jasmine rice, sesame spinach, carrots, bean sprouts and green onions) - very good, great flavor, nice portion, could even be ordered as your main course IMO. For my entree I had the Mushroom Lettuce Wraps, (stir fried, smoked tofu, pine nuts and green onions with three dipping sauces and shiitake & portabella mushrooms), also very good, and healthy!! My friend ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken which had a mushroom sauce, sun-dried tomatoes and garlic mashed potatoes. Not my first choice, but it was very tasty and the mashed potatoes were so creamy, my mouth is watering thinking about them! For Dessert I had the Youngberry Chocolate which is Lindeman's Framboise & Young's chocolate Stout together (since both were delicious, I had to try them together, naturally). Prices ranged from reasonable to pretty expensive, the drinks were definitely in the very expensive range, as reflected in our well over $100 tab.. I will definitely be returning for happy hour one of these days for the lower drink prices. Service was great, bathrooms were super clean, all in all, I am a fan!!",1
2619,"I've been to like 2 Vietnamese restaurants in my life, so I'm not an expert and can't compare this to anything else.  But I really liked the food and the flavors of this food.  I could see the menu being a little overwhelming but I asked some people who'd been before and checked the other Yelp reviews and decided on the following:\n\nBeef Chow Fun - Yum.  Greasy but excellent dish.  Kind of reminded me of Mongolian beef over noodles.   Fun indeed.\n\nSpicy Beef w/ Rice Noodles - Probably my favorite of the soups I tried.  This had a little bit more going on that just broth and noodles.  Good enough that at some point, I will crave a bowl and be back for it.\n\nFreshly Sliced Beef Pho - This was what I expected.  A kind of nicely flavored beef broth soup.  A little bland for me, but my kids LOVED it.\n\nPork Bun (pork and egg rolls on cold vermicelli noodles) - I was most surprised by this one.  Cold noodles and fish sauce makes me say \""""meh,\"""" but I really liked this dish.  Fish sauce and all.  Actually the sauce probably made the dish.\n\nAs everyone else has said, the places is pretty cheap.  Unlike everyone else... you can keep the darn spring rolls.  Egg roll... awesome.  Cold transparently wrapped bunches of tasteless lettuce... not so much.",1
2620,"Wanna know how to tell when your lunch salad is REALLY good?\n\nWhen you \""""drool a little bit\"""" in between bites, like I did today with my Chopped Turkey Salad from La Grande Orange.\n\nI went there on Sunday 10-24, and to be honest, the setup is a little confusing for newcomers.  Order on THIS side, pickup food on THAT side, come back to THIS side to get dessert.  It's enough to make you want to just get in the car and drive home.  But DON'T!!!\n\nIf it weren't for the \""""Drool Event\"""" which occurred today, I probably would not have posted this review at all.\n\nI shared the Green Chile Burger with my daughter, and we were both underwhelmed, really.  Nothing awesome about the burger.  Oh, it's FAR better than fast food burgers, but it's not comparable to Lobby's or Chuckbox (my two top burgers in town, probably.)  The french fries were a little thin and not too memorable really.\n\nMy son had the wings and loved them  But a hitch - I SPECIFICALLY requested RANCH for the wings, and they came out with Blue Cheese, which I then had to take back and get exchanged for Ranch.  Not a huge problem, but just a little annoying.  The Ranch was very good however.\n\nThe \""""Olive Oil Cake\"""" that everyone RAVES about?  Meh.  It's just an extra-moist version of your average pound cake.  Tastes just like the pound cake I grew up eating in Texas, but it was a little \""""oilier\"""" than your usual pound cake fare.  It was good, but not \""""Oh My God!\"""" good.\n\nNow for the best item I had from there:  The Drool Creator.\n\nIt was mostly an afterthought, really.  While standing in line to get the Olive Oil cake to go, I saw the little section where they keep their \""""to go\"""" salads.  I looked around at the varieties, and thought the Chopped Turkey Salad looked promising - bacon, boiled egg, turkey slices, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and two different dressings - Blue Cheese and some sort of yellowish vinaigrette.   I decided to take one home and eat it for lunch at work on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nGreat.  Decision.\n\nI don't really know what the magic was.  Maybe it was just a good combination of flavors.  Maybe it was just all fresh.  Maybe they use some sort of Magical Salad Crack.  I don't know.  But it was a DANG good salad.  Even on the third day, when I ate the last of it.\n\nI just combined both dressings ( about half of each little container each day ) and it was marvelous.\n\nNot too many meals cause me to drool in between bites.  This salad had some serious Mojo.\n\nI WILL be back for another one, hoping to recapture the Magic.",0
2621,"Horrible!!! I ordered the gyro, the meat was  frozen strips of who knows what! I took one bite and  had to spit it out. The owner took my order and said 10 minutes but it was more like 30.

2623,"I got a staph infection the first day I went here. I've been stuck inside for the past week because of this... and at 26 I have a pretty good immune system, rarely ever am I sick. \n\nI believe this happened on the MMA mats (could have been the equipment though), the instruction itself was good, the people were cool, but the mats stunk terribly... as if they've rarely been washed. I've trained in other MMA gyms for about a year now, and have never had an issue (where mats are cleaned regularly).    \n\nAt $20/mo it sounds like a deal, but $200+ in meds and otc products could have you rethinking things. Overall, I guess you get what you pay for.",0
2624,"This is the WORST AIRLINE I've flown on in a long time. They're disorganized, rude, and there is very limited seating at their departure gates. Literally for a full flight there were 15 seats at the gate. I asked their service person why this was and she said 'because you'll get to sit when you're on the plane.' I will avoid this airline at all costs in the future.",0
2625,"Still in search of a good breakfast place in Scottsdale, and the Breakfast Joynt left a lot to be desired. First the service was slow but friendly, and because I pay the bill I appreciated the $1.95 for the large glass of chocolate milk for my son and good size cup of hot chocolate for my daughter. As far as my meal the corned beef beef hash was OK nothing special, the hash browns went from burnt on the edges to barely cooked in the middle, sausage gravy and biscuits were good but would of been a lot better had they been served hot. Everything else was just OK. Don't order the \""""Almost World Famous Apple Pancakes\"""" don't even call ahead (as they suggest) we ordered them knowing that they would take 30 minutes to prepare, so we all ate breakfast and sampled them after our meal. It's just a big bowl of cooked custard with apples. absolutely NO flavor. Don't waste the time or your money.",0
2626,"My favorite big place to see a concert! Its a small venue that is still able to capture the big acts (The Killers, Smashing Pumpkins). I also agree that there is not really a bad seat in the house, and its always nice and cool inside - especially in the summer! Its also pretty cool for a comedy show  (Dave Chappelle), and the Blue Collar Comedy Tour was filmed there. Now downtown just needs some better nightlife to accompany the venues down there! Oh also, something better than $8 beers please.. come on!",1
2627,"Went here for lunch and OMG! was it ever delicious!  The octopus appetizer is very good. I also had SEPPIE NERE 22.59\nRisotto with shrimp, scallops and fresh Mediterranean cuttlefish with natural black ink\nIt doesn't look very pretty, but this dish is wonderful and one of the best things I've ever eaten.  Highly recommend both of these items.  The wait staff was very kind and helpful.  We sat in the fake \""""outside\"""" area which was quite lovely.  The only annoying part was there were opera type singers close by in the open Venetian mall area that were extremely loud... so loud that we needed earplugs I kid you not!  We were so happy when they stopped.\nAlso wanted to point out there is a happy hour that looked really good.  There is no mention of it on their website or anywhere... I would have gone to it if I had known since they have some food items half price I believe and drinks at a discount.  Will definitely go back to this restaurant every time I return to Vegas... just hope they fire the opera singers!  :)",1
2628,"I hate to put two stars, but.. I have experienced better. Especially for the price. This was my first visit, and, frankly, it made me want to go back for the bar but not the restaurant.\n\nThere were definitely good points. The service was great, and I enjoyed the cocktail that I ordered off the menu. Also, they had a couple of lesser-known cocktail classics that made me think the bartending staff know their thing. The wine by the glass menu had nice choices, too.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was mixed. I had the pork dumplings for an appetizer. The combination of flavors in the filling, dip and wrapper was very good, but the wrapper was unusually thick and distractingly chewy, even gummy (as in, it stuck to my teeth and the roof of my mouth gummy). The server said they'd just started making their wrappers in-house, and I think they need some work.\n\nI had the chicken ramen soup for a main course. It just wasn't very good. I didn't expect it to be up to Vancouver BC standards (that city seems to have a thing for ramen), but the noodles were a bit tough, and a whole lot of the flavor came from salt. This includes the broth and the chicken. I didn't really want to eat it; I just tried the leftovers, and I don't really want to eat them either.\n\nIf the food were at 2/3 to 3/4 of the price I'd give it three stars. As it is, I wish I'd gone somewhere else. Clearly, other people love the place. Maybe I'll give it another chance, if I'm with friends who want to go.",0
2629,"Don't come here for pizza. I looked at reviews to find a pizza place in Casa Grande to get a slice or personal pizza and thought that this place wouldn't be bad based on reviews. I was wrong.\n\nI ordered a sausage and mushroom pizza. The pizza barely had any cheese on it in the first place, but neither the sausage nor the mushrooms were actually baked INTO the pizza. It was obvious that they had pre-made cheese slices that they warmed up on the stove top and just sprinkled the ingredients on. The crust was a decent thin crust, but the mushrooms were greasy and rubbery, the taste of the sausage was indescribable and gross (seriously, if you insist on getting pizza here, don't get the sausage).",0
2630,First timer! I had to try 2!\nI ordered the Totally Green Smoothie which is so refreshing and has just enough sweetness (green apple & kiwi). It's my first time having anything with Kale & I think it's delicious! Definitely something I will try at home & have again when I'm in the area. \nMy second drink I wanted a yogurt blend & chose the Get Up and Goji. It's like a nice refreshment at the beach. Light & tangy & sweet with the lil fullness of yogurt. \nOnly reasons I didn't give 5 stars were:\nThey only offer 1 size & it's $5 a drink. \nThe place is small & loud. \nCustomer service was ok but not great.,1

It's Vegas and if you're a couple mos def something good to wet the appetite, if you're into that like me. =P Our seats were at the front row but on the left side of the stage. Nice views that were closeup and intimate, but I've heard it's better to sit in the middle and further back to see the full scope of the stage. I dunno about that but I enjoyed the close up view myself. Pricey but worth it, afterall it's Vegas baby!",1
2632,Very disappointed in this place.  It's looks clean and nice on the outside so I thought I might have found a great spot for a good breakfast burrito.  Unfortunately the burrito was not that good and they got one of my orders completely wrong so my wife didn't even get to eat hers.,0
2633,"The Gold's Gym in Fitchburg served me well for a good two years. I was sad to leave it when I moved to Baltimore. \n\nThis location was newly built within the past 5 years. The equipment still seems pretty new. There's a pool, sauna, cinema room, and day care in additional the weights and cardio rooms and equipment. The basketball court is kind of small, but they just renovated it to have hardwood floors. At least they have one. Not all gyms in the area do.\n\nThere's always promotions going on, and depending on when you sign up you could be in for a good deal. I remember when I first signed up, I got two months free. Then the next year, they ran a deal where if you get people to sign up under you, they add $20 to the total cost and split it among those people. For example, if I was paying $40 and I get two people to sign up under me, everyone gets to pay $26.67.",1
2634,Mmmm I love Johnny rockets.  $22 gets you 2 orders of burgers fries and a soda. Groupon had a discount so check it out.  I hate pickeles but it was just so.good in my burger.  Sometimes it can get very greasy but they made it just right this time around.,1

2641,I can't actually comment on the food.  The place looked nice relative to a lot of neighboring establishments and was recommended by our lunch-time server @ Nola (very good Creole) and our concierge.  My low rating comes from the fact that I called twice to make a reservation and no one answered.  After taking a cab from downtown we learned there was a private party and we wouldn't be able to take in the Jersey Shore fist pumping scene (thanks Callan W for the visual).

I'm a travel nurse on an assignment in Chandler and I hadn't been to a chiropractor in years but decided it was time to get my body back into shape. I found Dr Steve on yelp and I am so happy I did. To start, Carmen and Anasia are super helpful. Anasia knows what she is doing and both of them greet you with a smile always. Dr Steve is great as well, he is very intelligent but warm and friendly, he also remembered my name everytime I came in. Just like some of the other Yelp poster's said, he spends quite a bit of time with you and is very invested in your care; he certainly is very busy but I never felt rushed by any of the staff. He has young and old coming to him and I think that's a compliment to his treatment style. I appreciated his passion for results and working as a \""""team\"""" with me; He even offered to do some research on kinesio tape that I asked him about so we might be able to incorporate it into my treatment.\n\n I felt like he appreciated my input as to how I was feeling and he always answered any questions I had. He's very much into a holistic type of care. He has the up to date technology but also has the natural/holistic too. He put me on a program of several times a week and within the first few visits I was already in a better mood and sleeping soundly. He also has insight into diet and making your whole body better not just doing the physical manipulation.  Everybody that I met there was happy and felt great, so that obviously shows something about Dr Steve's skills as a chiropractor.\n\nI recently went on vacation then found out I was moving. I was so busy I didn't have time to call and let them know; but then they called me concerned about how I was doing because I hadn't been in lately.

2649,Would not come here again. Burnt crusts and still dough in the middle. Not flavorful all the only taste that stood out was the burnt taste. They were shady with the toppings. If you are going to charge a dollar a topping I expect more than three pieces of pineapple a slice. Tables sat with dirty dishes. Soda machine wasn't that great needed more carbonation I think.

2650,"We left LA at 1:30pm didn't get there until 7pm. Terrible traffic on the 15, you think that leaving at 1pm one would avoid traffic. We came here to attend EDC (Electrical Daisy Carnival).

The only casual fast food available were Pizza, Chinese, and Mexican place. If you wanted wonton noodle soup you won't get it here.

BTW, you can't order a smaller version of a sandwich for a cheaper price. And, if you split a sandwich (recommended) then yet another charge is added on top!

2653,"I've lived in Madison for almost 8 years now and somehow had never made my way over to Bluephies, which I had heard was great for years. Last week I was finally in the area and suggested going to my friend who lives nearby. We went for dinner on a Tuesday night and I can't say I was impressed. \n\nWe were seated immediately in the center of their main dining room and told our server would be right with us. About 10 minutes went by and still no one had come over to our table, even to give us a couple of waters. Several other tables had been seated since we arrived and they had all received water and their other drink orders. Eventually we made eye contact with one of the servers who went straight to the other servers and pointed to us. After that our waitress came right over and apologized (apparently there was some confusion over who's section we were in). She was very friendly, but didn't offer to do much to make up for our 15 minute wait. \n\nI ordered a couple of their specialty vodka cocktails. They were fine, but nothing special. The zucchini appetizer with french onion dip was delicious and was the best part of the meal. For my entr\u00e9e I ordered the chile rellenos and was pretty disappointed. The menu described a pepper stuffed with rice, mushrooms and spinach. If there was anything besides rice in the pepper I couldn't see it or taste it. The black bean corn relish was mostly a heaping pile of black beans, next to a far too large helping of mole. The \""""avocado salad\"""" was a dollop of guacamole. Overall the dish wasn't bad in terms of taste, however it was entirely too small. Poblano peppers aren't too big but for 16 dollars I guess I expected more than one or for it to be battered and fried like I've had before. It was really just a small pepper with a bit of rice inside and a ton of black beans and mole. The topper of it all was our waitress decided to crack some joke about how hungry I must have been to have eaten so quickly. I had to bite my lip to avoid asking her how long it would take her to eat ten bites of food. \n\nOverall the food was slightly above average but WAY overpriced. I mean WAY overpriced. For 16 dollars I can get a much better and much larger meal downtown around the square. I've heard great things about their brunch so maybe dinner just isn't their forte. I'm glad I finally went, but I won't be back. Not for dinner anyway.",0

2655,"Dr. Adams is a wonderful doctor.  She is extremely caring, attentive and knowledgeable.  If this review were just for her adequacy as a physician, I would have given her 5 stars. Carly, Dr. Adams' admin, is also a joy to speak with.  She goes above and beyond her call of duty and will to try to help you in every way possible.  \n\nThe two main points that deserve a negative (yes, extremely subpar) rating are:\n\n1. The wait time.  I'm not sure how her staff books her patients; however, I have never had to wait any less than an hour for any of my SCHEDULED appointments.  I once had an appointment at 9:30 and did not get called back for my vitals until 11:40...absolutely ridiculous.\n\n2. Her nurse, Yolanda.  Let me preface this by saying that I am an RN.  I fully understand just how hectic and chaotic a busy physician's office can get at times.

2662,"I was dying for some drunken noodles, saw this place close and gave it a go.

I ordered takeout drunken noodles and asked how long it might be since I know they just walked in, 5 min.  I didn't know whether to be happy or scared.  How could that be ready in 5 min? It was obvious they took old stuff and just re fried it, pretty greasy and nothing tasted fresh.  I am not one to know authenticity, but I had some drunken noodles in San Diego that I am trying to find something similar here.  This is my 3rd round with the noodles and just a few other times eating Thai apart from that, but this was my worst for sure out of all of them.  I don't know Thai food real well, but I know fresh, and I didn't get anything fresh here.  Also, smelled like old lady moth balls",0

One of them thought the spice level was just right the other thought it was just a little too much. \n\nMy Tom Yum was very tasty and loaded with lots of yummy bits.\n\nThe Pineapple Curry would probably be great for someone who isn't sure if they like thai food.

2668,"I think the cheese pizza was great.  Because of it's popularity, there's probably a high turnover, so they probably keep bringing in the hot pies.  As for the other pies sitting there, they don't have that hot out of the oven taste.  The pepper and pepperoncini pizza was not good at all.  Not as hot as the cheese, and the taste of the pepperoncini  kills that pizza taste.  So for the taste itself, one great slice of the cheese, and one horrible slice of the combo, and factoring the high price ($4.75 for the cheese and $6+ for the combo, it was a little disappointing.  Stick with the cheese slice, and you'll be happy.  It's pretty good, but I don't have that urge to go back.",0

It felt to me like they just warmed them up and served them. Not impressed. Next out was the pot pie. Not a traditional looking pot pie. It had a lattice  pattern crust just laying on top. The crust was very buttery, so much so it over powered the rest of the flavors in the pie. The veggies were a disappointment as well. Tasted and looked as if they were from a can of veggie medley. \n   Now the good news, a gentleman (who I assume was the manager) came to ask how my meal was and I told him. He told me how they were planning to take the pot pie off the menu for some of the reasons I had described and replaced my pork rinds with the Grilled Bacon appetizer. Now that was amazing! Think cut bacon steaks with a jalape\u00f1o jelly that had just the right kick and a slaw of pickled cucumbers and carrots. That made up for my entire meal.

I called last week, in pain, and explained that I had seen their reviews on Yelp and worked right down the way and could they see me?  And they squeezed me right in!  They also emailed me the paperwork to speed up the check in process and they even called me this morning with a cancellation and offered to take me even earlier today.  I am impressed with the ease of getting an appointment!   \n\nAlso, when I walked in I liked that the office is clean and tastefully decorated with a good selection of reading materials, having both men and women's magazines.

Today it was The Muppets pirate movie. (YAY, I LOVE THE MUPPETS!)  The dental assistant, Raquel, was super sweet and polite too.  \n\nThe x-rays are taken in the chair and are shown to you instantaneously on a computer monitor placed on an exam table in front of the chair.  The dentist, Dr. Barela, was warm and friendly and never left me waiting for him to come see me.  He took the time to thoroughly explain everything on the x-rays and then he examined my teeth in detail and suggested a very reasonable course of treatment.  (Some dentists make me feel like they are suggesting such a radical treatment plan that I sometimes suspect that it's overkill just to make more money, but I didn't feel that here AT ALL!)  We both agreed that I needed just one filling and he asked if I'd like it done today...I was stunned.  A same day treatment, while I'm already here and ready to go?  Why yes, please, thank you!  \n\nHe was ready to do the filling within minutes and he was super gentle and friendly.  He explained everything as he did the filling too, so I wasn't left there wondering what was going on the whole time.  Believe me, the whole process was PAINLESS.   While he was in there he also added some anti-sensitivity medicine to a couple of teeth that were a bit sensitive (but good otherwise) and he grinded down a high spot on a crown that I got a year ago that never did feel quite right.  I thought was was going above and beyond doing that, and I was impressed; really impressed!!\n\nFolks, please believe me when I tell you I am a full blown, dental chicken after I had a root canal on a badly abscessed tooth when I was 19 that so painful and traumatic that other people could hear me screaming and sobbing clear out in the dentist's lobby.

This place is great.\n\nOh, I almost forgot to mention that I needed to schedule a cleaning, and instead of the typical cleaning appointment that has to be scheduled weeks and weeks out, they actually had an appointment available for me next week at a time that actually works for me AND availability for my teenage daughter to her her teeth cleaned next week after school too.  They are very accommodating of your schedule and I really appreciated that flexibility.\n\nThis is a great dentist.  I couldn't recommend them any more highly!",1

2683,"Yesterday, two co-workers and I got $18 tee times at Desert Rose, which we had deemed a steal. We'd never been, but I knew that it was the oldest course in Las Vegas. It's also in a dire state of emergency; frankly I'm surprised it's still operating. I live on the east side near UNLV, which is no utopian paradise by any means. So when I say that the neighborhood surrounding the course is sketchy, I mean bombed out and on the verge of being condemned. There were more boarded-up houses on the entrance road than I could easily count. Somewhere around the 7th hole a kid in a neighboring house was yelling at us while we were teeing-off in an attempt to distract us. I believe it was the 16th hole where a gentleman in front of us intentionally drove a ball into another neigboring house (we assumed for similar circumstances). And, not sure which hole it was where someone had their home stereo cranked to 11 blasting some sort of favela crunk. \n\nEnough of the fun stuff, let's talk about the course:  There is a dry wash that cuts through Desert Rose, which is literally a trash dumping site. See my photos. This starts at the first hole, and continues through most of the course. There is also a creek with actual water running through it (a flowing trash heap), and dozens of ducks hanging around the first two holes (duck crap covers the greens). The fairways have a 20-foot wide swath of live grass leading up to the greens, everything else is brown, dead, dusty mess. My bag literally emanated a dust cloud when I smacked it at the end of the day. There are two areas where the golf cart goes through concrete flash flood sewer areas covered with grafitti. It looks and feels like the inspiration behind a Red Hot Chili Peppers song. \n\nThere are two holes where the signs have been stolen, most of the bunkers don't have rakes either (assumed they were also stolen). I believe it was the 13th or 14th hole that was literally a construction site (tractors, caution tape, sewer pipes) which required driving the cart \""""off road\"""" into the drainage ditch. One bonus was that whenever I sliced and lost a ball in the drainage ditch abyss, I usually found 2-3 other lost balls to replace it. We chatted with an older gentleman looking for his ball on the other side of the ditch; he said \""""I think it may have landed in this trash heap\"""". When was the last time you said that at a golf course?  \n\nOnto the positive part of the review. The clubhouse was fairly comfortable, had some great deals on gear (we bought some balls and tees), and had great food in my opinion. The bartender/server was professional and attentive. I'm a fan of \""""vintage Vegas\"""" which is why I wanted to try this course (I also want to try National; I hope it's better) but in this case it's fallen into neglect.

2685,"Cute little breakfast spot. I had the Huevos Rancheros, which were delicious. Not smothered in enchilada sauce like most places. I was a little disappointed at first that it came with chips instead of tortillas, but the crunch was a nice addition. Even though you order up front then sit down (in which most places you never hear from anyone after you get your food) the girls here are on top of their game and checked in with me half way through my meal. If I lived here I would definitely be back!",1
2686,"We came to ride the gondolas, 4 of us. We were interested in riding the outside ones, so we asked an employee who was there greeting us as we walked in where we could purchase them. He directed us to a desk with 2 guys, who said they could sell them to us. \nCome to find out he was just trying to sell us show tickets and wasted an hour of our time. Once he realized we weren't  buying any show tickets, he told us where we could buy them. He also told us my daughter  was too young to ride, she is 2.5. Once we got outside, they said she could and we couldve bought the tickets out there in the 1st place. So we get on and the ride was nice, too short though. Same price as 1 of the pictures they try to sell you at the end. Then as we were about dock, our boatman mentions that tips are greatly appreciated.  I was going to tip, but felt kind of odd being asked to tip. I still did, but felt weird afterwards. Never again. Plus too, there is no buffet here, and if there is I couldnt find it. Felt like I was at a car lot and just got suckered. Employees here just felt too pushy, like those people in the mall. And they didn't have their information right. Nice hotel, but the customer service is terrible!",0
2687,"This is probably the best toy store I've been - there is a large range of toys, however, it seems geared more toward adults and older children.\n\nThere are a lot of collectibles in locked cases and the best part, the huge wall of Funko Pop vinyl figures! These are adorable vinyl figures of popular television, movie, and real life characters that have been shrunk down and paired with disproportionally large heads. Prior to The Toy Box, I would purchase these vinyl figures on Amazon (if available). Although most of the prices are higher compared to Amazon, it's nice to see them in person and there are many figures that are hard to find online. They seem to range in price depending on their popularity, but they start around $10.\n\nThey have a nice Yelp check-in offer of 15% off one item, so don't forget to utilize it!",1
2688,"I am adding Jasper's Peak in my favorite places to sit outside and eat, WITH my golden retriever.  The tables are large, so there's room for him to sit underneath the table and not disturb non-dog people.  The food is good but most of the time I am eating the appetizers.  There's one with spicy shrimp that's the best.  The staff is very friendly.  And, there's a bit of a party atmosphere which I like.",1
2689,"Ridiculously amazing show!!!!\n\nHubby and I were completely astonished! \n\nSat in the \""""premium seats (the middle between splash zone and VIP)\"""" section A, H 15&16.  Considered the VIP section but after seeing the seats, don't think they're really worth it...they seat further back but the seats are rather lush.  Guess it really boils down to whether or not you really want the champagne!\n\nSaw some people in the splash zone move up to the 'premium seats' shortly after the first gig - I'd pay the extra $30 to not sit in the splash zone...but if you can choose seats in the 2nd row up I guess its good savings? I prefer Orchestra like seats so H did us just fine.\n\nDon't look up any videos on this!  It's best to go in with no expectations...get ready to be blown away!!:)",1

The bread pudding was the best I've ever had and I don't LOVE bread pudding-- but I LOVED this one.  Also, they make their own ice creams and their are delicious.  The fish I had was extremely fresh. I am no food critic, but I did grow up on the East Coast beaches of NC, so I can say with certainty the fish is fresh.  I love that they use local vendors for most of the food and the atmosphere of the restaurant is cozy and hip.  \n\nMy complaint, the service.  Flighty is a word that comes to mind.  The food took a really long time to come out and I have yet to figure out if that was the kitchen staff OR our waiter not putting our order in on time.\n\nAll that said, this is a place I will most certainly come back to.",1
2692,"Updated: the owners mailed us a check refunding us completely for the grooming. However, the letter they included with it was still rude! Even if they believed that shaving my dog was a \""""miscommunication\"""", they should accept responsibility and apologize. Instead, the owner said he did what he believed was best....without even calling first to check if it was ok. Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever received.

We were surprised by a \""""resort fee\"""" which was crap.  We never got the newspaper they said we would get.  The heater in the room didn't work and it was very smoky despite being the least smoky place!  Main floor is confusing as all get out.  The tv remote didn't work correctly and the tv picture was crap and the buttons didn't work.  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE eat at the buffet.  It was the PITS.  The Paradise Cafe was better but expensive for diner food.   We were told they had wireless internet, but discovering in the room that they didn't.. called the front desk, said there was a cable to use.  We couldn't find it so they said they would send someone with a new cable.. and they never came.  This place blows and I won't stay here again.",0

I'm also a huge fan of the wasabi mashed potatoes. I have never had a problem with the freshness or qualitly with my burgers or steak either and they have ALWAYS been cooked to my liking as I find that alot of resturants in Phoenix will scorch the heck out of a piece of beef and then you get this black piece of grizzle and Hulas doesn't do that.\n\nAhh..the drinks..strong delicious cheap big. If you go with friends get the scorpion bowl its a huge bowl of liquory goodness that comes flaming with these huge straws to drink out of. The pink bikkini Martini tastes like a watermelon Jolly rancher too and its awesome. \n\nThe waitstaff is amazing too ask for Tia and you won't be disspointed.

The steam room burned my foot a bit while I used the cool shower and the steam started up again. Warnings should be put up or the steam grate replaced. It hurt! But no noticeable burn. The showers were large and had all the necessary items including supplies to use to get well prepared for any plans post spa use. The roman pool was large but with several groups, the space was tight. The granola, fruit, teas, juices, water, lounge area, cold towels etc just added to the amenities. The scent of the spa was fantastic. \nThe highlight of the spa experience really was meeting Michelle, the manicurist. She did such a wonderful job. The best manicure I have ever had.

2721,"I was staying at a hotel about.8 miles away as I was going to the Fiesta Bowl, and I noticed that they had an ad about delivering food to the hotel. Then I started reading the small print. Does not include tip, tax, $3 set up charge, etc. I decided to go there so I called. I told the girl where I was staying, lots of one way streets, etc. and asked for directions from my hotel. Lots of um's and ah's and she then asked me to wait until she got someone else on the phone. I almost hung up and then another dizzy girl picked up and she started stammering and stuttering without any clear directions, until she told me to wait until she got someone else on the phone, and I said, \""""never mind\"""" and hung up. I went to the front desk at the hotel and the woman there gave me clear directions in about  2 minutes. I was on the phone with the two dingbats for about 15 to 20 minutes. I drove over and it took about 5 minutes to get there. I walked in and the restaurant was packed, so I went into the lounge to see if I could order in there. As I was walking about, I received \""""hard\"""" looks from the guys on duty there, bouncers I guess. I looked at the jerk, turned around and went to the reception area and asked one of the young ladies how long it would take for a table for one. She said about an hour and a half. I asked her if she was serious and she said \""""yes\"""", so I left. When I got back to the hotel, I tried to order take out without success. Even though it was before 9PM and the order form said that they delivered up to that time, they said they were not delivering. I gues it was because it was New Years Eve. When I went to the office to look for another restaurant, I met some UConn fans, and as I was talking with them about Bobby Q, they said that Bobby Q wasn't that great when compared to a few CT barbecue places or some Southern places they visited in Charlotte during another bowl game. The famous cornbread did not live up to its rep, so I felt better. Then, they asked if I wanted to try some of their food. They had a bunch of leftovers, that they weren't going to eat, and I had a microwave in my room. Like them, I wasn't impressed with either the food or the famous sauce. More hype than good food, an incompetent wait staff, and nasty looking guys in the lounge does not look like a good time to me. Sorry Bobby Q.",0
2722,"This review is long, but you are likely to save yourself weeks of wasted time and frustration by reading it.\nWe wanted to replace our sectional and unfortunately stopped at this branch of Ashley Furniture. A sales associate noticed that we weren't really enthusiastic about anything and mentioned to us that there was a big sale coming up. We did the math and based on the savings, waited a few days for the sale and bought the sectional plus a dresser and a chest on December 18th. \nWe were in no particular rush to receive any of the items and asked when we could expect delivery of the furniture for planning purposes only. The sales associate checked the computer and advised us that Jan. 02nd would be possible. Just to emphasize a point here, this was her suggestion not our request. We made arrangements with a moving company to come in and remove our old, huge sectional before Ashley's scheduled delivery. On December 30th, 2013, a few days before scheduled delivery, we got a call from Ashley customer service (I think customer disservice is a more fitting name) advising us that they would not be able to deliver as promised, but would now need to reschedule for Jan 09th, 2014. The delay wasn't a huge issue. However, the agent had a disclaimer \""""subject to further delay\"""". That caught our attention and we decided to revisit the store to investigate further.\nInterestingly, when we called to cancel the pick-up of our old sectional, the lady on the phone was quite familiar with Ashley and their delays. Her exact words were \""""Oh, it's Ashley. It happens all the time\"""". This is not an isolated event.\nWe asked for a manager and after a brief delay, we were introduced to Alex. He listened, checked the computer and then advised us of a few things:\n- We'd need to call customer service (again) on our own. There was nothing that he could do. \n- If he tried to use internal channels to communicate within Ashley, the company he works for, it would be of less use than if we called in ourselves. He said that they give us, the customers, higher priority.  If that's true, I can't imagine how low his priority would be as it is clear to us that we don't matter to customer service. It felt more like passing the buck to get us out of the store.\nAs a last ditch effort before leaving the store, we asked which piece was not in stock. An agent checked the computer and realized that it was just one piece of the sectional- everything else was there. After some back and forth, we got them to agree that if there were any further delays, that we would be happy to receive the pieces that they already had in stock on the Jan 9th with the missing piece delivered at a later date. Alex gave us his word that we would not be charged a second $79.99 delivery fee. He assured us that the second fee would be taken care of and if there were any other problems, just give him a call. \nOn January 06th, 2014 my wife called Ashley customer disservice to see if everything was OK.  They advised her that there was going to be another delay. My wife explained to the customer disservice representative what happened and asked about delivery of the pieces that they had in stock. She said she'd have to clear that with a manager and get back to us. When she called back, she advised that it would not be possible to make two separate deliveries. \nMy wife decided to go see Alex at the store. This chameleon showed his true colors today. He was gruff, irritated and even more unhelpful. He regurgitated his favorite line \""""there's nothing I can do\"""", this time without the fa\u00e7ade of caring about the customer. To make things worse, when he checked the computer system to see which piece was causing the delay, he advised my wife that now two pieces of the sectional were out of stock. My wife was shocked. She asked how was that possible. He did not give a clear answer. However, the inference here is that they delivered the piece to another customer. \nThat was the last straw for us. We realized that we might have waited until March 2014 (or later) for delivery if Ashley ever thought highly enough of us to eventually deliver the items that we paid for. I asked my wife to request a refund. While relaying the request to Alex, my wife started to say to him that even though I would like a refund, she is not quite ready to give up. Alex cut her off mid-sentence and without even the pretense of caring, Alex started the refund process. My wife, out of curiosity, asked what does he think about Yelp reviews. As he turned his back on her and walked away, he said quite clearly \""""I don't believe in those things\"""".",0
2723,"I ordered pizza for pickup, once I arrived home I realized there was hair in my food. I simply called back to this location and asked for a remake and for them to deliver it to me. I didn't think this was to much to ask considering it wasn't my fault. I was told that's wasn't an option (all while being super rude) and when I asked to speak with the manager was told there wasn't one even tho when I picked up my pizza I clearly saw a man with a solid red polo shirt on which was different from the rest. They need to work on customer service.",0
2724,I really enjoy their subs and the poutine they serve here. The service is also friendly and quick regardless of the time of day or night. But the establishment is a little dirty specially the bathrooms. Atleast tonight... Overall i belive i will return here.,1
2725,"I had a good idea of what to expect, having had Laotian cuisine maybe once or twice in the past. I can't comment on the restaurant itself because my friend and I had our meals delivered. Upon its arrival (on time, btw), I realized there were two things I was not expecting:\n\n1) The portion size. $11.50 gets you a LOT of food, more than a petite person can finish by herself in one sitting. You're looking at about two meals counting the rice.\n\n2) The quality. My gut told me to order Tofu in Peanut Sauce with the lowest level of spiciness. My gut, as usual, did not steer me wrong.\n\nI regret that I wasn't able to take the leftovers with me (long drive home with no insulated bag), but the memory of that sweet and delicious food will live on!",1
2726,"I like this place. As a number of other people have mentioned, the chips and salsa are great. The horchata is also delicious and they give you free refills (utter madness but I love it). However, it wasn't the best mexican I've had, not even close to the top 5. For whatever reason, I was craving enchiladas. They did not turn out well. The sauce that came on the enchilada tasted like it was from a can. just terrible. My girlfriend's meal was much better. She had two steak tacos that looked pretty tasty. She really enjoyed  her meal. I'll be back to see if they just misfired on the enchiladas.\n\nUpdate: I came back and ordered the fish tacos. they were not good. won't be back.",0
2727,"The view is incredible! But if you're planning on a good meal to go along with the nice view,,,think again! This place was AWFUL!!!! From the bland salad and the horrible appetizers and the very -over priced dinner, it's just one disappointment to the next. If you just have to go here,,,get a drink, sit in the lounge and enjoy the music and the great view. DON'T Eat here you will be very disappointed!",0
2728,"My party ordered poutine and smoked meat, and it was very tasty. It's not as amazing as I was expecting genuine Montreal poutine to be, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. One minor complaint is that my entree didn't come with the advertised pickle, but I managed to survive.\n\nThe much larger problem I had with this restaurant is that the waiter gave a guilt-trip sob story about tips at the end of the meal. My bill was for $37, and I gave the waiter $40, expecting change. He started to tell me about how if they don't receive a large enough tip, they get taxed on it or some silly bullshit. I proceeded to tell him that I had intended to leave the actual tip on the table, which is what I always do, and I think that's fairly standard. He then said the exact same thing to our table mates.\n\nBegging for tips, regardless of how much customers decide to tip, is NEVER okay. This needs to stop. It made my party and I extremely uncomfortable. It appears that I'm not the only reviewer who had an experience like this.\n\nOn a final note, service was a little slow. We witnessed one table leave before being served after they'd waited long enough.\n\nUpdate: I complained about our waiter after our trip, but never received a response. That sort of behaviour cannot be excused. Don't eat here.",0

Give Postino Central time to hire a service focused staff with a sense of urgency before you come here. \n\nThe arrival of Postino in my 'hood was highly anticipated.  I was hoping the new \""""central\"""" location would be \""""inspired\"""" by Postino... not an Exact replica.. Which was a little boring!  We arrived at 7:30 to a full bar.. Which, a full bar is nothing new for this restaurant group, so why did it seem so chaotic? \n\nWe found some seats at the bar and waited to be served... and waited... and waited... we counted 3-4 on bar staff... yet the \""""main'\"""" bartender seemed pre-occupied, and easily distracted..

(Amazing that the owner was monitoring the restaurant, however did not pick up on the fact so many at the bar had to wait so long for service) \n\nThere was one lucky group at the bar, ( We think they were the original cast from  the movie Sixteen Candles  ) that enjoyed exceptional service and attention.. Full drinks at all times, maintaining the bartender's attention as the rest of the patrons suffered.  Perhaps they hypnotized or used voodoo on the staff... Hey...whatever it takes... I guess I'll go to a graveyard and kill a chicken at midnight before my next visit! \n\nThe bruschetta we ordered was great, the same quality as the Campbell location.  Warm, thickly sliced artisan bread, covered with generous amounts of toppings.  Our favorites were the prosciutto, Fig and mascarpone cheese and the Apple & Brie.. yummy!!!  The food was the only reason I gave this night a 2 star.  \n\nAlthough we fought our better judgment to leave after we enjoyed  our food... we stayed.  Big mistake!  We foolishly thought  once Jake Ryan and Caroline Mulford left the bar, the voodoo spell would be broken, that was not the case...the wait for the following drinks were just as lengthy as the first!\n\nIf I were the owner,.. I'd replace the Bar Staff with the Valet Staff..

2732,"I come to Nam's quite a bit for very specific dishes.  It is my belief that for asian restaurants in Madison, one has to pinpoint the original ethnicity of the restaurant to get the best food.  The original owner is from Hong Kong and has some vietnamese influence in his life.  With that in mind, I really enjoy the bun, their mi (noodle soups), and their pho.  I know a lot of people complain about the pho here, but I like it for its meatiness, which is not something I find in a lot of the other Vietnamese restaurants in Madison.  The bean sprouts and basil that usually accompany the soup are a bit lacking though.  In addition, their traditional chinese food is pretty good as well (like their congee).  From personal experience, I would not get the americanized chinese food....or the Pad Thai.  This place isn't even remotely Thai.  \nFor the food that I do like, I give it 4, maybe even 5 stars, but for the confusing menu, I have to go with 4",1

The AC in the room barely worked but was loud, and the rooms are small for King size.\neven with a reservation made a week prior we walked in to be told the choices in rooms were limited.

Luckily it's huge so we were seated right away. They had some awesome music playing, albeit loud, but we were here for a good time so it didn't bother us. I noticed they had $3 jaeger shots so we each started with those.  My husband ordered buffalo wings & I ordered the caesar salad foccacia wrap.  A few shots later our food came out. My husband loved his wings, my wrap was just meh.  Not much chicken & the fries that came with it were so soggy & greasy that they were inedible. Probably 2 stars for the food. I also ended the night with one of their $3 Zipparitas which was so unbelievably strong that my husband had to help me finish.  We will definitely be back soon, just not for food.  Their happy hours & reverse happy hours are awesome, something new every day of the week.",1
2736,"Pizza? Delicious. I am a huge fan of the crust. Same for the unconventional pizza toppings.\n\nBeer? Plentiful. $6 for a pint off happy hour is a little steep but I'll roll with it.\n\nService? Average. I rarely make special ingredient requests, it's usually \""""can I have the spicy ranch/sauce on the side instead of on the pizza\"""". Sometimes it comes out right, sometimes it doesn't, and sometimes the ingredient is both on the pizza and on the side. So, yeah, there is some disconnect between ordering and what comes out to you. I'll still eat the darn pizza, though.\n\nThe environment is just right for a laid back outing with a few friends or your date. A couple of brews, good food, good tunes and good conversation, you should be set.",1

I have been to there Madison location more than a dozen times and haven't had the same thing twice. All were great, some seasoned better than others, but all great. \n\nI look forward to going to this establishment and even crave it at times.",1
2739,"Ate there last night after seeing Criss Angel.  The hostess was rather rude when we asked if we could have a booth. I would have left right then but my husband was dying to try their burgers. He enjoyed it but said it was not really worth the price.  I ordered the Cobb salad. It was drenched in balsamic dressing that so over powered the meal it should have been called the vinegar salad.

It's not like we have a lot of great Chinese food restaurants here in Henderson, but after 30 years of having good Chinese in other cities I think I know  bland and bad.\n\nOrange chicken was gross, chicken egg rolls were hard and dry.

When I asked them, the sales lady tried to justify the price tag with warranty etc. but c'mon, more than twice the retail price? \nAlso, the high index lens cost almost 500, adding up to a grand total of 1350. As an international student, I do not have eye insurance so the price seems really ridiculous. \nThe eye exam cost 160 which I think is still much higher than average. \nI recently accompanied my friend to get a pair of designer glasses on Michigan avenue in Chicago, and the total cost is a mere 400, frame, lens and eye exam combined.\nMy advice, look elsewhere if you do not have insurance to cover the full price. They don't stick price tags to the frames so keep in mind the ridiculously high pricing when shopping.

2746,"This hotel is kind of a mixed bag.  The key attributes it has going for it are low room rates, decent rooms, and all of the desirable amenities included under a very low daily resort fee.  The problem is that the staff are not very friendly or accommodating at this hotel, and there is not much cleaning up after the less than considerate guests who jump on those low room rates for a stay in Vegas.  Sigh.  \n\nI would say I was pretty happy with the quality of my bed.  The room itself had no circulation though, and the air conditioner worked so efficiently that after five minutes of turning it on, it felt like a tundra.  There was no way to sleep through the night without shivering or waking up with a dry throat.  There was no balance at all.  The resort fee included free high speed internet which had a fairly good download speed.  It also includes a free daily paper, but don't expect them to deliver it to your door.  You have to go downstairs and ask for it, show ID, and maybe even be given a dirty look to get it.  The fitness center was beautiful with a wonderful range of current machines allowing me to do a full cardio/strength training workout.  Unfortunately the staff at the fitness center were not just unfriendly but rather rude (accusing me of not wearing shoes when I was for example and then having to show them my Brooks running shoes on my feet).  Also, the narrow hours that the fitness center was open (they close at 8pm) made it difficult to use.  The resort fee also includes phone calls, but they don't advertise that either; you just figure it out for yourself after a few days.  Security was pretty tight at the hotel in a way that it is not at the nearby Paris for example.  This went beyond looking out for the welfare of the guests to the point of being annoying.  \n\nIf only they showed the same zeal in keeping their common spaces tidy.  There is nothing more disgusting than walking into an elevator to your room and seeing it littered with spent cups and napkins.  Gross.  My recommendation, stay elsewhere.  At this price point, the Luxor is a much better deal.",0
2747,"Never have we been to an establishment that had such an air of pretentiousness. Rude and unwelcoming from the moment we walked in the door, the place was completely empty, yet the hostess sat in a chair on the phone for nearly five minutes while we stood there and every staff member that walked by advised the hostess would help us shortly. Eventually, the woman looked up from the phone, and without ending the conversation told us she could seat us if we agreed to \""""give up\"""" our seats by 6:05 (time was 3:45). This was the beginning of a most unpleasant dining experience. While the food was actually very good (other than a ground bay leaf in one of the pasta dishes), the waiter was extremely rude, never making eye contract, nose up, and as if he did not have the time of day (in a completely empty restaurant) for us. Plates picked up without asking if we were done, NEVER a smile, and truly one of the most unpleasant dining experience any of us in our party of six has ever had. I would advise any one looking for a welcoming and comfortable dining experience do everything possible to avoid this place.",0

We made reservations through the Light Group for a pre-fix bachelorette party dinner. Tom explained everything in detail and answered any questions we had on the menu. He made a great recommendation of a cucumber martini that we still rave about. The Kobe Burgers and Mac&Cheese sticks just melt in your mouth. \n\nI have to be honest though, I recommended FIX to my husband when the guys went out to Vegas for the Bachelor Party and they had an awful experience... the server was a complete arrogant a-hole. \nThe next day I recieved a very nice handwritten card from Tom thanking us for our visit...

The homemade blue cheese dressing was killer!\n\nEntree (1), Porcini Crusted Rib Eye-  First of all, this thing was HUGE (20 oz).  It was just enough sweet, peppery, and very tender.   Served with a side of fresh green beans and huge steak fries (fresh cut).\n\nEntree (2), Filet Mignon- Very nice cut of meat; tender and flavorful with a delicious wine sauce. Fresh green beans and yummy fresh made mashed potatoes served on the side. \n\nDessert, Extra large Homemade Chocolate Chip Cookie- Deliciously warm and moist.   We paired it with some espresso and house coffee. \n\nI highly recommend the Triple George.

The also gave us a discount card for one of the local pubs which was great. \nThey also did a discounted breakfast for a cafe next door which served lovely food!\n\nWe stayed in a private double room as we weren't up did bunking with loads of people. The room we stayed in was like an apartment more than a hostel. Fully kitted out with a great view if the city. \n\nThe hostel is positioned right bang in the heart of Edinburgh. Less than a ten minute walk from everything. There was so much to do and even though we were only in Scotland for a few days it was beautiful.\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone visiting Scotland and looking for cheap accommodation and great location.

Who thought I would ever enjoy working more than eating??--I think this meal was a first!\n\nI got steamed veggies and brown rice.  Now I expected it to be pretty bland, since it mentioned no sauces added at all.  But the vegetables were rubbery, not crisp like they should be after a good steaming. The rice was pretty underdone as well, so all-in-all, they got nothing right.  I tried adding some sauces to liven it up a bit, but it was too little, too late.\n\nPerhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup.  I usually add pepper to mine because I like the extra kick, but this needed much more help than a little pepper.  It was very bland, and didn't taste like anything.  Tasteless egg in water is definitely NOT something you want to keep eating.  And, of course, there was no salt and pepper on the table, so I couldn't even enjoy it the way I like. \n\nBecause I didn't pay, I didn't complain to the waiter, but normally this would not have passed by me.  Though the lunch prices are pretty reasonable, I still would not return here if given the choice.",0

Crispy Fish is my favorite. Tortillas, batter, and sauces are so yummy.\n\nMy only complaint is that sometimes with their style of service (you don't have one particular server, they all kind of split zones and help out), you end up telling multiple people \""""No, I don't need another refill\"""" or whatever the case is.

The breakfast was delicious with ample portions and for relatively affordable price about 7 bucks then 2 for the hotcake. Server was nice and checked in periodically - the wait staff that we interacted with were all friendly. While Deluca's is a diner and I expect some grease, I felt their floors were a little much as I had to make sure I wasn't sliding when walking out the door.

So I waited and waited and pretty much waited some more. \n\nOrder Numbers where all over the place. Order number 56, 48, 27, 57, 58, 69 etc.... It gets a bit frustrating when you think your next but in reality your not even close.  \n\nFinally I got my burger and sat down with my friends hoping for a delicious bite of a juicy burger.  My first bite was pretty much my last.  Figuring to buy a double it would be big enough to fill my appetite but that wasn't the case.  The burger was fresh but not that great in a taste category.  My milk shake was the thickest milk shake in the world.  It coated my throat with a chocolaty mess, which it ended up giving me a stomachache.  \n\nBy far the best thing to order was their french fries.  They are made from real potatoes and you can watch the fri-guy put the potatoes in a contraption and cut them up.  \n\nOther then crappy burgers and horrible milk shakes, I would hold off and not  waste your time just to get some decent fries.  Stick with paying a little extra and getting something better.  \n\nMy Vegas trip could have done with out In-N-Out.",0
2762,"Worst customer service. I have a iphone 5 that's been recalled because of the sleep/power button. \nI finished working across the street around 9:30 am so I figured I'd just come by and see if they would give me a new one quickly. \nI walk into the store. \nWalked over to the Genius Bar area and noticed a women working there with a red iPad. A guy that works there came up to me and asked what I was needing and I told him. He then said okay talk to the girl with the red iPad. She will take care of you. \n\nI was standing next to her when another customer, a woman walked in and walked right up to her. (She was assisting another customer). She told the customer to get in line behind her. \n\nOnce she was finished assisting the customer I walked a bit closer and she just ignored me and greeted the women who just walked in. \n\nMaybe because I wasn't directly behind the previous customer, in line?!???\n\nI just walked out. Such a shame, I don't have time during my day to schedule a appointment with the \""""genius bar\"""". I just need a new phone, mine is recalled. Pretty simple. \n\nBut fuck it. I just left.

2763,"Again, Great drinks, great service, great happy hours, and great style but I never have any luck with the food here. \n\nThis time the bread was not crunchy, it was stale. Appetizer FAIL.

2766,"Oh saffron what have you done. Ok firstly I have been going to saffron since they opened at their new location on craig. I like there lunch buffet but sadly I'm giving a bad review not because of the food but because of the lack of food during my last visit. \n\nI went in on Feb 14th at 2 pm I was seated quickly like I always am. We went to get some food and noticed almost everything was out. I assumed they would still be cooking since they closed at 2:30 and they usually just cook small portions and refill the food. However after 10 minutes I noticed that they weren't bringing anything out. I asked the server first about my water since I never got one then about the food. He said we're closing so no more food is cooking. I asked why no one would tell me this when I sat down and the server repeated that they close at 2:30. He said he would ask if anything else could be cooked and came back again stating they close at 2:30. \n\nI can't believe that after coming so often to eat that they wouldn't have the courtesy of letting me know that I would be paying full price for 6 pieces of cut up chicken and some rice. Maybe they should institute a last call or something of that nature. \n\nI actually loved coming here for lunch but ever since this happened I have been driving past saffron to go to Mt. Everest, Mint or Namaste depending on my mood.\n\nP.S please bring back the tandoori chicken to the lunch buffet. I am pretty sure this is the only lunch buffet in Vegas that doesn't have tandoori chicken available.",0

Slim pickings for dinner while inside TI.  Needed to conveniently get something to eat after our nap... which leads me to believe good quick food is relatively low supply in most of Vegas. \n\nI could maybe muster up 2.5 stars for this place to be fair, but I won't be back to eat pizza here for sure.

2770,"My friend and I have been avid nacho fans since the 7th grade. So on her last night out here visiting we decided to hit up Nacho Daddy and revel in the carbs. Plus, after depleting our bank accounts over the weekend a restaurant with a coupon is always good.\n\nFor starters we got the Raspberry Margarita. It actually had a real raspberry taste instead of just the artificial one. Very good! And we split two Nacho skillets with our buy one-get one deal. \n\nThe Thai Chicken Nachos came out first (they also brought a wrong order, but fixed it quickly and professionally) and they had a great flavor! I loved the Sweet Chili Sauce mixing in with the white queso-delicious! The majority of the toppings were just on top with some on bottom with many chips in between. We almost wanted more substance, but overall the chips were good.\n\nThe Buffalo Chicken Nachos were our second round, and by this time we were already stuffed! Although we were incredibly thankful they did not come out at the same time. We got to avoid the sogginess that happens when queso is involved. These nachos were also very good. The buffalo sauce was not overwhelming and had a really good flavor and it complemented the cheese well. The chicken was really breaded and a little to \""""fake chicken\"""" like for my taste but it tasted alright.\n\nOverall, great atmosphere for a nacho/pub joint. The place was clean, the service was friendly and the food was good. We came at the end of happy hour but they seem to have some great specials. Will I go back? Maybe, if other people want to go but I'm too much of a health nut to become a regular.",1

The belgian waffle was also cold by the time it came out... It had obviously sat in the window for a while while my food was bring prepared. \nThe good: fresh, hot coffee (they left the thermos pot on the table, which was nice), sausage links were fine, waffle was fine, my food was piping hot when it came out. \nThe total came to $26, which is more than the meal was worth, considering the poor quality of the breakfast food.",0

If you see a mostly full dining room and a line a few deep at the register be prepared to commit a good hour of your evening to the Wei dynasty. \n\nWhile waiting, try to get a seat facing the kitchen, which is in full view of the dining room; a dining room that is, in essence, a high school cafeteria in disguise.  (Don't be tempted to sit with the cool kids, it's a trap.  They'll only make fun of you.)  Facing the kitchen affords you a great entertainment option while you patiently wait for your food, because nothing is as wondrous as a fully-slammed, high volume kitchen.\n\nFour to five line cooks man the woks, flinging wire baskets of meats and vegetables back and forth in a juggling show the likes of which I haven't seen since the Flying Karamazov Brothers.

2786,"I dined here for the first time last week.  I was in town visiting some friends and family and went to this place with a large group.  i read the reviews here and thought this would be a great place to try. Especially with the $21 all-you-can-eat sushi for lunch.\n\nThe servers were prompt with taking our orders.  Our table was the second to place orders so I thought we would get great service...NOT!  I ordered a cucumber salad for an appetizer and three sushi rolls (rattlesnake roll, crunchy scallop and yellowtail trio).  Well,  it took OVER 30 minutes for my cucumber salad to arrive.  And I had to say something TWICE to the server before it came out.  By the time I got my appetizer just about everyone else in our group had already received and eaten their sushi rolls.  Why did my little cucumber salad take so long to arrive? Did they have to plant the seed and grow the cucumber?  My brother-in-law sitting next to me even got his sushi roll before I got my appetizer.  That was strike one!\n\nNow for strike two - I had to remind the server that I hadn't received my sushi rolls.  This was after everyone else was pretty much finished their rolls.  So even after I reminded him it still took another 25 minutes to get my rolls to me (Yes I was timing everything).\n\nStrike three - I get my sushi rolls. Luckily I wasn't dying of starvation because some others in our group were able to share their rolls so I was able to eat a few pieces while waiting for mine. One thing I noticed was that most of these specialty rolls had this stupid sweet chef's sauce drizzled all over. I don't mind this sauce as its great on dragon rolls.  But this caused everything to taste the EXACT same.  And this sauce was TOO SWEET.  It really killed the individual flavors of the fresh ingredients inside each roll.  My brother couldn't stomach it.  And when I finally got my rolls two of the rolls (crunchy scallop and rattlesnake) were DRENCHED with the sweet sauce.  And the yellowtail trio roll was nasty. It tasted sour like they marinated the fish in vinegar or something!\n\nIf you like sweet sushi rolls then this is the place for you.  However I will never set foot in this place again!",0
2787,"This place is a must if you're going to Vegas to do the classic \""""club/party/drink-all-night-with-friends\"""" thing on the strip. Or if you like sandwiches/food/life. Even if this place has a huge line, it moves fast and efficient. Just don't expect to easily find a place to sit and eat!\n\nThe condiments and toasting make the sandwich. They absolutely do. I'm usually not a fan of mixed deli meats in a sandwich, but I will ALWAYS, ALWAYS make an exception for the Full Montagu. The toasted swiss and cheddar cheese give the roast beef and turkey such a rich flavor, and the acidity of the deli mustard just cuts through the heavy flavors and tie the sandwich into a perfect little package.\n\nYou can do no wrong with the Original either; roast beef, cheddar, and horseradish sauce. The horseradish doesn't overpower the sandwich and is not too spicy - it just gives the sandwich a necessary kick. So good!\n\nNow, I usually LOVE this place and would gladly give it 5-stars, but my last trip was the first time I've ever been disappointed. The disappointment  was with their new side: Bacon Macaroni and Cheese. Don't get me wrong - the macaroni and cheese itself tasted wonderfully salty, rich, and cheesy. What disappointed me was the bacon part. I expected it would be a macaroni and cheese cooked with diced up bacon or something, but when I opened the container, it was 2 slices of bacon (same bacon from sandwiches) placed on top of the mac and cheese and then toasted. Now, I don't know if bacon was cooked with the macaroni (I didn't see any pieces), but it just seemed kind of a lazy attempt to bacon macaroni and cheese. \n\nBut I would definitely go back again.",1
2788,"I'm not exactly sure why, but Fiesta Burrito blows away the 'somebody-bertos' which are all over the valley.\n\nMy first clue that this place would be better than the average was seeing the fire truck and ambulance parked outside.

I was in the area and hit Fiesta Burrito. I got a carne asada burro and a plain cheese crisp. Even though the line of cars was six deep, the line moved smoothly and before I knew it, I was paying for my lunch.\n\nGetting back to the office, I was pleased to discover a tasty burro and the cheese crisp was very good.

The gauc was really fresh and a big hit at the table. We also got something with bits of fresh tuna and scallions glazed in o&o and citrus to be put on air crisped chips. I had the lobster and crab sliders along with the tomato bisque soup. The sandwich had big chunks of meat with a light mayo sauce mixture. The one thing I didn't like about the sandwich though was the extra third bread they added. (To much bread) I tried my friend's steak salad to which everything came fresh and the steak being tender and seared to a pink finish. I also tried the spaghetti bolognese. Thinking it would just taste like any bolognese, I was surprised to how different it was and it was pretty damn good as well. And they didn't overcook the pasta.

Most of these parrots, macaws and other exotics were donated or abandoned by long-time owners, and they are lonely and starving for human company. They love nothing more than having some random wannabe come up to their cages and sing to them. Seriously! On my two visits to this awesome place, I crooned endless Doris Day and Bing Crosby songs to a rapt audience of caged birds who cocked their heads, fixed their beady little eyes on me, and started bobbing up and down!

But I came across cartel coffee lab and had to check it out because of the stellar reviews!\n\nWhen I was ordering, I said I wanted a drink with the coolest design and the cashier kindly explained to me that although the designs are cool, that cartels main focus and goal is really on the taste of their coffee and how its made etc.. she recommended a cappuccino for me.\n\nOf course I received a lovely design on my drink, but she was right about the taste! It was so delicious. I've really only had starbucks coffee and the occasional dutch bros, but this place is really exceptional. Best coffee EVER.\n\nI swear I'd be here every day for my coffee fix if they had a drive thru!! lol:)",1
2802,"One of the biggest tourist traps around. Skip this overpriced crap and look for McDonald's in that one casino for cheap food, or a sit-down restaurant for a better value. $5.99 is apparently a \""""special\"""" price for two average (at best) slices of cheese pizza and a pretty small soda, and the rest of the menu is definitely overpriced.

2803,"The doctor we saw over the weekend prescribed the wrong medication for my very sick 7 year old!! Imagine my horror when I found out two days later when I took my child in to see our regular pediatrician on a Monday. One drug was way too strong for my child's weight. The other was an outdated drug doctors hardly ever prescribe anymore because there are newer, more effective drugs to treat the illness. And that prescribed drug is not even approved for children!!! Oh, and get this, the diagnosis/medications were given without a swab test to confirm the illness. I am so appalled and angry that my child was a victim of such terrible medical care.\n\nIt's too bad because I had a great experience with another doctor when I had come to get treated not too long ago. But it was a different doctor who seemed more familiar with current medical practices. \n\nBoth doctors I've experienced are retired and working part time at the clinic - that should tell you something about this clinic's hiring practices. If you have no where else to go but Urgent Care Extra, cross your fingers that you'll get a good retired doctor who has bothered to stay current with new medical/medicinal advancements!",0

Both articles of clothing were going to be ready on the same day. When I went to pick it up on Saturday morning, the young lady working informed me they didn't have the jacket. After about 30 minutes of describing the jacket, she calls what appears to be the owner. Then they DENY that I ever dropped off the jacket!!! I was furious!!!! I showed her my 2 claim receipts. She refused to acknowledge anything I had to say. I told her I was not leaving until they found my jacket! She started threatening me starting they had video cameras. This place is absolutely horrible! Worst experience of my life!!!!",0
2806,"Best pizza downtown. Hands down. Finally a pizza joint that rises above the rest. Pop Up Pizza is as artful as Pop Up Art House in Henderson. Think a hybrid between Neapolitan style and New York style. Exceptional ingredients that are perfectly portioned with the crust. Oh the crust, light, yet firm, a with a nice crunch on the edge yet soft and pillowy inside. The crust in the center holds up to the toppings with ease. By the slice, by the pie, heck buy the slice or buy the pie. Four styles to choose from with an additional 4 on the way in the next few weeks...including a vegan variety. An entiere pie will run you about $22, by the slice-$3.50 Pop Up Pizza is located on the south end of The Plaza, just as you enter the front door from Main St. Run, do not walk to this place. Soon the lines will be out the door, up Fremont Street, then all the way down Las Vegas Blvd to the Secret Pizza Place at the Cosmo. Yeah, it's that good.",1

2810,"This place is a disgrace to the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino. My daughter and I stopped for some lunch after going to the Shark Reef. I noticed that it was a little bit busy, so I asked the hostess how long would it take to get seated, because my daughter was hungry and fussy... she didn't say a word, took some menus and walked away, came back and told me she has a table now if I wanted it. Of course I was like, sure! I sat down ordered a glass of milk for my daughter, and a glass of water for that moment - because I didn't know what I wanted to drink yet, I ordered a plate of ribs and french fries in stead of the potato salad. About 40 mins later, no sight of the waitress, no manager, no busser, no hostess, a full episode of yo gabba gabba, the food runner comes out with the plate of ribs -- and of course the potato salad. I have nothing against the potato salad, I just wanted fries because my daughter loves fries... Anywho, the waitress comes and checks on me and asked me how I was doing, and i told her that I was disappointed from the wait and the lack of service, and to top it off no french fries, no refill on the water, and my daughter at this point just needed to go back to the hotel and sleep. She totally flipped out on me saying that its not her fault, that if I don't want to pay for it I should've just told her, and if I wanted to talk to the manager she can go get him for me -- OMFG really?! The manager comes over and totally gives me a run down of what was going on in his place, saying that on a normal day he'd make around 10K and that day they made 15K because of that the service was a bit slower -- SO--- what he was saying was that they made money, met their quota and can care less if their waitress goes off on a customer?! He offered me a free mojito or a bloody mary - ok, I'm not going to drink and drive with my child THANKS but NO THANKS. What a horrible experience that was. I've always enjoyed the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, but they really need to re-staff or re-train those people running that place they would like to call an establishment.",0
2811,"KUNG FU KICKED TO 2 STARS\n\n   Kung Fu Restaurant broke an important rule. That rule is to NEVER EVER force your customers to leave a minute after giving them the check. Breaking this rule has consequences such as A ONE STAR REDUCTION IN A REVIEW RATING. As a result of their unprofessional action a 3.4 rating is dropped to 2.4 stars that is rounded off to 2 stars. Yikes! kind of how my brother and I also felt. In all honesty this a gentle response considering that many talented Yelper's would reward this experience with a one star rating. \n\n  Kung Fu Restaurant is located in the Las Vegas Chinatown District at the southwest corner of Valley View and Spring Mountain Boulevard. After a day in Springs Preserve suffering with a hurt left foot my brother and I decided to drive a few traffic lights South on Valley View Boulevard to Chinatown. This would be a convenient choice. Actually not really. Regardless that Kung Fu is at a major crossroads, the parking situation is atrocious. The diminutive parking spaces are more ideal for a golf cart than today's modern vehicles. I'd sacrifice my car if I left it there. So, we parked across Valley View Boulevard near Starbuck's with the intention of a post dinner coffee after. So I'd sacrifice my legs and limbs crossing a busy Valley View Boulevard.\n\n  The service started out allright. Immediately after walking inside there was a booth available (I wonder why). The waiter presented my brother and I with glasses of cold water and the menus. \n\n  Regardless that there was a large assortment of dishes to choose from, only the entree page dishes included jasmine rice. Nothing about brown or fried rice. I ordered the shrimp chop suey which was around $9.50. My taste buds say that the shrimp chop suey is 3.4 stars. In comparison to the Chinese restaurants that I have reviewed (my Chinese Restaurants list is the home of these reviews) the size of the shrimps trailed in comparison. Generally speaking, or tasting the quality from the vegetables to the sauce tasted fine. The soy sauce gave some taste to the jasmine rice.  With the shrimp chop suey and jasmine rice, I ordered hot tea. In my opinion it is nearly impossible to mess up the delicious hot tea that Chinese restaurants serve. After a few cups of the delicious green tea, I stand by my opinion. Thanks to the Yelp checkin offer, the tea was complimentary. I would of enjoyed a bowl of my beloved wonton soup,  one of my favorite foods in the world going back to my toddlerhood. But Kung Fu doesn't give any breaks with the soup. The war won ton soup is around $9. they ought to include personal portions of soup on the menu. Then again, they ought to include chopsticks on the table. \n\n  The food was good. I ate everything down to the plate including the sauce. My brother and I were talking at the time the waiter presented us with the check. Around a minute later the waiter tells us to pay because people were waiting for the booth. He wasn't giving us the stink eye and handed us our fortune cookies. Without a nasty demeanor he just rushing us out of the booth barely giving my brother and I time to split the bill. \n\n  I didn't read the fortune cookie. An appropriate fortune cookie would say something like, \""""The average person tells nine other people when they are unhappy with a business where the average Yelper tells a couple thousand people when they are unhappy with a business.\"""" Or the fortune cookie might of said, \""""You have a World of restaurants to choose from in your city.\"""" Or the fortune cookie could of said, \""""There is nothing like competition.\"""" To close off this review, what I am saying is that Kung Fu rushed us out the door of their restaurant and it is a door I don't intend to open in a long time.",0
2812,"It is clear that this restaurant knows nothing about service.   The young servers just stand and gossip while their tables, presumably, rot.  You sit at the sushi bar and they bring you your menu, bring you ONE drink and disappear for the rest of the night-no plate pick-up or drink reorders. As for the chefs, one is good, but the others are so SLOW at making their rolls.  They need to learn to alternate between sushi bar customers so everyone has at least one roll to eat while they begin at the top again...you know? At present, it is often that each whole party gets All of their rolls before another party gets even one. So if all the seats are taken at the bar, at least one set of guests won't get one morsel for a half-hour. And then you will get all of it at once. If service is important, forget this restaurant.

2814,"Came here for brunch twice the last time I was in Vegas. I heard a lot of good things about Wicked Spoon, and this buffet met my expectations! In general, the quality of the food is a lot better than those at other buffets.\n\nBrunch Monday-Friday is $22 w/ a complimentary glass of bloody mary, mimosa, or champagne. Brunch on Saturday-Sunday is $29, and $37 w/ unlimited bloody mary, mimosa, and champagne. I also noticed they offer takeout for $20.\n\nWhile the selection isn't huge for brunch, there's still enough variety of food to get full off of. Some of the highlights for me were the Eggs Benedict (ham or bacon, depending on the day), Grilled Salmon, and charcuterie station. Even after days of being back from Vegas, I'm still craving the Eggs Benedict!\n\nThe dessert station is amazing--I couldn't try everything, but the ones I ate tasted good. The pistachio and salted caramel gelatos were yummy! I also really liked the pecan tart.\n\nService isn't very good here when it's crowded. Our waiter only stopped by a couple times to check on us, so I didn't even get any refills on my drinks.\n\nI will definitely try to go back to Wicked Spoon the next time I'm in Vegas. I would recommend going on weekdays because it's well worth the money and also a lot less crowded. The $29 brunch seemed a bit pricey to me, but I was willing to pay for it given the quality of the food.",1

They also have a few nontraditional Thai dishes like Orange chicken and Beef with Broccoli in case your with someone that is not a fan of Thai cuisine. \n\nHeat levels are somewhat conservative so you may need to order a little hotter than at other locations. Service is friendly and quick.  Their prices are very reasonable and their portions are on the larger size, so you can share with someone if you choose to.",1

2821,"The apartment is okay - it should be, it's on the higher end of pricing in this market. \n\nThe pools are nice and reasonably well maintained but not really suitable for lap swimming. \n\nThe company claims to have (1) a business center with multiple work stations and (2) a java bar as amenities. They are so bad that this basically constitutes a flat-out lie. \n\nThe \""""business center with multiple work stations\"""" is two small rooms open during office business hours - so it's useless if you, say, come home from work at 6 and want to use the business center to print something out. That'd be okay, though, if the computers actually worked. They are terrible, dated, slow machines that are practically useless. At least half the time, they literally don't work (which is tough luck for a lot of residents, as there seem to always be residents there *trying* to use the machines). When I say \""""don't work,\"""" I don't mean they are slow - I mean they literally do not work (the screen won't turn on, the keyboard doesn't work, etc). When they work, they are slow and filled with old, insecure software like ancient versions of internet explorer. Don't access anything private on them. \n\nThe java bar is a single keurig machine with extremely low-stocked supplies and virtually no variety. It's located in the middle of the leasing office, which makes it kind of weird if you actually do want to use it - you have to randomly go in someone's office and use their stuff. If it were really intended for resident use and benefit, it'd be located 10 feet away in the resident's clubhouse. \n\nMy two star review is based on the fact that the management company lies about amenities and thinks its okay to do that. Living here is fine (other than the falsely advertised amenities), but for the money you may as well go to one of the much nicer Ovation properties. (No, I don't work for ovation. I'm just sick of attempting to use the Mosaic \""""amenities\"""" to print something and not being able to because the machines and maintenance are horribly bad).",0

When we arrived we were promptly seated and the waitress came by at took our drink order. We all ordered water and then ordered our meals.\n\nWe were then IGNORED for 45+ minutes while we waited for our food. No check ups by the waitress, no I am sorry your food is taking so long. hey do you need a refill, no nothing. At that point since we were out of time and had to get back to the office so we got up to leave. That is when we were finally noticed. The waitress came running over almost freaking out  saying our food is just about ready. Where were you 20 minutes ago?\n\nAnyway one guy in my party had guilt over leaving and paid for the whole order to go. I disagree that he should of done that since we were not into them for anything because we were all drinking water but that was his choice.\n\nI understand that sometimes freshly made food takes a bit longer when its prepared fresh, but not 40 minutes. but there is no excuse to ignore someone for that amount of time.\n\nP.S. In response to the owner's comments, I stand by what I said in my review as accurate. So based on what the owner says, good customer service is to call me a liar, write a snarky insincere response, and rally against yelp and other review sites complaining about how unfair they are?  I have read all the owner's comments left towards other Yelpers and there is a consistent theme throughout them. If something goes wrong during your visit, don't blame the restaurant. Not a very productive response in my opinion. I think highly of yelp as yet another tool for consumers to made educated decisions about where to spend their hard earned money. It is also good for businesses that go above and beyond because they will always be rewarded with my repeat business.",0

Macaroni salad was not as garlicy but yummy nonetheless. Ordered Spam Musubi and there was only one and the spam was more thinly sliced than what I'm use to.They didn't even have the thick teriyaki sauce:( nor the garlic chili sriracha/simbal.

2835,"When I go to Vegas, I am there to visit family and enjoy some gambling and food.  I stay and play like a local, so I prefer to spend my time and money Downtown.  The Strip is great for tourists, people who like to party and families with kids, but I am none of those, so I don't miss the glitz and glamour of The Strip.\n\nMy favorite upscale restaurant to eat at (and I eat there at least once every visit) is Second Street Grill inside The Fremont Hotel.  It is a Pan-Asian steakhouse with lots of great seafood and steak.  It is a little hard for wheelchairs to get in and out, but they will work with you to make sure everyone is comfortable.  The ambience is classy with low-lighting and the casino noise is pretty much nil (until someone opens the door and even then it's not bad).  The service is usually great (They have occasional slammed-busy nights) and the busboys, waitstaff and hostesses do a great job.\n\nI love the food here - not only is the presentation nice, but the choices are varied and quality is excellent.  There are a few dishes that I have not liked as much as others, but that happens and it's subjective.\n\nAppetizers are big and can be shared between 2 people - I highly suggest the caprese salad ((Fresh tomato slices, chopped basil, balsamic vinegar and beautiful fresh mozzarella cheese), the soft-shell crabs (Crispy and tender and so flavorful!),  the Peking duck tacos (A little messy, but so yummy!) or the sashimi (Super fresh and delicious).  The shrimp cocktail is also really good with gigantic tiger prawns cooked to tenderness (not rubbery and over-cooked) served with a really good cocktail sauce.\n\nFor entrees, the steaks are always good - the filet mignon is tender and flavorful and the New York and Ribeye steaks are big and meaty.  The pork is thick and juicy and the whole fish is really tender and a great presentation.  The only entree I have had where I was disappointed has been the Tempura -- The batter was thick and heavy and I didn't care for it.\n\nOne of my favorite entrees is the lobster tail.  The lobster tails are HUGE - I am talking the meat, out of the shell is gigantic.  Not only is the lobster huge, it tastes great and they will remove it from the shell for you if you ask them to.  The drawn butter is served over a candle to stay warm and melted throughout the meal.\n\nThe desserts here are really good.  They have changed them recently, so the creme brulee is no longer available, but the ice cream is always good!\n\nThis place is not cheap, but it is completely worth the money to get away from the noise of Las Vegas and enjoy an intimate and fabulous meal.

We had to wait 15 minutes just for 2 for drinks! Medium Rare does not mean raw. We should have sent this back but were in a hurry to get to a show. No wonder there was no wait at 9pm on a Saturday night. There's just way to many places to go that are better quality. They did a fun table-side salad presentation.

2839,"Arriving late to Pittsburgh, I decided to make dinner easy by just going to the Fairmount's in-house restaurant, Habitat.  I went in with high hopes based on the descriptions on the menu, but was sorely disappointed by the meal.  I started off with the Bourbon Meringue cocktail, which I thought was going to be a mistake when I ordered it, but my curiosity got the best of me.  I can't honestly say I hated it, but I didn't like it either.  It was just weird.  I followed that up with a Manhattan, which is pretty tough to mess up.  It was basically a bit of bourbon and what tasted and looked like cherry grenadine.  It had a weird bright reddish color to it and places in the bottom end of Manhattans I've had in my life.\n\nFor the food, I started with the roasted beet salad, basically some chunks of beet, chunks of goat cheese and a couple pieces of frisee.  The taste was fine, I suppose, but there was no finesse to the dish and the goat cheese was largely flavorless.  For my entree, I went with the Honey Glazed Duck, described as follows: \""""Duck confit and goat cheese puff, wilted arugula, pear, pur\u00e9e of carrot and orange.\""""  I ordered it at the suggested temp of medium-rare.  I can honestly say it was the worst duck I've ever had at an upscale restaurant (as opposed to duck in a take-out Thai dish).  It was not medium-rare.  It was rare, if not blue.  It lacked the crispy skin that makes duck so wonderful.  And it lacked flavor.  The puree was hardly edible as it was barely present on the plate.  Despite all these missteps, the worst part of the plate was easily the \""""puff.\""""  When I think \""""puff,\"""" I think light, airy, flaky.  This was heavy, dense, compact.  I think there was a crumble of goat cheese in it.  I will say, though, that my side of Brussels sprouts were good.\n\nNow, to be completely fair, my server was attentive and receptive to me when I told her about the problems with the dish, which I usually don't do even when I don't like something in a restaurant.  The duck was taken off the bill without any fuss, which was not my goal in pointing out how undercooked it was.  I also didn't give them a chance to take another shot at it, which might have changed things.  Every kitchen has a bad dish now and then.  This was one experience on one night, but I thought it worth sharing.",0

I felt it was overpriced because of the lack of variety and quality in comparison to their regular breakfast buffet.",0
2845,"When you walk through the door you're greeted with an amazing smell (reminded me of when my dad would cook meat in our smoker with apple wood chips when we were kids). Second was how great the restaurant looked, it was clean and inviting. The bartender smiled and waved at us like we were old friends and told us to have a seat anywhere...(time was 12:22)\n\nSo far we're off to a great start. So what possibly could have went wrong to cause a 2 star review? Our service. \n\nThe bartender brought us over some menus and explained that we could order brunch or lunch, brought us some chips and salsa, then went back to the bar, we didn't see any other server in the restaurant so for a while we thought she was just ignoring us. So we sat and sat and sat waiting for our actual server to come by. Keep in mind there were 3 other tables in the restaurant, one was just leaving so we'll call it two. \n\nLet's touch on the chips and salsa. I loved the chips, they were fantastic, however, the salsa was not a \""""dipping salsa\"""" it had a wonderful flavor and would have been great on a taco salad (why don't you have taco salads?) or poured on the top of a burrito but it was horrible for dipping chips. There were NO chunks, it was the consistency of hot sauce. \n\nFinally our server greeted us with her presence, she walked up and didn't say \""""Hi, I'm so-and-so, I'll be taking care of you folks today\"""" or \""""Welcome to Lenero, have you been here before\"""" or even just \""""hello\"""" instead she said \""""what can I get you to drink\"""". I almost responded with an \""""hi, I'm fine thank you for asking\"""" but I refrained. We ordered our drinks and I asked for an order of guacamole, it's 12:31 at this point (9 min after walking in the door). \n\nThere we sat, bored with our chips and salsa, read every yelp review of Lenero, discussed our plans for rest of the day etc. Our server finally came by to ask if we were ready to order. Not by asking if we were ready or if we had any questions. She walked up and in her snotty tone said \""""what do you want\"""". Seriously?? That's not how you talk to someone! I was so taken aback by her attitude I decided right then and there we will not be back. This food would have to be sent straight from the Heavens for it to tip the scales back in the favor of the restaurant. \n\nI ordered the chicken tacos and my bf ordered the enchiladas. As she was walking away he mentioned to her we're still waiting on our guac, it's been over 10 min at this point. She seemed surprised by our request to get the guacamole, almost like she just plain forgot I even ordered it. \n\nFinally our guacamole came. TWENTY-ONE minutes after ordering it. By this time the appeal of chips and guac was completely gone. She gave a million excuses about how there were steaks that needed to be cooked and the cook is extremely busy. The only other table in the place had already gotten their food and was about to leave. That left one table of folks. You're telling me the cook couldn't manage to toss some guacamole together because he was too busy making steaks for the one table in the restaurant? She told us it was on the house. That was nice but I would have rather of paid for it and have received it 16 min ago. \n\nFinally the bartender came over to apologize for the guacamole taking so long and explained that the cook is new and he went in order of the tickets arriving and needed to prepare the food for the OWNER'S FAMILY first. So I've been sitting here hungry because the owner needed to eat and that took priority? \n\nOur lunch came out pretty fast and my tacos were good, what the menu doesn't mention is they are street tacos, not normal sized ones. Which was fine by me but I could see where someone else wouldn't have been impressed with 4 really small tacos. The enchilada was also good but the menu should clarify it is a spicy dish. While we both love spice, again I can see how someone else would not have liked it. If my mom had ordered it she wouldn't have been able to eat it, the dish was that spicy. \n\nBottom line is we do not have any intentions on coming back. While the food was good, it wasn't phenomenal. The salsa was not ideal for \""""chips and salsa\"""" and the service was HORRIBLE. It's been a long time since I've had a server that snobby. She should be really lucky we left her 20% because she certainly did not deserve it (I'm having tipper's regret).",0
2846,"Dear Bluephies,\n\nIt's on again! Brunch that is.....\n\nI have an on again, off again relationship with this place, and I have come to the realization that I can only love you in the summer.... Ok, you ARE my summer fling! From your gorgeous mounds of fresh advocado, your perky little tomato chunks, and sensual mushrooms tenderyly mashed up in that advocado EggSTRAVAGANZA!  And then there's your beignets - plump little funnel cakes of heaven (I don't even have to wait for the fairs!). AND THEN you actually have a voluptuous portion of breakfast potatoes with a savory cajun spice (here spice reads - decently salted, not hot). \n\nBut, by far, the best reason you should come for Brunch is the BLOOD MARY's. They pride themselves (for good reason) as being a Vodkatorium. Which means they got great bloody's! Bloody Maria, Fat Boy, plain - they all have a nice consistancy (not too much alcohol to be runny, and not overdone with the mix to be too thick), outlandish garnish (a Scottish EGG!?, bacon, tater tots?!), and they do \""""flights\"""" of 3 bloody's! Impressive and yummy I take a point off of them (in relation to other bloody's in town) b/c they do use a premix (Zing -Zangs?). However, they compensate by adding good flavored vodkas (they have BACON vodka people!) \n\nBonus: they also have gluten free options, are pretty helpful with allergy \""""stuff\"""", and the dinners aren't bad either (my favorite is Trout with Pearl Cous cous - YUM, the chick salad croissant is just average, even though it sounds grand, and everyone likes the burgers.)",1

2852,"My grandparents came into town from Florida and wanted to go to dinner. Their absolute favorite food is seafood and being that they live in a place where great seafood is available everywhere, I wanted to take them someplace that would not disappoint. Anytime I have ever asked anyone where to get good seafood at in Arizona, the answer has always been The Salt Cellar.  \n\nI want to start off by saying the service staff in every aspect was stellar.  We showed up with one more person than we had anticipated and the hostesses were quick to make the last minute accommodation. The ladies in your bar were so sweet, and our server was amazing. \n\nIn regards to the food, my sister and I ordered oysters on the half shell, which were the best we have ever had. My mom got the crab stuffed shrimp and really enjoyed it. My sister and I also split the crab legs and filet. Unfortunately, this is where things take a different direction.  Crab legs were great, but the medium filet was not seasoned at all and was chewy.  My fifteen year old son got the filet and shrimp.  He liked the shrimp, but said the steak was not good, and he usually likes, and will pretty much eat everything with no complaints. My grandfather's fish was overcooked, and my grandmother's fried shrimp was soggy.  We had cold veggies on our plates that tasted like they were warm at one time, but had sat out for quite awhile.  \n\nLet me just say, money is not the issue here.  Our bill was 317 dollars after tip, for an average of about 53 dollars per person. Totally reasonable for a great meal. When it comes to amazing food, service and atmosphere I would pay double that.  I do realize this is a seafood restaurant, however for the amount of money that is being charged I would expect to leave feeling that EVERYTHING was amazing.  I originally thought about going to The Keg which is similarly priced. I have ordered different steak and seafood dishes there many times and each time said to my husband, \""""Oh my God. I loved every part of that dinner!\"""" However, I wanted to take my grandparents to a local restaurant and not a chain restaurant that they could go to anytime in Florida. After hearing the great things about this restaurant, I decided to take a chance and go here instead. I was honestly SO surprisingly disappointed and to be frank, embarrassed that I suggested it. It was just, eh. Everyone left saying \""""It was ok, but not great.\"""" My mom and sister who also live here said it was totally not what they had expected. \n\nI did not want to tell the server about this in front of my whole family when he asked how everything was, not to mention we were in a hurry and could not have had our dinners remade at that time had they offered. So I decided to return home and email the manager. In her response she just proceeded to tell me that the issue is their food supplier and not the preparation. She made absolutely no attempts to regain our service. I would have given this restaurant at least three stars but after receiving her reply bumped it down to a 1.",0

2866,"Do not let the PF Chang's ownership fool you into believing their cuisine is any better than Panda Express. Essentially it's the same thing but at a higher price and slower service. And with Panda setting the bar very low for Chinese food,  Pei Wei is subterranean on the quality scale. \n\nSpecifically, the dishes are extremely salty, way too sweet and greasy. Yes, that's the definition of American cooking. But it still sucks. And rounding out their Americana - they deep fry the Kung Pow'ed chicken. I guess with a few token snow peas mixed with the fried rice, this fast food appears more Hoity-Toity than a Swanson Oriental TV Dinner from Walmart, but don't be fooled by marketing and mid-range pricing.",0
2867,"I had this just yesterday. It was late at night and we were craving Chinese food but didn't want the typical Panda Express. So, I asked Siri to find me a Chinese place and because of the 4 stars we decided to give it a shot. The food was delicious! It was brought out in a timely manner and the staff was very nice! Overall we are definitely going back.:)",1
2868,"This event is over-hyped and is nothing but a hipster infestation.\n\nThe amount of galleries to look at aren't much, and half of them have a snobby feel to them. Some of the street vendors can be like this as well.\n\nParking is absolute hell, and you must park far away from the event. It will take a while to even find parking since downtown is so convoluted.\n\nHowever, a tip is to park at the Las Vegas Academy student parking area. You won't get towed for this. Besides, there's some students present who have to stay late a night for theatre rehearsals. Plus, LVA itself promotes First Friday to its students (particularly the 'art majors'), so feel free to park at LVA if you don't mind walking a bit to the event.\n\nThe food sold at First Friday is overpriced, although they do have very good funnel cakes. Still though, I suggest you save money and eat at any of the nearby restaurants instead. You get more bang for your buck that way.\n\nConsidering the type of event First Friday is, you'll find all sorts of people dressed in eccentric fashion. It's got everything from goths to rockabilly chicks. It's a great place to go people watching and even get some photo ops.\n\nRegardless, First Friday still has a lot to improve upon as Vegas's local 'arts scene'. We really don't have much culture here at all, so things like this are essential to keeping the arts alive.",0
2869,"Pizzeria at The Cosmopolitan nails my very favorite kind of pizza. It's slices as big as your head in New York fashion but the crust is thin and crispy the way I lurve it instead of doughy and chewy. I had my own slice of white pie that I gobbled up so fast Sir Nicholas barely had time to ask if he could have a bite to try it. But, he managed to squeeze in his request. And since he sampled a bite of my slice it was only fair he gave me a bit of his pepperoni, which I enjoyed just as much as my own.\n\nThere are like 4 seats inside here so you're probably taking your pie somewhere else to eat it. But, you can play old school video games while you wait like Galaga so that's pretty sweet.\n\nThey also sell a few beers and wines next to the sodas, but we went with Orange Fanta all the way when we stopped in for sustenance. \n\nPeople working here are fast and friendly and this is a great place to stop in for quick, easy eats before you head off to the next run of good fortune, shopping, or general merrymaking in Vegas.",1
2870,"4.5 stars\n\nI was hesitant to try this place given some of the early reviews, but I was hoping the new owners would make a go of it where several others have failed so we decided to give it a try tonight.  I'm so glad I did.\n\nWe were seated promptly--it was not busy--and our hostess asked if it was our first visit.  When we said yes, she explained some things about the food, the menu, and the restaurant.  She then left and got our iced teas.\n\nI ordered the new pollo con mole which is not the chicken listed on their online menu.  They recently replace the pollo limon with the pollo mole.  My wife ordered the pork Yucatan pibil.  With the meals came a soup or salad and we both got the black bean soup.  It had an excellent flavor, but there was one thing missing.  The soup is pureed black beans and I would have liked some chopped or whole beans for texture.  Still, it was very tasty.\n\nOur main dishes were excellent!  The mole on my chicken was rich and had great flavors.  I liked it because it wasn't heavy on the chocolate which I find with some restaurants.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed her pork Yucatan.  Portions were large enough we each could have brought some home for lunch tomorrow, but I, of course, pigged out and ate all of my chicken.\n\nFor dessert, we shared--sort of--a large piece of tres leches cake.  Yelpers note: with a check in and the purchase of an entree, you get a dessert.  They also have free wifi.\n\nService was excellent all night.  The manager came over and spoke with us about our dinners, and our iced tea was always refilled promptly.  \n\nI am so glad I gave Baja California a chance.  We will be back!",1
2871,"Great place for any Las Vegas virgins like my girlfriend and I. Stayed there this past weekend and LOVED IT!!  We did the check in at the airport and  avoided the long lines at the mgm  lobby. I read as many reviews as I could in the 70 days  before our trip so I knew exactly what to expect. Some of the idiots on here shouldve done the same thing and maybe they wouldn't be bitching about stupid little things like \""""omg  the TV in our room wasn't a flat screen!!, OMG we did not have  a coffee maker in our room!!! OMG the water pressure in the bathroom  was weak(turn the knob idiot)!! OMG  we were at the very edge of the strip.\""""  Hey MORONS, that's what websites like this one and trip advisor are for.  Quit complaining because you were too stupid to research your trip...\n The rooms were perfectly acceptable. Average size, comfy bed, great view of strip if you ask nicely. We  were lucky enough to  get a room on the 21st floor, next to our friends so no complaints about that.  Reception  on TV was sub par but who's watching TV in Vegas? Casino is really nice and you can hardly smell the smoke. AS previous reviews have stated, casino has a nice perfume to cover smell up. Dining options are a plenty, from $$$$-$. So if you lose tons of money like I did, there is always McDonald's:) \nPool area is overrated.  A bunch of douche bag drunks when I was there and the pool had a disgusting layer of suntan lotion floating above it at all times(In directors pool at least).  Weather was nice but pool needed to be 100 times colder  then the nasty luke warm  temp it was on my one and only trip down there(nice little walk btw)...\n You should def try to catch Ka if you are there(awesome awesome show) you will be amazed!! The theater itself is really cool and not a bad seat in the house.  Oh and here is a tip, If you are on a high floor and the elevator lobby is full, go through the double doors towards the back and get on the elevator that goes to the penthouse because its usually empty.  When you're checking out, get on  an elevator going up instead of down as those will probably be jammed with idiots by the time they get to you. \nWe did have an issue with cleaning staff as I overflowed the john, they took a while to get there and then never cleaned up the mess from the water. No biggy though as we had friends across the way:)  Walls are paper thin though so be aware because you could here your neighbors and vice versa pretty damn good if you are trying to sleep. If you  pass out then I guess it doesn't matter:).... Overall  GREAT HOTEL AND CASINO!!! I did not try the buffet but will try it on my next trip. Fat Tuesday was awesome and you should def visit it 5 or 6 times while you are there!",1
2872,Normally I love this place but today management failed. They were understaffed to a criminal degree which is bad for employees and patrons. Its not like the Derby came as a surprise.\n\nNever coming back for a special event here. I did go to the 7th St and Union Hills location for Preakness and had a MUCH better experience. Get your act together on 16th St and I could be persuaded to try again.,0
2873,After getting an express car wash my windows were all scratched up. It was a long deep scratch in my passenger's window which was extremely noticeable. I was disappointed in the service because I thought it was going to be great due to the reviews. I think it was the cloth they used to wipe down my car afterwards that ruined my windows. There was a soap stain down the side of my car. Absolutely disappointing. They rushed the wiping of the car.,0
2874,Not a JCPenney customer- but I have been following the news about the total image change for the store. Every Day low prices and really liked the last ad booklet in the sunday paper. Well- upon arriving at the store- there was very limited sizes- not the color selection as advertised- I was planning on a major shoping spree for spring- needless to say- when I finally found a sales associate she suggested that I look at the merchandise in petites or womans sizes? Really?? I am 5'9'' and a size 10. So I left-only bought 2 shirts - JCP definitely need better distribution of merchandise (size and colors) to the stores.. or more saavy buyers! Oh- and when I asked if the merchandise was back ordered- the associate had no idea what that meant!,0
2875,"I have been to this location 3 times for lunch and dinner in addition to the original in Brooklyn. My expectations of a restaurant start with how long it takes to get seated, how long it takes before we are greeted by our waitress, how long it takes to get our food and if our waitress follows up with how are meal is and if are drinks are full. In my opinion, Grimaldi's surpasses all expectations.\nThis particular restaurant is great and this is why.\n\n1. Staff was prompt and friendly\n2. Food is amazing and love the decor\n3. Management came to our table on more than one occasion to see if we were   enjoying our food and if we needed anything. It had a family feel as if your grandmother was making sure you were taken care of.\n\nMy wife and I get our pizza with pepperoni and extra basil, it is simply fantastic but the plain cheese and basil is more that satisfactory. get the large, it is only $2 more. We make sure to go here every time we visit Las Vegas. One last thing that made me enjoy this restaurant even more. There was an older couple next to us that looked as if they were from Duck Dynasty or some other hillbilly lifestyle. They were basically old school Vegas and I thought it was fantastic that this nice restaurant was a place of diversity where you can see a redneck, someone in a suit or a family. Great food is for all to enjoy.",1
2876,"The first time I was there (a few months ago), I received very good service (4 stars). They gladly took care of a whole bunch of stuff (some identified by me, some by them and some by the computer) covered under warranty and provided a complimentary loaner vehicle. \n\nHowever, I have to deduct 2 stars because I was misinformed this past weekend and it cost me $500 that I should not have had to spend!!! \n\nI called them about my serpentine drive belt that started to unravel while I was on the road in the East Valley. They said the belt falls under the maintenance category which is warrantied up to 50k miles. I have 53k; therefore, I'm not covered. To have them repair it, it would cost $500. In a bind, I quickly called my trusted local shop and they said it'd be $200 so I figured the choice was easy and drove down to them. On my way over, the belt had unraveled so much that it wrapped around the power steering pulley so I lost power steering (which cost me an additional $300 to fix). \n\nFast forward to today, I'm at Chapman on Camelback for an unrelated issue. I mention to my SA what happened over the weekend and he said it would have been covered under my manufacturer warranty of 55k miles which I still qualify for and the belt normally lasts til at least 100k miles. WTF!\n\nI am now waiting to hear back from Chapman on Camelback as to whether or not they are going to reimburse me for the $500 that I spent all because I was misinformed by Chandler. I gave my SA a copy of the invoice and I just found a BMW bulletin online regarding this issue so I'm really hoping they do the right thing.",0
2877,"This is the neighborhood Foodland that has the bare necessities needed to sustain a pantry or for when the next snowstorm of the century is a day away and you only have minutes to get TP, bread and milk. \n\nThe bakery here is tops, small selection, but really well made specialities. Huge brownies, iced and moist. They are easily 5 inch squares,  topped with things like Oreo cookies, nuts, sprinkles, and other yummy delights. The best thing I found is the individual pineapple upside-down cakes. Perfect for one person, these are just like the big ones, same buttery cake, same crunchy edges from the brown sugar melting as it bakes, and that almost candied pineapple that has bece one of my favorite desserts of all time.\n\nTry the foccacia dripping with evoo, fresh basil and tomatoes and mozzarella cheese, you'll never buy pizzeria pizza ever again. Take a few home and pop them in the oven and enjoy. \n\nI come here when I need the staples of the pantry like eggs, milk, even a pound of ground beef. The deli isn't the greatest but it will do in a pinch. Good rotisserie chickens too.",1
2878,"The prices on the menu outside almost scared me off, but they were just dinner specials. I ended up getting the canons burg burger, being a fan of buffalo sauce and bleu cheese. It was the best bleu cheese burger I've had in my life. And the fries- they give you so many fries, you have to dig out your burger from under them. All for a price of about $11. I was very impressed, will recommend to friends, and plan to come back.",1
2879,"I go to fast food places everyday of the week since I do not have kids. I must go to Long Johns twice a year...so this was Tue, 6:30pm, I go to their drive thru, and order a Cod and shrimp basket from the ad that was up on their board. They do not have it. So I try and order an L1, which consists of fish and shrimp. They inform me they do not have shrimp...kinda like going to burger king and they do not have burgers, or mcd and they cannot make me a number 1, big mac meal....i understand they might be out of cod, since it's their special, but the sign was up and it wasnt even that late...anyway, i wont be back. I should have read the other reviews before even wasting my time.",0
2880,"Came here for a work lunch on a Tuesday.  Six of in all, with four us early and two a bit later.  I had to get back for a 13:00 meeting and told the waiter as much, but still didn't get out on time because they were struggling with the bill - funny, as there were only about a dozen people in the whole restaurant!  Smoked sausage sandwich was OK; nothing spectacular but OK.  We did get the fried pickles as an appetizer and enjoyed them.  OK for a work lunch, with reasonable prices, but waitstaff really disappoints.",0
2881,"The Griddle has a HUGE menu, so be prepared for that when you arrive.  My friends and I dined on a Sunday evening and had no problem walking up to get a table.  There's not a TON of variety anywhere on the menu except the pancakes.  The dining room is comfortable and really cuts off the casino floor noise, despite being directly next to it.  My friends and I ordered a mix of breakfast (omelette) and lunch/dinner (fish tacos and shrimp pesto sandwich) items and were definitely satisfied.  The only thing I would have enjoyed is more flavor in the omelette and accompanying breakfast potatoes.  Our server seemed a bit off her game, but we all have off days, so we wrote that off.  If you're looking for a unique dining experience in a Strip casino, check out The Griddle.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed!",1
2882,"The only place I visited in Vegas that I'd like to buy a condo.  The staff here... unbeleivable.\n\nA short story... WHile waiting in the lobby for a vendor to join me for dinner a guest and his yappy dog came in the front door walking towards the elevator.\n\nAs soon as the dog hit the (presumably very expensive) carpet it drug his face the whole way.\n\nWhere as I would have hung the dog by his collar the bellhop and receptionist smiled accomodatingly.\n\nLots of kids and pets in the 20 minutes or so I was there.\n\nThe bar tender was more interested in talking with the attractive female staff though.\n\nOh, the gift shop has very cool things and they aren't over priced (which shocked me).",0
2883,Wasn't like it used to be. I had the nutella crepe. It was crispy instead of soft and pillowy. I'm surprised to say that there was too much nutella to crepe ratio. Banana was fresh. Whipped cream was awesome as before. It's not the same as it used to be.,0
2884,"This funky little eatery in the South End has grown quite a bit (not in size, but in appeal) over the last few years.  What started as not much more than a rather ugly yellow cinder block building on an oddly-shaped lot is now that and more - they've added some landscaping, a paved lot instead of the gravel parking and a nice outdoor eating area too.  Inside the food is the same great, simple combinations you're used to getting.\n\nThe cramped quarters also haven't changed much, but that's just part of the appeal.  As strange as it may sound, the sheer volume that moves through this place makes it possible to place your order and get a table by the time the order is ready - provided everyone cooperates and doesn't hog their table out of their place in line.  When you're done, get up and let someone else have the table, and everything keeps moving as it should.\n\nTable tops still contain business cards from around town, and there is plenty of artwork to see as well, and the atmosphere is worth coming for, but it's the food that should keep you coming back.  While the burrito is the namesake of the place, make sure you try the quesadilla too.  They are excellent.",1
2885,"I f'in love monicals.  Perhaps because I was indoctrinated into loving this pizza as a small child.  However, when I come home to visit I often find myself wanting to come here and stuff my face.  Cheese pizza, topped with their red dressing...so wrong, but oh so right.",1
2886,"I really like Halo.\nTheir staff is very helpful, knowledgable, patient.\n\nIve had quite a few piercings at this location and its always been a really pleasant experience. All of my piercings were well placed, professionally done and healed very quickly. \n\nMy only complaint is they have a terrible selection of basic jewelry. They never have my sizes in stock. Basic sizes. Their jewelry prices are way too high. I buy my jewelry somewhere else.\n\nBut I love the staff.. \n\nGo to Halo for piercings.. shop around for your jewelry.",1
2887,"I've wanted to try this place for a while. The ambiance is beautiful. It spins faster than I anticipated. If you're fearful of heights stay away.\n\nThe food was good. We started with the pear salad. It was delicious, but small. My friend and I were concerned about the sizes of the entrees but we were in for a plesant surprise. I had the scallops and my other had the short rib canilloni. Both dishes were substantial and delicious. We ended with the cobbler and fried zucchini bread. The bread was wonderful. I would go back and recommend it. FYI - don't park in the Chase garage. They don't accept their validation.",1
2888,"I am a big fan of sushi and have been to many different sushi bars in the tempe area. I was so impressed by sushi time! First big plus - an immaculately clean and rarely crowded establishment. I am always surprised that there are never many people there when I go - maybe I just go at the wrong time, or people don't know about it, because the place rocks.  You order up at the front counter, and then they bring your tray to you when the food is ready - drinks are self serve also. \nTheir sushi is really delicious and fresh! They make one of the best Las Vegas Rolls i've ever had - make sure to try it if you go. Also, every day they have 'combos' posted, where it's $10.99 for two types of rolls (the rolls in each combo are different every day) and miso soup. For the price, delicious sushi, and clean, modern atmosphere, I would definitely recommend this place!",1
2889,"I was tricked into coming here.  This place serves burgers and pretty much nothing else.  They offer a home-made vegan patty on the menu, but it turns out there are no vegan buns.  The waitress was kind enough to offer to put the patty on top of a couple pieces of lettuce, which is slightly better than what we've experience some other places.  But, if you are serious about trying to cater to us dietary weirdos, please go the extra step and save a spot in your freezer for a couple frozen vegan buns from Whole Foods.  You can them pop in the oven for 8 minutes on the rare occasion a vegan actual tries to partake of your otherwise flavorful offerings.",0
2890,"This is the second time I've hit Churchhill's and it was a disappointment. The fish was warm at best, limp with the batter separating from the fish. \n\nI've been to the UK, and this is nothing like that.\n\nThe fries were ok, coleslaw was bland, and they really did not know how to pour a Guinness pint. I would not recommend this to any serious English food fan. (And there is good food in the uk!)",0
2891,"It tries, but at the end of the day 944 magazine is basically an Old Town Scottsdale party picture rag (usually featuring the Dirty Scottsdale crowd) written at the 8th grade level.  \n\nDon't believe me?  Flip to the back and see the last 30 pages or so.  Multiply by the number of cosmetic surgery ads and bar/club ads and you've got a lofty quotient.  The party pics are usually why people check it out.  Kind of like when married men say they read Playboy for the articles.  RIIIGGHHT!!\n\nThey are starting to cover Phoenix and Tempe a bit more than in the past, but it's primarily a Scottsdale 20-something society/nightlife magazine.\n\nPlus if you want to see a magazine clown and insult its unsuspecting and not-so-bright readers, check out the Letters to the Editor.  I mean, wow.\n\nbtw, 944 is named for its old address when its offices were located on Mill Ave.",0
2892,"Tried:\n\nThe Full Montagu (10/10) - meat was super moist and veggies were very fresh. This was my favorite sandwich here.\n\nThe Original (8/10) - really good, but coulda used more horseradish. I highly recommend this if ur a meat kinda person, love philly cheesesteaks, and enjoy horseradish.\n\nTuna Melt (7/10) - this was really good, but i wish they woulda put some veggies in it.  it's literally tuna, cream sauce, cheese, and bread.  it's delicious, but i'm probably NOT gonna order it again if the Full Montagu is still around.",1
2893,"If you are into partying and insanity, this is the place for you.\n\nIf you are over 25 and want to enjoy Las Vegas, this is NOT the place for you.\n\nWe ate at several places in Cosmo so we were in here often but we just went in to eat and left.  Freaking insane!   People were falling down drunk, people were half naked (and not in a good way), and we saw arrests on several occasions.  \n\nLeave Cosmo to the teeny boppers and head over to Aria or anywhere else for that matter.",0
2894,"Everything is awesome except the food.\n\nInteresting menu, nice staff, fun concept, but aside from the beignets(which are only passable as something other than beignets) - the food is somewhere between subpar and plain ol terrible.\n\nOrdered a burrito, a quesadilla, some nacho-tots, and the beignets so felt like we tried it all.  There were 2 issues with every single thing we ordered.\n\n1) the ingredients weren't very good (Kinda like someone emptied out microwave burritos instead of making rice, meat, veggies, etc...)\n\n2) The food is poorly prepared.  The kids that work there are very nice but they put so much buffalo sauce on the quesadilla that it was inedible, and the burrito was layered like a parfait so that each bite was a single but different ingredient.\n\nMight try again some day but doubt it.",0
2895,Beer! There is not much else to say! The Beer selection here at WOB is awesome with over 50 rotating taps and 10 beer frigs shelving hundreds of bottles even some 22oz selections! WOB has domestic as well as regions all over the world with all different price points and types. When it comes to the tap they keep it seasonal and try to get limited batches that other bars may not have! I think I found my new spot for winding down after work!,1
2896,"I suppose if this is your thing... First impressions, location is quite poor. Best thing in area is Hispanic grocery and goods store across the street. Locale itself is pretty beat. Go here only if you absolutely must. Dark (at night), music is good if Chris is spinning the tunes. But the environment itself is really lackluster. The place lacks what people would consider \""""character.\"""" I have to give it a low rating overall.",0
2897,"My boyfriend and I went there for the first time because we had a groupon. I am so happy I found this place!!! We only ate sushi so I cant speak for the meals. The sushi was awesome, fresh taste, unique rolls, and huge portions! At first we thought it seemed pricey but after seeing how big the rolls were it was definitely a good deal. \nThe only reason I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5 star rating is because the service was just so so; we were one of 4 tables (at 3pm) and it just took a little longer than we would have liked to get our order taken or to get our food. \nWe will be visiting again!",1
2898,I found this place by accident its in a strip mall with AT&T and some time to wait for my phone so went over to eat lunch! I had the Chicken Teryiaki Bowl which was a very large portion and very tasty. The atmosphere is very pleasant and a little on the darker side but we enjoyed it! They have a large selection of cocktails as well.The service was very good and will go back to try the sushi next time.,1
2899,"I just had the worst experience with this cab company. I called for a cab at 11:30 am, 30 minutes prior to my desired departure time. I then waited for 30 minutes and did not receive any phone calls from any driver. So I called the company back at 11:30 am. They said the driver would be there within a few minutes and I pressed that I had a flight at 12:38 pm. I then waited for another 15 minutes and again did not hear from anyone. So I called the cab company again and they said they had a driver coming. The driver finally called me at 11:48 am and said he just got the dispatch and was heading over from the strip and would need 15-20 minutes to arrive at my destination. Not only was the driver late, but he was incredibly rude on the phone. I asked if there was anything he could do since by the time he arrived I would miss my flight and he only kept repeating: \""""Do you want me to come or not?\"""" As you can guess, I missed my flight. \n\nI would never use this cab company again.",0
2900,"A candy shop with real food, too? Yes, please! The menu is huge and there are so many things I wanted to try from sweet to savory crepes, burgers, pasta, salad and desserts for days! Set up like an upscale diner the ambiance was fun and the service was good. We started off with fried macaroni balls, they were delicious, but only came with three for the table. After much debate on my entree choice, I settled on the bleu burger which was delicious, juicy and huge. I ate every bite, and it was well worth it. For dessert we had the cookies sundae which was good, though I wish there was more ice cream and less whip cream. Overall, I would recommend this place, but be prepared for a large bill, even if you don't order alcohol.",1
2901,"Love this place! Great rooms, great bar/restaurant, access to Golds gym, free coffee in the morning, happy hour in the evening, good service and awesome location within walking distance to tons of stuff. I always stay here when I am in Phoenix.",1

2903,"A dear friend of mine turned 40 in January and her mother arranged for a get together to celebrate her birthday here. I was a little put off at the idea of a pool hall and when I looked up the location, I realized this had some other name when we were in high school and has been around for a long time. \n\nThe whole Metro Center area has changed a lot over the years. Back in the 80's it was a great place to cruise (when we weren't on Central Avenue), but I digress. I borrowed mom's car, drove from Sun City and arrived close to the start time of the get together. I have been friends with Kari since we were 15 and by coming to town for her birthday weekend, was able to see some women I hadn't seen since we finished high school(back in 1989, yeah I know....)\n\nI had very low expectations and I was glad. The place is pretty run down but super low key. Had I been there for other reasons, I would have entered into one of their nightly poker tournaments, but I was there for other reasons. There was a small group of people for this shindig-around 15 at one point but really about 10 for the long haul. No one ended up playing pool, but there were tons of tables, along with darts and some video games. They had a great jukebox and we had a blast playing all sorts of music from several different decades. They offer food (no one ordered any), a full bar and lots of specials on beer. The cocktail waitresses were very nice but that could be because I tip very well, but it was fun. \n \nThis place could use a really good cleaning as I left smelling like something stale/moldy. Not such a good thing when only in town for the weekend with limited clothing. Thank you Febreeze!",1
2904,"I was initially a bit skeptical about coming here because 1) there were bad reviews and 2)  they were doing a groupon sale.  I know my second reason may sound weird to some of you but businesses promote their business on groupon normally when they're struggling, which may be a result of poor service.\n\nSo I contacted them to ask them if their groupon deal was applicable to any day since it was a \""""now\"""" deal at the time. But the man who answered, Joe, told me that I don't need to purchase it online through groupon and that I just come in and tell him my name and look for him so that he can honor the deal regardless of whether I purchase the deal or not.\n\nSo I made my way there which is in the gas station at the intersection of Sahara and Durango. A bit far from where I live and work but most places around me were going to charge me $35-70 for the same service so I made the trip here. \n\nAs soon as I arrived, my car was immediately attended to and it took about 35-40 minutes to do which was standard and efficient to me. Really liked the service and I'm proud of taking a gamble regardless of its low Yelp ratings. Joe, whom I assume is the manager, was very courteous and professional. I definitely can't ask for more. For my reminder sticker, they listed $3 off for my next visit, which I assume is not combined with the groupon deal.\n\nOverall, very satisfied with my experience here.",1
2905,"I am a Starbucks fanatic and I visit at least one Starbucks location a day.  I know many Baristas and I also know they move from location to location quite a bit.  With all that being said, my favorite Starbucks location, today, is the Lake Mead/Buffalo location.\n\nThe staff is competent, cordial, and extremely efficient.  It is one of the busiest locations in North West Las Vegas but they are always able to get you your drink quickly.  \n\nIt is equipped with a drivethru and a rather large out door seating area.   The indoor seating is usually crouded and not the best for large groups.  There are always patrons sitting down in this location which tells you nothing but good things about the location.",1
2906,"This is a reasonably modern theater with good stadium seating, decent prices on concessions, and decent ticket prices (plus they have student tickets).  I also like their loyalty cup program (buy a four dollar cup and you get refills for a buck for the balance of the year).\n\nThere are plenty of downsides, though.  My primary complaint is that they don't do enough to keep the screening environment pleasant.  The patrons are very loud and very rude, and the theater staff just ignores it.  The last movie I saw here was full of talkers.  The guy sitting in front of me was texting and surfing the web on his Blackberry the whole time, and at one point in the middle of the movie he actually GOT ON HIS PHONE and had a conversation.  What the hell man?  Now a rude patron isn't the fault of the movie theater, but when the manager was standing ten feet away and didn't intervene, that's not right.  They should enforce their no phone policy and make the experience comfortable for the rest of us.  Also, they don't shut the door to their auditoriums, which mean light from the hall gets in and hits the screen.  Very distracting.\n\nThere are plenty of better megaplexes around here.",0
2907,"We came in from out of town and got our 5 month Jack Russell Terrior \""""weezie\"""" groomed. She was barking up a storm not being a happy camper, but I figured she needs to learn. I was told to pick her up in a couple of hours. Two hours passed and she was not ready, I was told to wait 45 more minutes. When she was ready, Weezie was very calm. The groomer said she finally got used to the groomer. I took her home and an hour later she had a seizure. I immediately called the groomer and they said that sometimes a puppy could have a seizure if it was really stressful, but to watch her and bring her in the morning if she has another. The store was closed when Weezie had her second seizure. She had them all night one every hour. In the morning I called Bansfield and told them what happened and they said to bring her right in. When I got to Petsmart there was the tech that handed me Weezie. She told me she saw that Weezie had a seizure and told her supervisor Melissa. So when I got to Bansfield, I spoke with the receptionist and she said that Melissa came and asked her if puppies could get seizures. Being a receptionist she did not get the doctor she instead told Melissa that puppies do not get seizures. This was all new information to me, no one informed me of the seizures until then. I went in and spoke to the doctor and asked what is going on, my dog was fine yesterday and today she is having a seizure every hour. I questioned the care that was given at the groomer, possibly got dropped or she could of eaten something. The doctor said no, it looked like distemper, and was beyond what they can do at Bansfield. So I was referred to another hospital which we went and they wanted to hospitalize her and try to treat her with more medication. I asked if they could give her medication so we could get home. They did. This morning we went to our vet by our home. Her respiratory had been compromised and the seizures had taken its toll on our poor Weezie and there was nothing they could do but she could go into ICU somewhere else but that would just buy a little time. The doctor said it was way too late and she would probably not survive. So we put her to sleep. She was only 5 months old.\nWord of caution. Know where your dog is when they are getting groomed, Petsmart takes them behind closed doors. I found out they have a cage where they put the dogs in to be dried. The techs do not use their judgment on warning you if something has gone wrong to your pet, as what happened in our case. Take your pet to a less of a over crowed environment. You never know, it can happen to you! I no longer have a happy little puppy named Weezie and I do blame Petsmart as part of the problem my little puppy had.",0
2908,"After just moving here from LA, I really miss the 99 Ranch back home so I was on a search for a good place.  B/c I am in Anthem right now and work in downtown, my friends recommended Asiana b/c of distance.  It was ok. Not a huge variety b/c they are good about trying to have food from a lot of dif. ethnicities including European.  That and things seem to be a bit older.  So I was a bit disappointed but hey, at least it was something.  Then a friend told me about Super L Ranch!  OMG, 10 times better!!  Still not 99 Ranch but hey, I will take this one.  Actually, they are a LOT cleaner than 99 Ranch.  I found almost all of the things I crave and miss most from home so I love this.  And the prices seem comparable.\nThey have a great meat and fish section.  Fresh fish cooked and cleaned how you want it.\nSome people commented that the staff was rude.  I never saw any of that.  The butcher was really nice and spoke English.  The cashiers were pleasant.\nThey do have a small take out place/deli where they do have the hanging chicken and ducks, cha siu (bbq pork) and even the crispy pork.  The princess chicken is like the steamed chicken I am used to.  Not exact but I'm not going to be picky.  \nThey also have a small bakery where you can get the sweets and even baos.\nI haven't tried Lee Lee's or the other grocery store that were recommended b/c of distance but will have to.",1
2909,"This place is very overrated. The hamburgers and sides are way overpriced. Sure,  the fried egg option is awesome but the burgers do not taste that great. I went to lunch here with a friend and between the two of us it was $28+ dollars. Way too much money for a fast food  hamburger stand. For that price, I could eat at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar. The service here sucks too, I was gambling around 4AM and went up to the counter. The guy cooking did not even acknowledge me.  So I just left. There are way better hamburger places than this dump!\n\nLast great hamburger stand my A$$!!!!!!!!!!! --Very disappointed",0
2910,"Awful just awful, I gave them my car Thursday night at 4, I was informed a part needed ordered they would call me when finished, I called them the following Wednesday confused on why it was taking so long, I was informed it was done Friday and he thought he called me to tell me, I will not be going back, just crap service!!",0
2911,"I had visited this location over the years however, upon visiting on a week day afternoon, I noticed that the cafe was a bit behind on their; clean up due to further noticing that a variety of their tables were not attended after customers had left. Their service was fair however they had always been \""""tip top\"""" in attending you quickly and efficiently. Their food quality remains to be outstanding as usual. The cafe may have had a short hand of personnel on the day that I had recently visited yet I believe that they have the potential in providing improved customer service for future days.",1
2912,"I went once because I live real close, and wanted mexican food. Unfortunately, I will not be going back because it was not good. I got a burrito and it was doused in oil, it was just terrible. I did not even finish it, because it was causing an upset stomach. Maybe I just chose the wrong dish, but that dish caused me to not wanna go back.",0
2913,"I like this place. When giving ratings to sushi restaurants in Madison, it's always hard to know if I should base it on a Madison scale or a national scale. In other words, if Sushi Muramoto delivered the same quality sushi in california, they'd probably only get three stars. But being that we're in the midwest, they deserve their four stars. I'd have to say that Sushi Muramoto is one of only two sushi places in town that serves decent quality fish.\n\nMy only complaints about the food are: 1. the red sauce they put on the bottom of some rolls is WAY too overwhelmingly spicy. It takes away from the taste of the roll. 2. you could tell that they used the shittier hamachi for the negihama roll compared to just the yellowtail sushi. I love love love yellowtail so I'll usually get two pieces of sushi as well as a yellowtail+scallion roll. There was a noticeable difference in the quality of fish they used for each:( Also, 3. I ordered coke and got pepsi. I know it's not THAT big of a deal but it's a big pet peeve of mine, so I thought I'd mention it anyway. Read my tagline. I hate pepsi.\n\nBut this place gets gold stars for not being overpriced. I feel like some of the more upscale sushi places can get away with charging outrageous prices for items that should be cheap (e.g. miso soup or inari). Here, I found that they don't really do that. So props to them.\n\nThe restaurant has a good vibe and a cool lounge you can hang out in while you're waiting for your table, which you'll probably have to do. I'd definitely come back.",1
2914,"This is honestly the worst office ive ever been to.they don't greet you when you walk in the door, nor do they explain anything to you in the front.\nI was scheduled for an appointment an I get there an the front office lady tells me that she realized an hour before my apointment that  I need to see a doctor before I get my cleaning but was just in the week before getting work done.they need better communication with there staff an patients.

2915,"This isn't quite Luv-It, but it will do in a pinch. :) It kind of makes me think of what it would be like if Dairy Queen and Cold Stone had a frozen custard love child...There are plenty of mix-in choices, and the frozen custard is rich and creamy.  The drive thru is very convenient, but eating it in the car before it melts can be dangerous.  I recommend taking someone along who can feed you while you drive.:)",1
2916,"So I was out in Scottsdale early on a Thursday night.. where to go? Well we just wanted to be drinking, so I looked up dive bars on Yelp (this being Old Town Scottsdale I didn't expect anything wonderful). Well I was surprised when we ended up at DJ's.\n\nThe guy at the door was half way through Braveheart, so that should tell you pretty much all you need to know about the place. There were about 4 people in the whole bar, a sad little Marlboro dispenser with a tv screen that kept playing ads with cowboys on horses - hello how sad for someone that wants a cigg at the bar! It must be torture for some people.\n  \nThey had a few HDTVs playing golf, so you could see each drop of sweat on Tiger Wood's face - literally you could! I don't really enjoy such things.\n\nWell I ordered a Cran Vodka, and it was standard fair... you know with the cranberry juice, that is unnaturally red... like Hawaiian Punch brand red. Well it was decent, not too strong but not weak I suppose. Then after having been whining earlier about how I couldn't do shots, I did one of Absolute LA. I had wanted to try it since I love Acia. But I usually hate flavored vodka, even blueberry, so it could have been awful. But it wasn't, especially since the bartender shook it in ice before hand.\n\nOverall, we got drunk and they didn't charge us an arm or a leg! A great save, thank you mobile Yelp.",0
2917,I have eaten there in the past and the food was decent. I took mu wife there this weekend and ordered grilled fish tacos. They were terrible. Really no fish. Just a very small amount of this disgusting chopped up fish stuff. Not even sure it was fish. A weird color. Basically I paid 12.95 for lettuce and cheese tacos with beans and rice. I will never go back. Not one person asked me how my food was. Probably knew the answer.,0
2918,"Not sure what the hubbub is about this place so took the fam to check it out....ummm big mistake.  Chicken is way to greasy and really wasn't that flavorful.  Give me Popeyes or KFC or heck even Bo', over it.  Sides were not to good either.\n\nif you must go for the experience of it, then shoot, go for it, but I doubt you'll go back again.",0
2919,If you're vegetarian this place is not for you.   The food sucks.  I can make better veg byrani and paneer tikka masala at home.   I gave one star for naan roti.  Least they got that correct. I would not come here again.   I was expecting good food similar to Shalimar in northern California.,0
2920,"Food is terrible! Between the pulled pork, ribs and meatloaf, all were dry, overcooked and tasteless. They all seemed to taste like they were yesterday's leftovers and left in a warming oven. I had a baked potato which was undercooked like they threw it into the microwave for a few minutes. It was crunchy like celery and tasteless. \n\nI've never been to a place that they called a BBQ restaurant and had such poor quality where the wait staff tries to recommend what to avoid. There are a lot better restaurants in Ballantyne and surrounding areas. Don't waste your money on this one.",0

2922,"My wife and two friends decided to drive from Washington, DC to Montreal (only 9 hour drive!) for a little summer vacation. We had made no real plans in Montreal except to wander the city and experience the best it had to offer.\n\nOn Day 1, we walked up Mount Royal (great view of the city) a little passed lunchtime so we were quite hungry by the time we came down from Mount Royal. Since we were near Little Lisbon, a Portugese place sounded great until we walked by this place. The little shop is very inviting with a small room off to the side with the wall open to experience the summer breeze. We changed our plans and ate here.\n\nWe all loved it! I do not usually eat \""""living food\"""" (what the heck does that even mean), but this place was amazing. My wife and friend got the pesto lasagna and loved it (it comes with the best ceasar salad you'll ever eat). I ordered the FujiYumu sandwich with a salad. The salad was so fresh and had the best dressing I've ever had. The sandwich was great too!\n\nMy other friend ordered the dessert plate and said it was \""""just fine\"""" (vegan desserts are yet to find their place in the dessert word, but the chai icecream was great!).\n\nDefinitely go here! The water is even cool (they put clorafil in it and it turns green).",1
2923,"I took my Jeep in and was told my transmission was missing a gear. They completely fixed my Jeep within three days, they took care of my bill with a rental car.

2924,"I visited this restaurant with a group of friends. As the other reviewers wrote, it is definitely kid friendly, but also easily accommodates adults looking to grab some drinks and nomz. The food is AWESOME. The menu is simple, which I like, because I don't need to spend an hour looking. Tacos or tortas. Those are your options. I had the carnitas (pork belly) and it was amazing. My partner had the fish taco (fried) and they were to die for. These aren't massive tacos, but they are reasonably priced and the presentation is quite stunning, and it comes with 4 on a wooden serving tray. The tortillas are clearly home-made and are awesome. They came with 3 types of sauces - a habanero sauce (epic), a red-tomato sauce (very mild) and a green sauce with avocado. the drinks were also amazing!!! i'm definitely coming back to this place frequently.",1
2925,"Happy Hour at Bar Louie is just great!  $5 martinis (they've got over a dozen!) $3 drafts, $4 wine and all small plates are half-price!  Plus, Happy Hour is M-F until 7:00, later than the other bars across the way!\n\nThe food is really tasty - especially the sliders!  The crabcake ones with lemon aioli are my fave.  The Zucchini Chips are really tasty too.  Oh, and the Bavarian Pretzel sticks are really good - 4 huge soft pretzel sticks with dipping sauces.  The Hot Wings are tasty, and the quesadillas are HUGE!\n\nMy girlfriends and I have only ever sat outside.  The patio has a great view - and you get to see the underside of the planes arriving at McCarran up close!  Yes, it's a tad noisy sometimes, but it's worth it for the fresh air and lovely view.\n\nHappy Hour at Bar Louie is a fantastic way to start the weekend!",1
2926,Service n decor is outstanding! Old school vibe. Great place for friends from out of town. The name throws u off?? Sounds like a biker bar. All other reviews are on point.

Should have picked up something at Earth Fare grocery (next door) and taken it home.  Really bad experience.",0

This was my first time there and certainly not the last.  The attention was incredible and so friendly.  The food was really good and very distinctively flavored.  I can tell you those chicken taquitos I had were not frozen and well priced.  Loved the ambiance inside and the plushy sofas inside, although I was sitting outside because I was with my dog.  Overall a great place, go ahead and try it.",1
2929,"I've only been to Brio for special occasions. The first was my 21st birthday, the next was the night I got engaged, and the last was for dinner after my husband and I had our civil wedding.\n\nBrio does special occasions like a buncha pros. On my birthday, they made me feel so special, with a free dessert that said \""""Happy 21st\"""" and a coupon for a free appetizer on my next visit. We didn't get engaged until after dinner, so they didn't do anything for that, lol. But it was still a really romantic date (as far as I knew at the time!) Then, for our wedding dinner, it was me and my husband and our parents, and they really went out of our way to make it a celebration. The waiter was so friendly, and we got an entire dessert sampler complimentary. My husband was wearing his dress blues since we came straight from the wedding, and the staff was thanking him for his service, which we thought was cute.\n\nBottom line, I love this restaurant. Eat here!\n\nFoods I love: the spicy shrimp and eggplant appetizer is to die for, the caesar salad isn't too anchovy-tasting, and the mushroom ravioli is my favorite dish.:)",1
2930,"First time visiting Tempe, and first time visiting WOB. After bouncing through a couple other bars on Mill Avenue, I landed at WOB. I must say, the staff and atmosphere made me feel much more comfortable than my earlier journeys that evening. I wouldn't call myself a beer enthusiast, but after our server brought us a flight of various samples, I was hooked! The atmosphere was GREAT, live music and a friendly crowd. I didn't realize the endless possibilities, and at first I was a bit overwhelmed. However, our server (who was extremely knowledgable on beer) pointed us in the right direction!  Highly recommend this place if your looking to have some fun on a night out,",1
2931,"This is a nice place for a quiet dinner or if you're hosting a big party since they have plenty of room to accommodate both with intimacy.  Although you show up for the steaks I was quite impressed with the seafood appetizers as we had the Sushi Sampler and Bacon wrapped Shrimp.  Although the appetizers were delicious they aren't bountiful, just enough to satisfy a taste of three or four bites.  While I had the glorious ribeye with a great presentation of steak sauce.  A meal here is pricey but the food is more than deserving and a great dining experience.",1
2932,"We ate here around 2am after a late night out at the clubs - while in Vegas for a business conference  - and it was outstanding.  I had the Mongolian Beef and my two colleagues had other relatively common Chinese dishes, and all were excellent.

Would definitely go again.",1
2933,"Boy oh boy! This is definitely one of the shows that should have a big poster board in bright neon and bold letters in the box office entrance that states: \n\n\""""IF YOU ARE EASILY OFFENDED, TURN AROUND AND GO WATCH A FREAKING MUSICAL!\"""" \n\nThis production is definitely one of the few shows that holds nothing back, literally. If you are a white or black, skinny or overweight, liberal or conservative, they will touch upon anything and exploit to the nth degree. It pulls no punches and instead it actually tries to delivers a knockout shot each and every time. Most people leave after the minute in the first round. Clearly stated, if you are easily offended, this is the worst show you will have ever seen... if you can handle taking a few jokes, it might still be the worst show you have ever seen. Simply put, you have to BE the worst person in the world for the 1.5 hour show to truly enjoy it. Based on the crowd reaction as well as amount of people that still flock to Absinthe, many of us are absolutely cruel people. (Har har Har) \n\n\nAll in all, for myself, I couldn't stop laughing in this show. It's just bad for all the right reasons. The Gazillionaire pretty much opens up the show with a blitzkrieg with enough ammunition to lay waste to everyone in the tent. No holds barred and you can see the audience tensing up as they have no idea what's in stored for his verbal barrage soon to come. \n\nPenny the trusty a filthy mouthed sidekick is just as crude if not more... she has her \""""monologue\"""" (if that's what you want to call it) and I can't tell you the kind of faces I've seen in the audience who were NOT laughing. About 90 percent of us were almost going to have our stomaches collapse on us but the other 10 percent were in face palm mode. Great stuff though. \n\nOh wait... Did I forget to mention it was a VARIETY SHOW? \n\nAbsinthe is built around the tasteless and profane comedy but in it's entirety is reminiscent of a 50's traveling circus act. From acrobats, trapeze,  tight rope walking, bizarro acts etc... they provide a little  bit of everything to amaze audiences in a small confined space. There is a little bit of singing and dancing but nothing to divert the act from anything less than a circus show. The performers that night were all on point. Didn't see any major mess-ups and all of them put on a great show. My favorite were the roller skaters... it was exhilarating since they were performing pretty risky maneuvers on such a small platform right in front of the audience. The Gazillionaire did a great job introducing and selling the show to the audience all the while still making us laugh. \n\n\nTo finish up this review, I really do believe this is probably the top 2-3 shows in town. As long as you have an open mind and is willingly ready to enjoy the debauchery it's just a great time. Totally would recommend it to adults and maybe some older folks. Definitely leave the kids at home.. it's 18 up but even 18 year old kids should wait on this one. I'm 24 and I've been corrupted by 'Penny's Puppets\"""" Hahahaha",0
2934,"short version: good food, great flavors, generous portions, and awful service. \n\nlong version:\nWe got 1 veggie combo + 1 fish with peppers and onions and everything was delicious. Also, despite us both having hearty appetites, it was enough to fill the both of us for 2 meals! We took home an entire large container that we ate for dinner the next day and the bill came out to less than $30 including tax + tip! Usually, we order an appetizer and 2 veggie combos at ethopian restaurants and finish everything so the portions are definitely larger than normal.\n\nOnly reason for 4 stars is the service which is pretty awful. First, they tried bringing us overpriced water bottles even though we never asked for it. Then, they started clearing our plates before we finished eating. Lastly, they didn't fill our waters and again took it away before we were done, without asking if we wanted a refill. Also, it took quite a while to get the bill despite us being the only table of customers there by the time we finished our meal.\n\nAll that said, I would definitely come for the food again...just don't expect great service and dont come if you're in a rush.",1
2935,"Absolutely one of the best date-spots in Phoenix. The menu has a little bit of everything. from light and healthy, to decadent and rich. The service is (usually) very good, and the ambiance is quiet and candle-lit. Keep in mind- if going for dinner and drinking wine and appetizing. it can get pricey.",1
2936,I had to give it the four stars because my wife loved her curry and I thoroughly enjoyed mine. I had the mango chicken curry and my wife had the pineapple chicken curry and both were well balanced in flavor. The sweetness from the fruit was perfectly offset by the spiciness and the coconut cream gave the curry a great texture. We also ordered the 'fresh rolls' aka spring rolls and they were good but nothing out of the norm. The young waiter was very polite and prompt.,1
2937,"Marquee in the Cosmopolitan will become the next big club in Vegas. From the moment I walked into the lobby to being in the night club. I was in awe.\n\nThis club is giant, you have take an elevator up to the 6th floor and up there were 3 levels to the club. The first floor you get off of is the main dance floor where the dj is. Lots of tables and a pretty big dance floor. A long bar and the nicest bathroom ever with lots of sitting room but they don't let you sit for very long. They make you leave after a while.\n\nIf you go downstairs, it's called the Boombox. A smaller dance area with another bar playing different music than the other floor. If you go up one level from the main floor, you're at the library. Definitely just a place for you to chill and rest up, again playing different music from the other floors and has its own bars and some pool tables. From that floor, there's a balcony that you can go on that is above the main dance floor and you could see everything. There's also an outside part to club by the pool? with an outdoor bar and cabana seating. We didn't stay out there very long because it was freezing but I bet it's really nice during the summer.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that there's not that many places to sit on the main floor. And when it gets crowded, the walk ways are almost impossible to go through without squeezing past one another.\n\nOther than those, I'll definitely be going back to this place when I get the chance especially to see Kaskade since he's made his home here for the next year! He'll be there once every month!",1
2938,"Sad, sad, sad! This place is no where near close to what the Hollywood location has to offer. The lines are much longer in Hollywood I have to admit, but the service and food quality has to be the worse. When we got up to the front, yes! the front of the line. The girl presume to chat with her co workers and both registers were open they just continued on chatting for a good 3 minute and sweet little me don't want to interrupt their thought process and waited on them. So i couldn't take it any longer and asked her for an OZZIE dog! What in the blue? they don't have it at this location?? okay so I got the hot dog that was closest to it. Fine, after we ordered she still stood there chatting away. OMG! why were they hired? We didn't get our food until 20 minutes later. Umm it's just hot dogs, put the dog into the bun and add the condiments. Not that hard and not too much to ask for. I will not be going to this establishment ever again. What a pity.",0

2942,"Not a very pleasant experience as I had set a very high expectations for this place. We were a party of 8, got a table and until that point everything was OK, the wait wasn't too bad. Off coarse, we get a waiter that all hyped up and was rushing us to order, I ask for some Salsa and Chips, he acted all surprised and said that he will charge me for it, OK, no problem. Then we go on and I asked for a green salsa and his reply was \""""you can have whatever you want\"""" not to mention he was going to tag me with additional $9.00 for Guacamole dip, well I asked for green Salsa not a dip.

The food comes in, I ordered the fish of the day, Scottish Salmon, good plate presentation until the plate tasted like all SALT, went on and tried to eat as we were all starving, it got to the point where I could not continue. Mentioned it to the MOD and she did a great job by addressing it. Bottom line, it wasn't a well perceived experience.",0
2943,"I went here for an early bird dinner after an afternoon of shopping, and it was just perfect.  It was before the dinner crowd, so it was nice and quiet, cool, and clean.  The booth was so comfortable, and had an amazing high back to the seat.  We received great service, and the food was amazing.\n\nMy friend and I shared the caprese, made with buffalo mozzerella, just divine, and the others had the stuffed mushrooms.  I am not a fan of mushrooms, but they had nothing but wonderful things to say.  They have a pretty great early bird special that the group took advantage of.  By the way, if you order soup, don't expect a little cup.  You get a large bowl of delicious minestrone.  After that and appetizers, it's almost impossible to complete your meal.  I had the capellini, which is great fresh and great microwaved.  The rest of the group had eggplant parmesan and spaghetti, meat lasagna and spaghetti, and this chicken and mushroom with fettucine plate.  Everyone was full and happy with their choices.\n\nI would love to return on my next trip to Vegas.",1
2944,"We spent many rainy days at the Children's Museum by the Historical Museum while I was growing up, so I was excited to take my younger brothers -- ages 10 and 14 -- to the new one. It is bright, colorful, and attention-grabbing the minute you walk in the door. We didn't make it past the first water fountain for a good 15 minutes -- turning a wheel changes the water pressure, challenging you to find the sweet spot that brings the spout of water parallel to the slide, waiting to carry the ball away. After finally tearing ourselves away, we stumbled into a sunken area with mazes of tunnels, a sensory water hut, and small pods perfect for curling up with a book. Then, we realized it was meant for ages 6 and under. Oops. \n\nMore highlights: Crazy tunnel area on the second floor. Art area (especially the decorated bottle caps that made up the walls). Screen that senses your facial expressions, creating animal noises that match what you do (yawn = deafening lion roar). Hamster/people wheel.\n\nIt also looks like they have pretty good, healthy food in the cafe, although we were full of farmer's market goodies and so didn't try anything.",1
2945,"Number 1 tip:  Come here starving - not hungry.\n\nFor those of you that have never been to a Brazilian steak house.  It is an all you can eat steak / meat place, where the servers come around with various cuts of meats on large swords.  The meats range from filet mignon wrapped in bacon to chicken and cheese and everything in between.\n \nYou must try the Brazilian cheese breads.  They are chewy and very cheesy.  They also fried plantains - which makes a good side, the sweetness will cut through the saltiness and richness of the meats.  I wish they would also serve the fried cassava / yucca - which can be found all the competitors.\n \nThey also have a full salad bar, with an abundance of meats, cheeses, pastas, and veggies.  A must for me here - the smoked salmon.\n\nPlease note that dessert is not included the meal - that's if you even have room for it.",1
2946,"My family & I have a wonderful time staying at Red Lion Inn & Suites on 08/27/13.  Check in was so fast & friendly. The Clerk was very nice & helpful. He told me I have an automatic upgrade to a full suite with kitchen. He shows me actually where my room is on the map, which is 25 steps away. I park my car right under my room. I can see my car from my room. The staff are very friendly. Breakfast in the morning is ok. The most fancy thing my niece & nephew love is the pancake. Everything else is just regular continental breakfast.\n\nThe room was very clean, beds are clean & pillows very comfortable.  The kitchen is very clean & the fridge is huge.  It is very nice to have the kitchen we went to Fry supermarket & brought corns to cook & green grapes to washed in the sink.  The pool was small & kinna dirty. The room is quiet.

2947,"This place has an identity problem. The should not pretend to be a \""""vintage\"""" clothing store because they are not. Their idea of vintage is a one year old pair of True Religion jeans.

She responded yes & pointed to a girl talking to friends at the bar....we did finally get our drinks delivered by the manager who walked past us 20 min earlier.. No napkins & NO olives in the Martini \n     The table behind was having similar service issues, until someone who is running for Judge joined them, then their service was golden~ except NO cocktail napkins either~  WTF?

Drinks were large as they should be for the price. Apps were okay. Onion soup was awesome and vegetable salad solid. But the entrees were absolutely horrible. I had the pork belly and could only get through a  bite.

I cleared my plate!!  \n\nThe dinner menu wasn't as good  IMO, but it still offered a good selection of items I would order.  I wound up getting the veggie burrito.  It was ok - there wasn't any beans in it which I was kind of surpised about.  Usually veggie burritos = black bean burritos in my experience.  My margarita wasn't the best by any means.

2958,"When I signed up for my apartment, it included a $25 Cox credit for signing up. That credit never appeared.

It ceased to be worth my effort to pursue, which was their plan all along.\n\nRecently, my Cox internet service started going out several times a day, so I called them, and they sent a tech out to investigate.

2961,I have been a regular here with my husband for a long time and it never let's me down. The only down side is the price of food.

You also can't go wrong with the roasted corn and sweet potato baked in the beautifully presented green chili. Love the beer and wine selection aswell.,1
2962,"Ok, let me start out by saying that the staff here is friendly, and if you get a decent seat, the views of the Flamingo Habitat are very nice.  However, the food at the buffet isn't good and the selection that they offer for a buffet could be a lot better (very small selection of items compared to all the other buffets I've been to in Vegas).  They don't even serve regular pancakes or french toast for Breakfast.  Waffles only.  Really??  If they offered more items I'd be willing to try it again and hopefully give it a better rating.",0
2963,"Vegas, here we come baby!  Ready to play....with our 10 & 11 year old boys!  With two kids in tow, we decided that space was a priority for our Vegas accommodations and the Palms Place delivered.  Our one bedroom, 1 1/2 bathroom suite was huge!  The living area had a pull out couch and plenty of room for a roll away bed. There was a kitchen with full size appliances.  The fireplace was a great touch. \n\nThe bedroom was big, with plenty of closets, storage space, and a big jacuzzi tub.  The only one of us who actually indulged in the tub was my 10 year old son!The platform bed was comfy with quality linen.  The bathroom was large, including a huge walk in shower with three shower heads.  The vanity area included a magnifying mirror and a small television.  It was also a luxury to have a powder room so the boys did not bother us when they needed to use the facilities early in the morning. \n\nThe hotel staff was courteous and answered requests promptly.  I really liked that the lobby of the Palms Place does not have a casino so you can walk right up to the room without any distractions (and smoke). However, if the casino is calling you, there is a second floor walkway to the Palms Hotel next door where there is the obligatory casino, buffet, as well as many other restaurants. \n\nFor us, the hotel was a good value as well. I could not say the exact price per night, as we got a package from vegas.com with airfare and rental car included.   I'm sure that for the money there might be smaller rooms that are even more luxurious.  I did find that the towels were not fluffy, the toiletries offered were nothing special, no robes were offered, and some things were just \""""off\"""" (like a lamp shade missing). Also, the hotel is not near the main action on the strip.  If we return to Vegas though with the entire family again, Palms Place will probably get a repeat visit.",1

This time however... Was gross. \n\nFirst, we got to our room and noticed a faint smell. We unpacked and as we did so, I stepped in a wet spot on the floor. I quickly put my shoes back on and decided that not even socks were OK in this room. After we opened the bathroom doors, the smell got stronger... And, then even stronger a few hours later. \n\nLater that evening. I sat on the edge of the bed, and the mattress fell through the frame. Looking around, I noticed that the furniture was pretty beat up as well. \n\nWe were only there two nights and it was on the second night that we decided to turn on the TV...

2975,"I have been ordering from Winder for over a year now.  Both my wife and I work full time and have two young daughters;  yes we pay a premium (fees, higher prices, etc.)but not having to shop for staples every week really helps us manage the household.  I could use grocery delivery from Vons or another store, but I believe I am buying really good quality food.\n\nThe produce is okay, it is hit or miss.  I can keep the fruit basket full with Gala Apples and Pears every week for the kids.  The meat is overpriced (I pay less at a butcher I go to once a month) but I really enjoy the milk and appreciate that it does not have hormones. We started with Winder specifically to prevent our daughters from drinking too much milk with hormones.  The dairy and bakery products and lunch meats are a reasonable deal and we have found the quality to be quite good.\n\nFor customer service, I found calling works the best.\n\nThe most frustrating thing is that in the year I have used Winder I believe they have changed the website a few times and actually have made it worse.  The website is too slow.  For a business that relies on the internet for customer orders, they need to invest in a consultant to fix the website and make it faster or use less graphics.  I am running a new machine and this website is one of the worst I use.",1
2976,"The food is terrible. Nachos are not difficult to make and when they are horribly made that's when you know the cooks cannot even work a microwave.

The seating in the dining area is also atrociously set and the booths are uncomfortable. I would personally recommend going anywhere else for lunch.",0
2977,"This is the best pizza spot in Phoenix, hands down. You've gotta love the Italian craftsmanship that goes into each pie. Sausage, prosciutto and salmon are the house favorites and each pie comes with a generous drizzle of olive oil. The crust is chewy and fresh outta the oven, with delicious bubbles of char. \n\nThe atmosphere is reason enough to come here. This place packs the crowds in every night for dinner in its charming turn-of-the-century downtown home. The owners are sweethearts, the wine flows consistently and it's a vibrant downtown must-do. Skip it on First Fridays, though... the crowds can get too intense.",1
2978,"Recently my husband and I were on our way to an appointment, and in need of dinner and having about an hour to kill, we decided to try Casa Reynoso since we see it every time we shop at the Fry's grocery store located in the same strip.  I was interested to see if this family-owned place had decent Mexican food.  Having been raised on New Mexico-style Mexican food, I am always on the hunt for food that tastes like Grandma's.  \n\nCasa Reynoso was just ok.  The decor is dated and slightly dingey, but I never judge a restaurant on their decor, it is the service and food that matter, so let's get to that:\n\n-The service was decent.  The waitress seemed to be in a hurry and no one was smiling.  The place wasn't very busy, but we had to wait a while to get our drinks and small little basket of chips and cup of bland, watery salsa.   \n\n-The food quality was just ok.  Nothing outstanding in my book.  I ordered the taco, enchilada, and relleno combination plate with rice and beans.  The rice and beans were probably the best thing I ate there.  The beans had great flavor and not too much salt, and the rice was cooked perfectly, also with lots of flavor.  It's difficult mess up a standard fried beef taco, and the one I had was the same as any other taco you'll get on a combination plate at any Mexican place.  The relleno was also ok, but not a lot of flavor and too much egg.  The enchilada was your regular old cheese rolled into a tortilla and smothered in cheese and enchilada sauce.  The sauce was absolutely disgusting and I ended up only eating a bite of the enchilada.  I will say that I appreciate that they didn't mask the blandness of the food by absolutely suffocating it in cheese.  The food was so mediocre that I don't even remember what my husband ordered, and he definitely didn't rave about it.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't jump to recommend this place to anyone.  The food is mediocre, the staff didn't seem to care, and honestly, we could have gone around the corner to Riva's and gotten better food at their drive-through.  \n\nOf course, I love to give second chances, and I would love to see more family-owned Mexican restaurants thrive in tempe.  A couple of other reviewers recommended the green chili and burritos.  I will have to try those next time, but I don't really have high expectations for this place and probably won't be going back any time soon.",0
2979,"I was so hungover our first morning at the MGM, I couldn't even leave the hotel even though I should have. \n\nManfriend and I decided to grab a bite at Studio Cafe after checking out the menu.\n\nThe only star goes to our waiter, Jose who was very polite and attentive.\n\nThe food is a different story. Tell me why weren't both of our  hashbrowns, which I was looking forward to the most, even lukewarm? It was COLD and tasted like cardboard. The breakfast burrito was disgusting. Took one bite and felt like throwing up. Babe's steak and eggs didn't look too appealing either. He liked the steak but everything else was a culinary disaster. From the lingerging old lady perfumes, the food and my hangover, I couldn't stand to sit there one more minute. Asked man if he didn't mind eating in the room because I was about to hurl right then and there. Grabbed Jose as quickly as we could, paid $60.00 for the worst food I've eaten in a long time. \n\nShould have Yelped it before hand but nonetheless, NEVER AGAIN.",0
2980,"Wandering through First Friday, I was craving somethin' sweet. Not having tried Sweet Republic before I was intrigued by their lil'bus. As I stood back to read the menu I was intrigued by what I saw...I [heart] bacon....sweet salted caramel....mmmmmm. \nAlways looking to try something new and always down for caramel I was torn on which one to choose...the Universe provided me with my answer as a man in front of me orders a double with a scoop of the I [heart] bacon and the caramel....[Thank You]....I decided on the same! \n\nThe bacon was a rich creamy sweet cream base with these small bits of slightly salty, slightly sugary, slightly smokey bacon morsels. Kind of reminded me of a toasted candied pecans and salted peanuts on my ice cream but BETTER. Come on people it is bacon we're talking about here!! WOW! Totally not what I expected! \n\nThe Salted caramel, was very good also but relative to what I paired it up to it was mild by comparison. Also I am kind of spoiled by the occasional treat of Hagen daz's Signature Fleur de Sel Caramel ice cream with mini chocolate caved Salted caramels.

2982,"Simple, Neopolitan-style pizza cooked to order in their brick oven. The crust is excellent, thin and soft.\n\nThey have an espresso machine, and if you like cappucino be sure to order one after you eat. It was one of the best i've ever had.",1
2983,"I had already seen the reviews and known this place would not be the same quality as the usual CPK's.  But a 7  minute wait for the Works pizza is not bad.  The other options at the airport didn't look too appetizing to me in the limited amt of time I had.  Taste was more like the usual pizzas you could get at the usual lower quality pizza chains, so I didn't feel like it was worth the money I was shelling out for this versus other fast food places.  Pizza also looked a little overcooked.  But I two stars since it didn't taste bad, wait was fast, and people at the counter were nice.",0
2984,"I have no idea what I was thinking ordering oatmeal AND splitting \""""The Kitchen Sink\"""" with Don. That was just way too much food to handle. For those of you that don't know. \""""The Kitchen Sink\"""" pretty much has everything in it. I can't even tell you what the ingredients are because the description just says. \""""For adventurers only, this one really has it all.\"""" It's also the only omelet on the menu that comes in a size large and you can't get it in any other size. \n\nMy oatmeal came out right away. It was in a regular size bowl with raisins, brown sugar, butter, and cream on the side. I mixed everything in and started chowing down. To be honest, this was the first time I've ever ordered oatmeal anywhere. I normally just eat oatmeal at home and feel like it's overpriced at restaurants, but I was craving it and it was only $2.99 (a great value for the amount you get). The texture was nice. It wasn't too thick, too watery, or too grainy, just right. I ate about half of it when the omelet came out. It was seriously huge and literally had EVERYTHING in it. It doesn't say it on the menu, but Mamie P. stated down below that it's made with SIX eggs. No wonder it's giant. I saw carrots, bell peppers, mushrooms, chili, hotdogs, cheese, bacon, ham, turkey, onions, broccoli...I'm guessing everything that's listed as ingredients for all the other omelets is in this omelet. It also come with spuds on the side and you choice of carbs, e.g. tortillas, toast, English muffin, pumpkin bread, or banana nut bread. We went with the banana nut, which was delicious and fresh. The spuds look like potato chips, but they're thicker and soft. Don is a potato freak, so he enjoyed them. The omelet was just a little too much for me, especially after eating half of my oatmeal. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty tasty with the mixture of all the meats and veggies, but I was just too full to enjoy it. If we ONLY ordered the omelet, I think I would've really liked it. Don enjoyed the amount of mushrooms it had in it and the Filipino in him really loved the hotdogs as well. I really suggest you only get \""""The Kitchen Sink\"""" if you're splitting it between at least two people and that's all you're ordering. You should also be fine with the amount of random ingredients that are in it. It's kind of like an \""""ghetto\"""" omelet in which everything is just thrown into. \n\nAll in all, I like this place. The menu is very broad, they have about 40 or so omelets, and the service is fast and friendly. I noticed there were a lot of regulars when I went, so it almost felt like having breakfast at someone's house (not in an awkward way). When we were walking out I even noticed a cookie jar that was just like the cookie jar my mom had in our kitchen when I was little (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/s4JjYgLO5dGUUV9Op4YBrw/l.jpg). It was literally the same exact one. I didn't say anything, but ten seconds later, Don said, \""""Dude, that's the same cookie jar my mom had when I was little.\"""" So we learned that we had something in common as kids. Next time, I'll stick to a smaller omelet though, or maybe stuffed French toast and definitely another piece of their banana nut bread;)",1
2985,"Just NOT my type of place. I went with a group of friends on a Saturday night around 8, and by 9 the place was packed.....With a very older crowd. At 38 I was probably in the bottom 10% of the age range, maybe 5%. Drinks were decent, but SUPER Expensive. Almost $15 for a martini. \nBy 10 the place was pounding pretty good, I have to say their sound/lighting system was pretty awesome. I just don't want to see women old enough to be my mom shaking their asses on the stage. If you're in the 40-60 range and looking for a solid place to party, and relive your 20s, THIS is probably your spot..... \nNot trying to be rude to the older crowd, I think its damn cool that you still know how to party....I just don't want to be there while you are! And a friendly heads up to the 21-39 crowd to avoid this place, unless you're looking for love from an older guy/girl.\nReally my 1st Club-Type(but not really a club) experience in Phoenix. It was a pleasant surprise that nobody was really being a drunken slob like so many club type environments in Chicagoland. I'm not sure if I can attribute that to the age group or Phoenix in general. \nEither way, not a place I'd go to again......\nTip to Management/Owner.....Having grown up in the Chicagoland Club Scene in the 90s and 00s, if you're going to have a club environment, have room for people to dance. Ditch all the tables in the 1st room in lieu of a dance floor.",0
2986,"I like the open areas outside (kind of a wrap-around patio), but other than that, there's really no point. The food is quite awful. The happy hour specials are so-so. The drinks are bleh.

So um, sit outside near the front entrance, get a beer, and enjoy the live music and Fremont St. people-watching.",0
2987,The sushi here is fine but nothing special. I placed an order for pick up. I had looked up the menu on two different websites. I ordered three roles to share with my husband and it was suppose to total $20. When I got there it was $28. When I told them that the prices online were different they just said they changed the menu recently. I asked if they had a menu I could take with me they said no. I don't think we will be back. There are better sushi places for the same price.,0
2988,"We were craving food from this place so badly the other night that I drove all the way from South Phoenix to Chandler to pick some up! The food was ready just a few minutes after I got there, and they must have packaged it *really* well (or made it super hot) because it was still hot when I got home 30 minutes later. We didn't try anything new (just the Pad Thai and duck curry, our favorites from last time), but it was just as delicious. The only change I made was ordering our curry \""""5\"""" (on the 1 to 5 spiciness scale) - it was definitely hot but not as hot as we would get in the Bay Area when we asked for spicy. Can't wait to go back again!",1
2989,The Outdoor pool is a must do for the summer if you live in Vegas.  It's great for children and even adults.  The only down side is that there is limited loungers and chairs.  If you don't get there early you'll be sitting on the ground.  Still full for all ages.,1
2990,"I was very disappointed after my first visit to the Graze and I doubt I will be back. Some friends of ours were in town from Milwaukee and we meeted them at the Graze for brunch. After being seated we noticed we had dirty water glasses and requested new ones. Our waiter appeared as though he had just rolled out of bed and seemed like he was high or something...so the service we received was not good and his unprofessional appearance was not very appetizing. We then proceeded to wait almost an hour and a half to receive our food. Some of the tables surrounding us received some beignets on the house to apologize for the long wait, however, we were not one of them. Instead our waiter offered few apologies and kept bringing us more coffee in more dirty cups. We ordered the cheese platter to share amongst the four of us and our waiter never brought us plates so we akwardly tried to eat it right off of the platter. Not to mention the portion was minute. I got the lox on a bagel and it was downright disappointing. The bagel was neither toasted nor fresh, it was stale. And the amount of lax wasn't even enough to cover one half of the bagel. Again for the price you pay at the Graze so not worth it. It is a shame because this place has a great location and appears to be a nice restaurant, however, dirty dishes, minute portions, the long wait and unprofessional waiters do not make me want to go back or recommend this place to others.",0
2991,Change is not good!  The special 777 changed for the worse. No more salad included. They now give you Broccoli instead of a dinner salad.  What the hell?   Why change an old school staple?  Every restaurant in the hotel is constantly changing and it's not for the better!,0
2992,"I hate having to do this, but:\n\nOne entree.\nThree completely different hairs.\nGag.\n\nMy husband stopped in and ordered to-go on Saturday night at 10:00.  Came home.  We were missing egg drop soup.  The cream cheese won-tons (crab rangoon) were good.\n\nI opened the lid on my lemon chicken and noticed a thick dark hair.  It ended up being very long and had been cooked in the batter that was on the chicken. \n\nI was very hungry and picked out the affected chicken and proceeded to eat some of the meal.  After munching on the broccoli that was under the chicken, I picked up a piece and discovered a curly white hair on it--it might have been a clothing fiber or a pet hair, not really sure, but I was SO DONE at this point.\n\nThen I glanced over at the cup of lemon sauce stuff I had been given and noticed an eyebrow hair stuck to the inside of the cup halfway down where it wasn't noticeable until some of the sauce had been used.\n\nMy husband had orange chicken and said that it was really tough and didn't taste good.\n\nHe ate one more cream cheese won-ton after they had cooled and said it didn't taste so good anymore and just tasted full of grease.  \n\nWe're both just sort of grossed out by this whole meal. :(",0

Especially since the contractor who is working at my neighbor's house was on our roofs taking photos yesterday.  We have no idea why. Unnerving.,0
2995,"Yum, this is my favorite breakfast place on the Strip. While the prices are high, the food is worthy of the price and leaves me longing for more. I love the red, black, and white modern decor, which fits nicely with the general decor of the casino. \n\nI had some type of a hollandaise breakfast sandwich. I don't even like hollandaise but loved this! It was sumptuous, filling, and the perfect morning-after meal. Coffee and water are plentiful and there's was plenty of great people-watching. The cafe looks out onto the casino and is one of the easier places to get into. \n\nAlcoholic morning beverages are plentiful with an drink cart that circulates.",1
2996,"I have been in search of 3 things in this town. \n\n1. Good Service \n2. Better tasting food then my friends or I can cook at home. \n3. And a final bill that is in line with the entire experience.\n\nThe Service\nWe decided to eat at the busiest time in the evening so much of the issues with the service were understandable. In fact we were there right after a large convention let out on Tuesday. The hostess was very nice and was able to seat us at the bar which ended up saving us from a long wait. Once at the bar we received our water and menus. Later the bread and oil made its way to the table/bar. Our waiter was as attentive as he could be seeing that the place was crazy busy. \n\nThe Food\nWe had a salad, rice balls, and the pork raviolis, and of course bread and oil. The salad was so simple it didn't inspire me to want to finish it. The rice balls were just tasteless. And the raviolis had a processed taste to them which wasn't too bad but I could definitely make better ones at home. Bottom line...if you have to eat here just get the bread and oil with a nice over priced glass of wine.\n\nThe Experience\nUnfortunately poor Otto's gets a one star because the food just didn't pass the \""""Can I make this better at home test\"""" plus the price was not in line with the taste. The portions were all out of line with what a normal human consumes at dinner which made us search for a hefty desert after we left. Thank god the Venetian has tons of places to get a tasty desert. I mean it's amazing what a tasty treat can do to make you forget about an tastless dinner. \n\nHere is a tip for the management!\nThe view of all the goings on in the court yard at the Venetian is priceless. And the fact that the huge Sands convention center brings in countless hungry visitors in the evening who will eventually fly back to their home towns, makes your place unique. In other words you have a captive audience. So you really don't have to change a thing. Many of your customers are expensing  their meals and could careless what the food taste like. Perhaps it would be a wise idea to raise your prices and ship in food from Fazolis. The food would taste better for sure and the profits would sky rocket.",0
2997,"After experiencing fish & chips here for the first time, my resolve was just get through the meal and never try it again. For me it was just horrible. The fish batter as just too much and the fish tasted as if it was not washed with lime or vinegar before being cooked, so I could hard keep it down. \n\nI don't know others seem to like it...

Checking in at 2:30a wasn't a problem and neither was getting a late checkout.  I didn't get to check out many of the restaurants or food there however there is a lot to choose from.

Every bit a mom n' pop spot and the sort of place that looks as though it has \""""been there fooorrrrrever\"""" to feed little Badgers and alumni alike it was first with a startle and then a smile that my server eventually came around the corner and much to my delight it was almost as if he was baring gifts, a full tray of Frisbee-sized fritters glistening beneath wet glaze and still hot to the touch.

3006,"Was actually somewhat disappointed with our experience here.  My daughter and I booked spa treatments to celebrate her recent college graduation and the imminent start of her first job, and showed up a bit  early so we could have lunch and enjoy the facilities.   The setting is absolutely beautiful - Camelback Mountain is RIGHT THERE - but I thought the resort itself was a bit underwhelming... particularly the pool and spa area.    We ended up having lunch at the restaurant Elements.  Great table with a wonderful view, attentive service, but the food was a complete disappointment.  We started with charred edamame - something we usually love, but it had the most unpleasant-tasting marinade/sauce over it.  Not sure if it was vinegar- or citrus-based, but it did not taste good.  I also ordered the lobster bisque and, although it had a seafood taste to it, I couldn't find a single piece of lobster in it.   They make a presentation of delivering the bowl with an assortment of minced items in it, to which they then ladle the cream over.   Perhaps it was just because it was minced so small, but I couldn't find a single piece that had the texture and taste of lobster.  Given we were there for a special occasion and wanted to keep the mood happy and upbeat, we didn't voice our complaints to the waitress, although I was somewhat surprised she didn't notice/ask why we only ate a few of the edamame.    For our main course we had the grilled cheese sandwich and the omelet - both were just okay, nothing I would go back for or order again.   Same could be said of our spa experience.... okay, but nothing special.  Given the number of top-notch resorts/spas in the area, there was nothing about our experience here that would inspire us to come back.    Disappointing, because although it was our first visit here, we had the impression the resort was one of the premier ones in the valley.    Our experience didn't bear that out.",0

3008,"Panera Bread, although a tad overpriced in my opinion, is a decent place to a grab a quick bite to eat. I am not going to say they are a healthy option compared to other \""""fast\"""" type eateries because I don't think everything on their menu is really promoting great health. However, it is a step up from a burger and fries combo at McDonald's. \n\nThis Panera is a staple of The District, sits directly facing the parking lot and is conveniently located. The establishment is large and spacious, which is good, because anytime I have been here the place has been steady with patrons. Customer service is good, although I always get hit up to get their card, which I decline, because I don't go to Panera enough to warrant getting the card. Plus, all in all I am kind of fed up with this every freakin' place I go wants to give me some card deal. Hrumph. Anyway.\n\nFood - I ordered the Chipotle Panini and my husband ordered the Smokehouse Trukey Panini. Both came out deliciously melty and warm, pressed perfectly. I received mine with chips, my husband got a cut up apple, so we shared. Overall loved the paninis. We also ordered a yummy blueberry muffin which was dense and flavorful. \n\nQuality vs. price - Again, as stated above I feel Panera to be overpriced. I got two combo paninis (which do not come with a drink), one small drink, and a muffin, my total came to almost 20 bucks. The paninis are on the smaller side, so the price value does not exactly match the quality and quantity of what you are receiving.

After waiting everything was cold except the grits. I had to wait for a complete do over. When I finally  received  my order the portions were smaller than the orginal order, but everything was hot.  I would only recommended this resturant if you aren't to hungry and have plenty of time to kill. Prices I were too high for the portions they serve.

3020,"I am so incredibly disappointed in the assistance I have received from Phoenix College. I am a first-time college student who also works full time. I enrolled in 3 classes to start easily. I have had an issue with one of my online classes for a MONTH now. Advisors have been unhelpful to say the least. They do nothing but tell me to contact the instructor, which I have tried to do several times to no avail. So I ask and advisor again, and they tell me to contact the instructor's department head. \n\nSure, that would be great, except the class begun YESTERDAY and I STILL have no gotten any answers or help regarding the issue. \n\nI would not recommend this college based on the experience I've had.

3021,"My husband ( fiance at the time) were at the la county fair and were approached to pay $200 and we could get 3 nights and 2 show tickets. We didnt have anything planned for a honeymoon so we thought sure why not. \nWe ended up using our stay for frozen fury which is held at the mgm. The resort is about 1 mile from there off the strip on the same street (tropicana)\n\nThe resort: Is nice and clean for the most part. It is located right across from the airport runway and it often sounds like a plane is going to land on you. It was awesome to have a kitchen area and a little living area. You can smell the indoor pool through out the place. The walls are pretty thin, and we could hear the kids next door every morning. we did not need to set an alarm that's for sure. The water pressure for the shower was horrible, we ended up just showering at my brothers hotel at the mgm, when we were over there. The sink did not drain welll and the towel hanger was broken. The staff that works in the front was very friendly. The offer a shuttle: its worthless, they dont pick up and drop off in the same spots so you dont know where they will be and there is actually not guarantee of pick up. 2 days we got messages on our hotel phone saying that there would not be a shuttle that day or for the rest of the day. We were not at the hotel so we would have been waiting for a long time for the shuttle if we decided to use it. \n\nThe time-share presentation: Oh boy were do i start. 1st off the 90 minute presentation we were told we had to attend, which is fine was actually 3 hours and 20ish minutes. This is just a ridiculous amount of time to spend with someone on this, maybe thats why people sign up just to get them to stop. \nThey take everyone at your time slot and put you in a room with a presenter, our presenter was pretty annoying, she thought she was funnier than she was and would call you out that youve talked about not signing up. Sorry but that isnt going to get me to sign up.....After that we went to our one on one and the guy who we were with was really nice, but we could tell he was not happy we didnt sign up. Once we turned him down they brought in a manager who changed the price and everything.  We still said no and they wouldnt allow it. We went from a 32,000 to 18,000 to 12,000 to 1,200 to 800 to a trial of 700. \n\nI wont be staying here again and i dont recommended to be honest.\n\n\nAlso a side note, there is a lot of empty lots by them which they say they own, if they owned it why wouldnt they build closer to the strip. On one of our walks back from the strip, we saw that the lot isnt owner and it is for sale.....interesting.",0
3022,"No complaints about the beef jerky and other products but their customer service needs a major rehaul.  We usually spend $200-300 when we come to Vegas, but no longer after our nightmare experience with our recent online order.  We were sent the wrong box and asked to send the box back.  Concern #1 - A customer should NOT have to pay for return postage out of their own pocket for a business' mistake even if they did offer to reimburse for postage.  Eventually we were sent a prepaid label to mail back this box.  \n\nThe 3 times I spoke to someone over the course of a week MY order was never mentioned except to say that it went to someone else.  It was not even shipped out after their error was discovered. Concern #2 - My business was NOT appreciated.

3024,"It saddens me that I have to write this review because I had such high hopes for Always Unleashed. Their method for allowing the dogs to interact with each other and their pre-screening process for evaluating new dogs led me to believe that they truly cared about the quality of the stay that dogs had there; unfortunately I have found that is not the case. They do not dedicate the necessary staffing resources or have the proper controls in place in ensure that dogs have a healthy and happy stay at their establishment. Obvious signs of sickness go overlooked without apology and their is a seeming disregard for the trust that owners place with them to keep their dogs healthy. When I picked my dog up from Always Unleashed after a weekend stay I was immediately shocked at how malnourished he appeared and how lethargic he was acting, they simply stated that dogs play hard when they are there and that his behaviour was normal. When we got home it became even more obvious that my dog was very sick and probably had been for the duration of his stay there. He was vomiting and had horrible diarrhea, he wouldn't drink any water and when I weighed him I was shocked for find that in a matter of 3 days he had lost 10 pounds. Immediately (after measuring his weight loss), I took my dog to the veterinarian, on the way I called to ask if they had noticed anything out of the ordinary with his behaviour - I was told that he was very active the entire time, that he has eaten all of his meals, and that he didn't have any vomiting or diarrhea. When I pressed to find out specifics about his meals (which I was suspicious of because nearly half of the food that I sent with him was returned to me) I was again told that he had eaten his meals, when I explained that was impossible because he still had almost half of his food leftover and it was measured out exactly I was given excuses like \""""sometimes it is hard to watch all of the dogs\"""" and \""""sometimes we miss lunches because we are only used to feeding twice a day\"""" even though previously I had been assured that he had eaten every meal completely and that it had been specifically documented as such. When I asked again to have the owner check specifically with people that had interacted with Biscuit if he had signs of sickness like diarrhea and vomitting and when that may have begun I was told \""""well, it is really hard to tell because sometimes a dog may vomit and another dog will just eat it, so we won't notice\"""" and that there are too many dogs to be observant of each dogs bowel movements, and \""""I told them to watch for that type of thing, but it was about six months ago so I don't know if they are still implementing it\"""". At every question that I posed the owner was defensive without taking any responsibility, always looking for some way to demonstrate that it was not her or her establishments fault, I was never offered so much as an insincere apology. After tests the vet informed me that my dog was severely dehydrated, and that he had a foreign body in his intestinal tract, after confirming with an ultrasound that he had a bowel obstruction they took him to surgery to remove it. I am grateful to say that he is home with us now recovering. I do not blame Always Unleashed for whatever it was that my dog ate to obstruct his bowel (even though with appropriate supervision that could have been potentially avoided as well), but I do believe that my dogs symptoms should have been noticed much earlier so that he could have been treated sooner and gone through much less suffering. Also, I was blatantly lied to with regards to him getting the food we prescribed, and the story regarding his behaviour there changed from entirely positive that he was healthy the whole time to unsure at all of how he acted or even ate. If you are lucky enough that your dog doesn't run into any trouble while you are gone, then he probably would have a great time at always unleashed, but if you are unfortunate enough that your dog needs some extra help or care, they do not have the resources, know-how, or respect for the love of your dog, to take the necessary steps to take care of him properly. Any dog owner concerned with the health of their dog while they are away, should avoid this place at all costs.",0
3025,"I'm not actually a fan of Lollicup as a company, but this one is better than the ones in southern California. There was a huge variety of drink options not available in California. I tried the Strawberry Kiss - strawberry peach tea with strawberry and peach bits. It was pretty good. I could taste the tea flavor, and there were lots of fruit chunks. It's a little on the expensive side, but what do you expect if you're paying for a drink. This Lollicup is more on par with the likes of Cha for Tea. Very surprising, considering it's literally a little shack. Well done Town Square.",1
3026,"As soon as I walked into Arrivederci in Scottsdale, I felt welcomed.\n\nThe cute, bustling Italian restaurant was cozy but elegant, with lots of chatter and linen-covered tables, and the staff at the door and servers were super-friendly. The spot is locally owned, with a second location in Ahwatukee, and my pal and I got a nice table in the corner of the restaurant to enjoy the homemade Italian food at.\n\nWe both liked how there were wine racks dividing the main dining area from the bar area, and there were pretty paintings covering the walls, while the restaurant glowed in a soft yellow light. Our server was excellent and professional, and I'd say it's a great date place if you're in the area.\n\nWe started with the Portobello Reganato con Fontina ($8.95), a mushroom topped with cheese. Our server said it was one of their most popular appetizers, and I can see why: it was plenty of food for two people to split and had a ton of cheese. The mushroom was really juicy and brought a healthier aspect to the dish, and I really enjoyed it.\n\nOur meals came with freshly baked bread, and I ordered Ravioli Caprese Gratinati ($14.95). It was a pretty traditional cheese ravioli, and nothing really stood out to me about the dish, though my companion really liked the fresh tomato sauce it was smothered in. The pasta was thick but a great consistency-there wasn't anything wrong with it, but I've just had more memorable meals.\n\nMy guest got the Vitello Madeira con Porcini ($18.95), which was veal covered in a mushroom wine sauce and served with pasta. He said he would have preferred a cream sauce instead, which is totally available to you, but he really liked the veal.\n\nFor dessert, we had the epic chocolate tiramisu the spot offered. It was a giant slab of my favorite dessert, and it tasted pretty heavenly. Definitely get it if you go here-I could have eaten the whole thing myself!\n\nMy favorite part about dining at Arrivederci was definitely the atmosphere and the service. I love places that make you feel at home, and Arrivederci certainly does that with zero pretentiousness from the staff, and I also appreciated the casual elegance vibe the place had. Not to mention, I'm still dreaming of that dessert.",1

They have awesome wings too.  Plus, everyone that works there is so nice... the type of neighborhood place you always want to order from.",1
3030,"What a pathetic excuse for Italian food. In fact, what a terrible excuse for food in general. I ordered the \""""Parmesan Crusted Tilapia\"""", which included mushy and obviously frozen fish and a bed of watery and bland spinach (3 leaves total) and orzo pasta. All off this was doused in an excess of capers and way too finely chopped cheap tomatoes. \n\nHowever, taste and presentation aside, and once all scraped off, the fish had a terribly sour after taste. Upon bringing it up to the waiter, it was blamed on the capers (great endorsement of the kitchen & recipes). However after I left, my stomach was ill the entire night and into the next day. Sparing the intimate detail of my night spent with the toilet, the summary of this meal is that the fish was frozen and once defrosted it was obviously left out beyond expiration, and then cooked and presented with the effort of a 1st grader. \n\nAt this point I'd rather go vomit again than ever visit this establishment again. As an Italian and really as a human who eats food, I'm insulted at what this place is dishing out. \n\nSpend an extra $5 a dish and go to D.O.C.G. in The Cosmopolitan instead for real Italian food.",0
3031,"Probably the best meal we had in Vegas over Thanksgiving weekend. If the weather permits, sit out on the patio and go for dinner! You have a spectacular view of the dancing waters at the Bellagio - great ambiance and fun! We started with the Baked Cheese and Tomato appetizer that was amazingly good! The bread that they serve throughout dinner is also really yummy! The boys also had the escargot that they enjoyed. For dinner I had the Butter Lettuce Salad that was fresh with a great dressing. I also had the yukon gold potato soup with brie which was delicious and very filling. My boyfriend had the Beef Wellington which he liked and my parents had the Steak Roquefort that they absolutely loved. Very tender and well prepared. And the frites that were served with it were yummy, also. Our best bang for our buck on our trip!",1
3032,"The charm of an old diner  -  something you don't get much of here las vegas with most of our restaurants consisting of multi-million dollar celebrity chef build outs or some corporate conglomerate.  So an independent is great to have.  Service is always friendly and your coffee never runs empty.  They also figured out the simplistic nature of food and beverage - cold food served on cold plates, hot food on hot plates and its all served with a smile.  Most restaurants can't figure that basic part out...\n\nSo on with the food - OH is the best independent free standing breakfast in the valley.  If you want a more refined breakfast, spend a bunch of time parking, walking through a casino, spending 5 times more, and dealing with a las vegas strip-union-pompous attitude server - read my other reviews.  But OH breakfast is very good - from there fresh breads, to their omelets, pancakes and my newest favorite - Lobster Benedict.  This Benedict comes with a good 4-5 ounces of lobster and its under $10!  Absolutely delicious and I'm not sure if I will ever order anything else on their menu.

We first waited at the front door for a minute while they were talking in the backroom. I even said/yelled a hello nd I had to finally go to the bar area and then when this asain waitress saw me she came out. After being seated we got some menus, nd as it was my second time giving this place a chance AGAIN they did not have half the menu. the drinkS ( plural )  nope. Asked for less ice and the reply was you will get it in a smaller glass then, the burger i wanted nope, oh even the chips and salsa that are suppose to come with the food they didnt have. Apparently they were serving fruit with a BURGER today. Hmmm one strawberry nd pickle literally half the size of my pinky. Nice excuse of being out of that also, not substituted with fries which is an extra cost with the burger but one strawberry, are you not suppose to put the customer first. Then my sisters food came with a hair in it nd we told our server nd of course the server compares the hair size to my sisters. Are u kidding me. After the food we presented the groupon to the asain waitress who looks at my sister like we stole the phone nd asks for id. I would give it no stars if I had an option. That lady is straight out rude, i think she owned the place because she was on her phone and laptop the whole time  in a corner, no service what so ever. NEVER AGAIN WILL I COME TO THIS PLACE. I WOULD RECOMMEND AGAINST IT IN EVERY WAY. The food ( Cajun Burger ) had no flavor to it at all. There was bland meat and one portion somewhat in the middle that tasted somewhat cajun but thats it...",0

3039,"Mandalay Bay has its major ups and its major downs...\n\nLet's start with the ups. \n\n-The restaurant choices are excellent. You can go hear great music at House of Blues or enjoy their Gospel Brunch on Sundays. Fleur and Aureole are spectacular and you have to check out the contraption that delivers the bottles of wine to you. I can't describe it, you just have to see it for your self.\n-Nice size rooms with large bathrooms. The shower is separate from the deep whirlpool bathtub and I always enjoy double sinks when traveling with my husband.\nDual closets is a plus-plenty of room to hang your nightlife attire with lots of available hangers.\n-the Bath House Spa at THEHotel (connected to Mandalay Bay) was AWESOME!! I could have stayed in there all day. I have been to several spas in my life and I would say this was one of the most unique spas to visit. If you go, you need to pay a visit to the Bath House spa.\n-Majority of the staff were pleasant to deal with (even when they were messing up, they remained smiling and would apologize numerous times about the inconvenience)\n\nNow the downs and believe me, there are some major downs..\n\n-room was dirty when we arrived. There were stains on the sheets and comforter and pistachio nut shells on the floor. eewww!\n-elevators are slow so don't wait until last minute to go anywhere\n-agree with other Yelpers that the casino area could use some updating\n-Now I talked about how much I loved the spa but be sure to note that it is expensive. I got a basic 45 minute pedicure there and it cost $80 plus tip and that was the cheapest pedicure possible. All the other ones with coconut cream, deluxe, etc were over $100. CRAZY!! If my lil piggies weren't in such dire need of new polish, I would have said Thanks, but No Thanks!!\n-Concierge staff are super nice but when I booked my tickets over the phone before coming to Vegas, the lady booked half of the tickets on the wrong date even though the itinerary they sent me had all the tickets confirmed for the correct date. Instead of giving me a $500 credit back on to my credit card, they said they could only apply a credit to my hotel bill. I wasn't thrilled with the idea but I figured that I would probably spend about that much on my room, other shows, food, spa etc so I didn't complain too much after they said twice it wasn't possible to credit my Visa back. Well.....when it was time to check out, they had only applied the credit to food and beverage at the hotel and therefore I still had almost $300 left on there. I told the lady checking me out that this was incorrect and that concierge said it could be applied to anything in the hotel (shopping, shows, the spa, etc). I stood at the Check out desk for almost an hour while that lady and her manager were trying to work it out. Their excuse was that Concierge was a different department and they didn't share the same account, yada yada yada. I told them that I was about to miss my flight now that I have been messing with this for so long. Told them to please just email me the receipt once it has been worked out so that I could leave for the airport. \n\nAnd of course, I get the receipt and view my credit card bill and GUESS WHAT..wait for it..wait for it... it is STILL incorrect... I am sure that it is going to require at least another hour long phone call to straighten it all out...",1
3040,"Terrible service. My husband and I came here about a month ago before seeing a show (we are locals). We had no consistent waiter/waitress. It was obviously shift change and no one could figure out who was waiting on our table. The apps took forever and we saw half of the order sitting under the heat lamps for ten minutes before it got brought to us. Just a bad experience over all. This past Saturday night we decided to give it another try. We thought we'd sit at the bar this time because we should definitely get better service there. Unfortunately, we picked the wrong side of the bar. The bartender completely ignored us for a good five minutes (no eye contact or anything) and one of the other bartenders from the other side asked if we had been helped yet and ended up getting us our beers. Then we were stuck with our guy again who took forever to take our order and was just non attentive. He was pretty enthralled in a conversation with a couple from Australia. I think he was crushing on the woman because she really tied up all of his attention while they were there. It's too bad because we will not be going back there ever again because of the lack of service that we received on both occasions.",0

3044,"I'll agree with Gabriel, except that I didn't manage to visit the UPS Customer Center. Yes, I did go there today, a Saturday. They're closed. Seriously, what the heck is that about? Isn't this a big city? Isn't this a major delivery center for them? I guess not.\n\nThe problem started when the shipping address on my package was off my one digit, but UPS didn't call me or email me to correct it. Instead, I happened to notice on the tracking page this morning that there was a problem. So I called (the first time) and the agent said that there was nothing I could do - I would have to wait until Monday to call, fix the address then, and they would try to deliver on Tuesday. I actually believed that for about a half hour. And then I thought... doesn't UPS take pride in being a logistics company? Can't a package be rerouted in transit? So I called and this time, the agent said that she would send a message to the local warehouse and they would call me in an hour.\n\nThree hours went by. So I figured I would go to the dang warehouse and wait for the driver to return so that I could get my package. They're closed. So I called a third time, and this agent apologized for the previous agent's error that someone would call me. And no, they won't try and redeliver a package once it's been attempted that day. And no, they can't try and fix it until Monday which means that the earliest I could get my package is Tuesday.\n\nI'm very disappointed. I will be choosing FedEx or the US Postal Service next time.

Kevin ordered one of the sandwiches which had egg, ham, and American cheese.  My bagel had zero, I mean ZERO, flavor.  Wait, I take that back, it tasted like flour!!!  I would expect for this to be a sweet bagel with hints of chocolate cookie, but they were not there.  Kevin's bagel had very little flavor as well, but what to you expect with microwaved ingredients and American cheese as the choice of cheese? \n\nThe girls behind the counter were patient, nice, and helpful, but that does not get a business anywhere when the food is just plain out awful.\n\nI will never return and you should save your money to go somewhere else.

3046,Poor prices to purchase your items.  I understand it's a business and they have to make a profit but I would go here as a last resort. I just started selling my clothes and they give the lowest price compared to other places. I wouldn't sell anything designer here.  They're looking for cheap but trend forward items that target a youthful forever 21 age group. \n\nIt is organized but the set up is strange. You leave your items and they tell you what time it will be done.  When you return they tell you the total price and which items they plan to purchase.  \n\nThey seems to give about $1-2 dollars for tops and $4-6 for jeans. They are also very picky about what they want.\n\nI was not offended by what they decided to buy or not to buy. Nor did the price bother me bc I planned to donate everything regardless but I did notice that I made more at other places.

We can be pretty picky with Italian food considering we are Italian, and the fact that we come from where Italian food is actually good (NY,Philly,NJ).

Would have been cooler without a sign that said credit cards were currently not accepted, cash only.  But still pretty cool.\nInside, the very dark environment with mafia decor and old Italian Resaurante style kept me looking around.  And an the old Vegas style lounge singer was belting out the Sinatra hits in a voice slightly better than my own (this is not a compliment to my voice).\n\nFrom here it just goes down hill.\n\nThere was a half hour wait even though an entire room of tables was wide open, not being used.  I didn't realize we'd need a reso being it was a Tues night during the off-season and the place being in a hole in the wall off the beaten path.  Perhaps this was still my fault.\n\nThe service was bad.  Friendly enough, sure.  But we didn't get the water we asked for, and even after ordering we never got a basket of bread until such a long time went by that we waved down the waitress and begged for bread and water.  Then the bread came, and had I not been starving, I would have tossed it in the garbage.  This was possibly the worst bread I have ever tasted.  Is it possible for bread to be that bad?  Apparently it is.  Not just bad, but terribly stale.  I gobbled up the chewy, stale loaf anyway because I was so hungry from waiting, nearly ripping out teeth in the process.\n\nThe main course eventually came and it was all sub-par.  Edible, yes.  In an Olive Garden quality kind of way, maybe a bit worse.  The fettuccine alfredo seemed like it was straight outta the TV dinner box.  The added shrimp were a nice size.\n\nMy Dad got ravioli's in a red sauce with meatballs.  Again, just edible.  Especially since we were starving.  But a very generic taste all around.  I honestly felt embarrassed that I brought my Pop to eat this.\n\nThis is not a true Italian place.  It is a gimmicky eatery that makes it on its speakeasy theme atmosphere.  If you have ever had real Italian food, the taste of this food will be a total let down.",0

3050,"HORRIBLE SERVICE.  We honestly had to walk out on our order because the kitchen time was 35 minutes and up once you placed your food order.  It took our server 15 minutes to even approach us for drinks upon arrival.  She never checked back for refills while we tried to wait for our food.  None of the other customers in the restaurant were pleased with the service.  Many people including us requested to speak to a manager.  Upon speaking to him he simply apologized and made an excuse for the kitchen being backed up.  The manager did not assist the servers nor did he seem to know how to handle managing a restaurant.  The wait staff seemed very frazzled and overwhelmed for such a small restaurant.  Essentially the staff seemed untrained and unable to handle their small section of tables.  We told them we would like to cancel our order and left to go to another breakfast restaurant.  We never had a chance to try the food so I cannot comment on the quality.  However, the menu was very limited if you do not like waffles.  It also was over priced with most breakfast entrees costing $9-$11 and not having large portions from what we could observe from the few tables who were fortunate enough to have received their food after the very long wait.  Overall, we will never go back to this establishment and we would not recommend it to any friends or family in the future.",0

Some exceptional items are:\n\n- Truffles Fries: \""""...tossed with white truffle oil, Parmesan cheese & fresh parsley.\"""" Contains no truffle, though still quite good.

Cooked to your temp & generally great beefy flavor with just enough bite that you don't eat the entire beef slice in your first bite. \n\nI typically go late on weekends which can be quite busy, so service does degrade a bit.  Lunch service has been good so far. \n\nGo for 2 Timin' Tuesdays for 2for1 burgers.

Compared to known prime rib names the cost and size of food is amazing. We ordered: \n\nWine: Ballard Cabernet ( wine of the month special ) and it complemented the beef well\n\nAppetizers: Me-mushroom Parmesan dip (great flavor, good consistency, could eat it on anything). Hubby- shrimp cocktail (overpriced for what it is but good).\n\nEntrees: Country cut as end cuts (20-22 oz for only $28 each). Came with choice of salad (ordered spinach salad - good amount of balsamic and strawberries and red onions went well in salad), choice of potato (ordered mashed potatoes - creamy and good butter flavor) and a side (me - creamed corn and hubby - creamed spinach). Both sides were missing something but a dash of salt and pepper helped.\n\nDesserts: Me-peach bread pudding (warm bread and a good custard. The Peaches seemed canned).

3060,"Cobbled stones and heels were never very good friends in Edinburgh. Inevitably they will argue, squabble and someone will have to give in- usually the heel in my experience. You would think that shoe shops in the City would have picked up on this profitable business. True, heels today are not a huge investment (a mere tenner in many shops) but some of us have found that one pair of shoes that fits like a glove and are comfortable to trot around in - and were not a mere tenner.\n\nAfter a fateful snap I took one of these shoes to this Timpsons thinking it can't be that hard to get fixed. The damage was 15 pounds for one shoe (back home two shoes done professionally would be 3 euros) but as I said I love these shoes. \n\nWhat I got back after two days however was something I could have done better. The glue was all over the back heel of the shoe done extremely sloppily. The heel now wiggles a bit and there is a gap between heel and shoe. I tried getting the heel off and get them done somewhere else (probably to Greece when I next get back) but as the glue is super strong and all over the suede shoe itself they now look bad. \n\nI will not be returning to this place with any shoes I treasure and I would suggest caution to anyone with a similar problem. \n\nAnyone got a good shoemaker in mind for future reference?",0

I cannot say the same for this particualar location however. I have been there a few times for breakfast, and while the food never dissapoints, the service does. It is unlikely I would never serve a server, but this was the first place a few months ago the made me do exactly that. Not indifferent servce, downright rude service. Went there on Saturday (4th) for breakfast with my wife. As we walked in, we were instantly greetes with a dour faced blonde who blurted out,,,2? Nice. Would it be too much to say welcome, or smile, or good morning, or anything, besides 2? As we sat close to the door, I watched virtually the same 'greeting' for everyone that walked in.

Once at the pass, you'll need to free-climb the rest of the way.\nYour reward?\nA 360 view of the valley, spanning from Mesa all the way to the Bradshaw and Mazatzal mountain ranges. Simply spectacular.\nI recommend starting pre-dawn, especially with the hot weather approaching.\n\nIf you do attempt this hike, wear good boots, long pants, and leather gloves since some of the ascent is on all fours.\nAlso bring a ton of water. \nI went through six-sixteen ounce bottles and ran out a couple miles before returning to The Gateway.\n\n\nHere's another tip. If you're by yourself, wear a bike helmet in case you go down. Also bring a cell phone and an old cd with you in case you fuck-up and break a leg or twist an ankle or something.\nYou can call for help and use the cd to flash signal the air ambulance.\n\nNote:\nThere's no trail to the top of McDowell Mountain from Windgate Pass, but you can follow an old barbed wire fence laying on the ground for a ways, starting just up from the pass.\nWhen you're finished with this achievement, head for Temple Bar, just down the street on Thompson Peak & Bell Roads where in a fitting salute the mountain's namesake, General Irvin McDowell, you'll slog down a couple beers and as many shots in his honor.\n\nGeneral Irvin McDowell. \nFamed Indian figher, West Point grad, and chronic alcoholic in his later years.\nDrink one for you and several for him.

When I went to order my latte, I had a few questions on steam temperature for my milk (I'm slightly picky about that) and he kindly answered them and executed my shots as requested.  As I was paying (cash, since they only allow debit/CC cards at a minimum of I think $5), he asked if we were going to stay there for the evening or just to-go.. me, total optimist, thinking he is going to offer us the wifi password or even a sample of something or just plain being friendly and talkative, was surprised when he said \""""yeah, because you have an outside drink and we don't allow those, so you'd have to leave\"""" adding a fake sorry face... my sister, next to me, holding her Starbucks water container filled with WATER...

3087,I love this place I always come to this one the service is great always nice and funny and more then happy to tip the food is basic dinner food with a not so basic taste fully recommend it for a midnight snack and a good time,1
3088,"I really love Kushi Bar, it's the kind of place that I wouldn't be embarrassed to take my old friends from Boston or New York to. The sweet potato fries are fantastic and the dipping sauce just adds fuel to my firey addiction to sriracha. For vegetarians, I recommend the house salad (kumquats!), kimchi tofu, mushrooms, curry veggie and rice bowl and wash it all down with the gin rickey.",1
3089,"They have lots of candies, but are pretty pricey.\nWhat I like best from sugar is their gelato.\nFor $5 you can get a tiny cup of gelato, I chose the strawberry one which is really good. Its light & refreshing, you can taste the quality of it, and all the strawberries as well, it's also sweet but not too\nsweet & has a sorbet texture. Perfect for a hot day in vegas!",1
3090,"Breakfast at this joint is wonderful. They offer a wide variety of delicious food at remarkably affordable price points. Specials abound and they even leave a coffee pot on your table!\n\nOur server, Dezarae, made the experience memorable. When we asked what was delicious she was so cute. Her excitement bubbled over. I took the first suggestion offered and was very, very happy. The Juan Tacos are robust in flavor, needing little to perfect them. I did sprinkle in a bit of the guac and salsa to try. Excellent stuff.\n\nI fork sampled the El Paso (an omelette with chorizo and green chilis) and one of the specials, Triple Berry French toast. I'm happy to report that the chorizo was spicy and not overcooked. The french toast was deep fried. Perhaps a heart attack in the making but I'd definitely try that solo.\n\nPortions here are large. Definitely shareable. But why would you do that? Go family style and try different things!",1
3091,"What happened to you, carnival? Almost 10 years ago, they were my favorite buffet. Seriously, the flavor, the options, and the service - it was all there. My plates were cleaned, the flavors were immense, and damn, were the desserts heavenly.\n\nFast forward now - even for their price, which is consider on the more affordable hotel buffets, just leaves me with a stomach that hurts. I like that they have so many options - seriously, you'll burn some of the calories just walking back and forth, searching for your table because you were too hungry to remember as you dashed to the seafood station. The taco station is a nice visit if you're interested in making your own tacos, hard shell and all.\n\nThe dessert station, which I used to be quite fond of, is now mediocre. It's like everything is just tossed together - no flavor. Just loaded with sugar and HFCS. The gelato is good, but I would say that about many other buffets serving gelato.\n\nYes, the lines are long. I never had a problem in the past because for the most part, I went through the Diamond line. And the few times I waited in the regular line, it was at odd times, so I barely waited. The wait isn't an issue - that's bound to happen at many other popular buffets.",0
3092,"Have eaten here several times and generally the food is pretty good. Not great, but good for a beer and burger place. The reason for the two stars is the wait staff. The last few times we have gone in we are met with an attitude of indifference at the door that seems to permeate the wait staff. Waited a long time to for our first contact with the waitress, though she was pleasant. Seems she had customers on the patio as well as inside and was spread thin, so it was a long time between visits. First beer came timely,  but could not get the attention of anyone for a refill when our food came. A different waitress dropped off our food (and that was literally what she did) and quickly turned away and did not ask if we needed anything else. Furthermore, she went out of her way to avoid our conspicuous attempts to get her attention for something we needed. In the meantime our first waitress was busy on the patio and, apparently, waitress #2 was not happy that she had to serve us our food, because she continued to ignore our attempt to get her attention, even glaring and looking through me at one point. Although this was \""""Trivia night\"""" (for the life of me I don't understand what a restaurant gets out of this since most participants seem to only buy drinks), the place was not crowded or busy and there seemed to be plenty of employees to go around the room and tend to the customers that were present. This is only an account of the third bad experience we have had with service. There have been others, interspersed with satisfactory experiences. \nWe both have many years in the restaurant business and our assessment of the reason for this uneven experience falls on management. First, choose people that are committed to the success of your business. There are many competitors out there waiting to take your place if you stumble. Second, management has the responsibility to make certain staff is well schooled in how to deal with customers, including the technique of scanning the room and making eye contact with those that seem to be looking for something. There are usually additional sales involved in doing this competently. Third, management needs to be present and observant so that when it is apparent things are not going well, they can do what they are paid to do, i.e. make it right. You only get so many bites at this apple HAPH, so you better get it right or Gilbert ends up with yet another vacant building with a \""""For Lease\"""" sign in the window.",0
3093,"Bought a groupon today, $15 for 30. Went to Stacy's at lunch & had my print out. Right away the gentleman behing the tall counter asked if that was a Groupon. I said yes, then he said very rudely \""""Oh we aren't taking those until Monday\"""". I said what. He said Yeah we ain't taking those till Monday. I said it doesn't say it on the Groupon. He said Yeah not till Monday. I was like are you serious, he said Yeah, that's coming from the higher up's. \n\nI chuckled and said ok. I mean if you are putting a Groupon out then you need to specify in the fine print a \""""start date\"""". We ended up sitting down for lunch and two other people came in with their Groupon. They were told the same thing, also in a rude manner. One gentleman was furious and stated the same thing I said, \""""it doesn't say that\"""". \n\nThe food was good, as this was my first time there. I had the lunch special, pulled pork sandwhich with potato salad. BUT.... the mac & cheese was NOT worth the $4 for an 8oz size. It tasted and looked like mac & cheese out of a box, like Kraft. That was very disappointing. Will I go back? Heck yeah, to redeem my Groupon, but after that, not really.",0
3094,Excellent food at this out of the way place. Portions  very large and fresh. I want to try everything on the menu. Plan to go back every weekend until I've tried all menu items. Coffee was also delicious and friendly servers,1
3095,"Only came here to use the complimentary $20 credit as a Luxor guest.\n\nWas already disappointed that they weren't open during the day or late night, only standard dinner hours really.\n\nHostess tells us we can sit in the lounge area, which is still full service or wait 10-15 minutes for the dining area, even though I saw a few empty tables there. We chose to sit in the comfy looking couches in the front lounge area.\n\nWe waited 15+ minutes for anything...water, menus...nobody. We saw two staff people walk by and even though they weren't our waiters, they could have informed whoever need be that we weren't being helped at all. Granted, we were hard to see as being blocked by a giant pole, but still. The bartender was in clear view in front of us, who could have informed any of the staff. My sister finally went up to the hostess to tell her that we had been waiting a long time without anyone coming by.\n\nOur waitress comes and gives us the menu and waters and while friendly, she didn't apologize at all for keeping us waiting.\n\nI order the yellowtail jalapeno roll and my sister had the veggie spring rolls, just enough to use the credit. Of course, these two small items, in which one doesn't even have to be cooked, took another 30+ minutes. During this time, a couple slips in through the side entrance and seats themselves next to us. A waitress notices them and asks if they would like to see the dinner menu and the couples says 'yes.' Well, they waited 15+ minutes and that waitress never came back and there goes the couple and future business.\n\nOur food finally comes, and it was actually good. My sushi roll didn't have too much rice and was rolled very well, as it didn't fall apart. Yellowtail and jalapeno were as plentiful as much as a roll could fit. The veggie spring rolls portion was much larger than anticipated and was jam packed with veggies.\n\nThe rest of our service was kinda alright? Water was refilled, but she still never asked us how we were doing, and didn't offer to take my empty plate away. Took a bit to get our check. Luckily, we had the credit and a bit of cash to cover a small tip and the tax, so we didn't have to wait any more at this bad establishment. Too bad, we actually enjoyed our food.",0
3096,"I have been to Vegas twice in the last 20 days for trade show. The first one the Magic show and the second one Super Zoo. Each time I stayed in a different hotel. \n\nI read up on Circus Circus, and as I was on a  budget I thought heck I can do it for 8 hours ( was actually in the room for only 8.5 hours total) The price seemed right... so I thought...\n\nNow Vegas is experiencing over 14% unemployment, at a tax rate of 10.5% which for some reason politicians never understand KILLS BUSINESS. TAXES KILL BUSINESS politicians please read and write this on the chalk board 5 thousand times!\n\nNot only is the tax rate just insane for this place, but the fees hotels sneak in is crazy and have to be driving business away. I know it making this girl think twice before I go again. Heck I might just camp next time that's how bad it is there, I think. \n\nSo back to CC, the actually charge you a fee for having a phone in your room... yes you read that right!! $1 gets you a phone! YIPPEE \nREAD BELOW\n\nThe following mandatory hotel-imposed fees are charged and collected by the hotel either at check-in or check-out: Telephone fee: $1 per room/night. The above list may not be comprehensive. Mandatory hotel-imposed fees may not include tax and are subject to change.\n\nThe total came to $32.34\nTAX $4.39!!! Just what are you dirt bag politicians doing with our money? Paying to get spanked? Oh that's right lobbyists pay you for them to get spanked and your vote... you just buy the drugs and put it under misc. from you slush funds\n\nBack to CC... sorry get side tracked... The beds if that is what you call them in CC. I really thought they were training me to be in the Circus to lay on a bed of nails or glass. THE SPRINGS in the MATTRESS could be felt, I think there was an 1/8th of fabric between me and the mattress... and I have some padding on my own bones...  again I would like to point out that I am a camper, so use to sleeping on the ground. This was sleeping on harsh springy metal! OUCH ALL NIGHT. I tried to sleep on my pillows even!\n\nThe room was pretty decent in being clean and not feeling like I was going to walk away with some skin rash or worse.  I think it is a few steps up from being a total loss and that is why they are not remodeling yet.\n\nI do have something positive to say tho. Their staff and security is great. Nice and personable folks. I had to change rooms due to a partying neighbor and they had no problem moving me and having security meet me to show me to my new room and someone bring me the new key card. My car was safe and I felt safe walking around outside.\n\nOf course the security guard looked like he most definitely worked out and was packing a 9mm Smith and Wesson! SEXY!\n\nIf you have to go cheep this is the place I think... if you need a comfortable bed do not go to this place unless you bring you camping mattress as well.",0
3097,Glad we stopped by.  Were already downtown and decided to give this a try. Glad we did. Service was great. Wasn't very busy so we received plenty of attention. I had the carne asada plate. Big enough to fill me up and have some left overs. Rice and beans were delicious. Meat was decent. Overall great experience and will surely return to try your their lunch menu.,1
3098,The atmosphere is fun and the service was good. The burger meat was good but the mushrooms are canned the cheese appears to be processed. The turkey sandwich was what gave it two stars. It was no better than one that came out of a vending machine.,0

3100,"I work in healthcare and it takes ALOT for me to feel let down by medical personnel. I don't know whether to blame the Dr or her staff. During my first visit, Dr Aragon was nice and thorough but it was obvious she was preoccupied. She ordered a lan and directed me to make appt to discuss it after it comes back. I got my labs drawn 7/31. Waited 1 week, no response. Called on 8/7 and was told I had to leave a message, left message, waited 1 week with no response.  Called back on 8/15 and was told someone would call back after Dr was done \""""reviewing\"""" my labs. Come 9/9 still nothing! I call and told them I wanted to pick up my labs to take to another Dr and was told \""""well, we usually don't call if the labs are normal\"""" which contradicts what Dr Aragon said.

A moment of silence while she reviews it, \""""Oh! Well...I'm looking at it and you should definitely come in and talk to the Dr about it!\"""" REALLY?

3102,"Three words: FISH FRY FRIDAY.\n\nHave you ever been to a backwoods bar in Wisconsin that has an all-you-can-eat fish fry on a Friday night for practically nothing?\n\nIf you answered \""""no\"""" to that question, then I invite you to experience the Peoria Cafe. It's the next best thing, right here in Arizona!  What you will get is reasonable prices, friendly service, and a good, old-fashioned Friday night fish fry.\n\nThe downside is that they only serve until 8 (?!?!) and I don't think they serve alcohol; everyone knows that a truly awesome fish fry is complimented by a brandy old-fashioned and/or a microbrew.  I would give a few points for their delicious home-made ranch dressing.\n\nMy advice: pre-drink and head over to the Peoria cafe for a great fried fish dinner!",1
3103,"I shopped around quite extensively to find a great engadgement ring. I found Brian at the perfect time.

3105,"I was a little worried going in because I've read good reviews about other restaurants from fellow Yelpers and came away unimpressed but everything I read about Del Frisco's was true.  This place is amazing!  My friends and I called for a reservation the day of and did not have a problem getting a table considering it was a Friday night.  We waited only a few minutes after getting there before we were seated at our table.\n\nThey have the most professional staff working here, our server, JP, was so attentive and answered any question we had about the menu and even recommended which steak I should try.  I ended up ordering the 22 oz. bone-in rib eye cooked medium and it was the best piece of meat I have ever had.  I'm sure you're thinking I'm exaggerating but I'm not, this steak was THAT good.... the real deal.  And it made me feel a little better knowing that my $50 was well spent.  Everything else was just a bonus.  We had a slice of the lemon cake which was good but a little too sweet for me.  It was more than enough for five people.\n\nI can't say enough good things about this place.  I highly recommend Del Frisco's to anyone willing to try it.  Who cares about the price... you only live once.  I can't wait to go back, my mouth waters just thinking about it....",1
3106,"I used to love Southwest Airlines but lately they aren't getting it for my travel.  While they used to tout being one of the most on time airlines now I cannot remember the last time I was not delayed.\n\nI really like their gate attendants, flight attendants, and their whole philosophy on flying BUT if you cannot get me their on time then I can't continue to use you.  Because Southwest stacks their flights so close if one flight is delayed you are almost guaranteed to miss the next one.\n\nUnfortunately the last 5 flights I have had with them have been either delayed or canceled.  I cannot use them for business any more because of the importance of being on time so I only use them for the short hauls and family trips.\n\nThe one good thing I can say is that when I called their customer service, they owned that they have had some issues with their on time performance and that they are making changes.  They were very friendly and said they wanted to earn our business back SO I hope that I can update this review later on and say things have improved.",0
3107,"Usually they're good. Not today that's for sure. So irritated. Long story short my dog goes in once a week for a mite bath. Last week it was $48, this week it was $50. It's the principal. \n\nI also wanted them to cut his nails today. They say they did but I know they didn't, they look exactly the same. Had receptionist confirm they were cut, came back saying they did but since the quick was so long...ok, if the quick is so long why cut them at all? I'm well aware of the quick btw. Why not wait until next time when they've grown a little more rather than charge me for doing nothing. Makes no sense. I wanted them to take him back and cut them again. If I'm not happy with something make it right.  Nope, I paid and now I'm pissed. \n\nLastly nobody calls me to tell me they're done with the dog. I have to call them. Usually atleast twice. First time they left me on hold so long I hung up. I don't know what their problem was today but what a disappointment.",0
3108,"A chic shopping center with a nice selection of restaurants, household wares, and clothing stores, just to name a few. Although the setup of the park means you'll be walking outside from store to store, it's shaded and scenic enough that you won't mind so much during the scorching summer months. A plus of this center is that they allow dogs around the shopping areas, although I haven't tried to take my dogs into any stores except the excellent Petique pet supply/adoption store. The addition of the Union area of the Biltmore caters to a younger crowd, housing such stores as Smeeks and the delicious Whoopie Baking Company.",1

Customer service, although not required is definitely appreciated and noted to make a world of difference.\n\nAllow me to relay my adventure the first night in Sin City....\n\nThere were six of us, all beautiful girls, enjoying ourselves.  We went out to dinner, we enjoyed a show, we got dolled up and we were ready for some dancing action.  Being a group of beautiful girls, all we had to do to was show a little leg to get into the hottest clubs on the strip.\n\nI got lost in the music, dancing and alcohol for hours before I realized that I was missing something essential in my small dancing purse.  Dude where's my wallet and phone?!?!  Snapped out of my intoxicated haze, I patrolled the club and harrassed security with no luck.  With nothing left to do, I returned to the Venetian tired and defeated.\n\nMy exhausted group decided to go back to the room while I inquire at the front desk about a business center.  I am a responsible mature young lady; I needed to notify my five credit/debit cards that my wallet was missing.\n\nThe front desk lady, whose name I did not catch, was Caucasian with medium long hair, tall, thin and working the hours between 3-4 am deserves an award and to be recognized.  When I told her of my misfortune, she not only found all five customer service numbers on her computer, dialed the numbers for me and waited patiently as I struggled to talk to ppl who may not reside in the country.  Once I had my card situation figured out, I had the audacity to ask if she can call long distance to my boyfriend so I can let him know that I am unavailable.. lost phone and all.\n\nThere could never be a more appreciative drunken fool to have stumbled through the Venetian than me that night.  Yes the Venetian is a beautiful facility with great rooms and a central location on the strip, but it is that lady who has earned my loyalty.\n\nA word about the room... We stayed in the Rialto suite - two full size beds, pull out sectional, two TVs.  The bathroom is large, separate shower and bath tub and private room for toilet. \n\nDon't worry, some extremely good samaritan turned in my phone/wallet to security with ID, cash and credit card intact.

The quality of fish is excellent.  I also had the udon noodle soup which I split with my mom.  It was the perfect accompaniment to a chilly winter day.  You can split it easily, and they bring you the bowls and spoons to do so.  It even has a soft boiled egg in it! Yummy\n\nThe menu has more than standard rolls, there are a lot of fusion rolls to choose from!\n\nThey also had hot green tea that was so good.\n\nThis place is intimate and welcoming, definitely worth becoming a regular at!",1
3123,I went with a friend the other day and was really happy.\n\nIt's affordable (I hate the term cheap) and excellent.  \n\nI had the black bean burger and a cup of asparagus and mushroom soup.  It might have been the best soup I've ever had and the black bean burger was completely different than any that I've had before. I think it had something extra like fava beans to give it better texture and flavor.\n\nMy friend had the salmon burger which was also amazing (stole a bite).\n\nI think our total with both sandwiches and two excellent cups of coffee with soy creamer (yay!) was about $20.,1
3124,"Disgustingly overpriced, massive salon with shitty customer service. They want your money and they want you out. THEY DO NOT STERILIZE THE TOOLS. I have an infected toe after getting a pedicure there two days ago and I've never had any sort of foot ailment in my life. Thumbs all the way the fuck down.",0
3125,"I was very happy with my sales person and my purchase. They were not high pressure  and the ring and diamond I purchased were a higher quality and better price than other places I had been. \n\nIt doesnt stop there either, the  warranty plan we recieved was FREE and does not require us to bring the ring in at scheduled intervals to keep the warranty valid (Other stores charged for warranty plans and required the item be brought in every 6 months for a cleaning and checkup to keep the warranty valid). After about 2 years my wife noticed one of the smaller stones had fallen out so I took the ring back and they replaced the stone no questions asked. Also we can take it back at anytime for a cleaning. \n\nI would highly recommend anyone to at least visit Shane Co. when they are looking for any jewlery item.",1
3126,They have great food! Always clean in the store and you can even call ahead your order so you don't have to wait while they cook it fresh! Its not to long of a wait but at times it can be so to have this option available I love! This location is VERY hard to find though! More signs!!!!,1
3127,"I was visiting from Los Angeles for my little sister's birthday & was skeptical because I'm usually a \""""stick with what I know\"""" kind of person.

3128,"When with such importunity the reference of fresh fruits(in the breakfast menu), do bring forth only of well described produce. The cut honeydew and cantaloup melons we're clearly overrippen per the squishy texture and the translucide blemishes around the edges. My wife had the smoked meat plate. The sandwich is flavorful but irrelevant when the cole slaw tasted expired.  \nAlas, the waitress was quite pleasant and attended well her patrons.",0

They have good sandwiches too.",1
3130,"I don't know what is wrong with people giving this place 1 or 2 stars complete wackos, because my girlfriend and I have been eating here as regulars for 3 years the food is always excellent maybe some things slip but it's probably because the place is so busy has nothing to do with the food.We will always recommend this establishment.",1
3131,"This jem is hidden in the back of a shopping center. Inside you will find yourself in an awesome coffee shop with a unique vibe. I love independent coffee shops, so I already knew I loved this place. The menu doesn't look that plentiful, but I heard people ordering things that were not on there. You can tell them to make anything your heart desires. The coffee is a little over priced, but worth it because it is an independent coffee shop and it tastes great. This is a great study spot. It gets packed though so you may have a hard time finding a chair or table. This place is a haven for hipsters and students. All are welcome though!",1
3132,"Was at the Phoenician for a meeting and it was excellent. It is a very high quality spa/resort with amazing golf and tennis courts. The service is outstanding and the food simply fantastic. It doesn't need another review, since everyone on here seems to have loved their stay as well, but just wanted to add another 5 stars to the Phoenician. Go there to relax and indulge if you are in the southwest and are looking for a great place to stay.",1
3133,"We went on a Saturday morning and had to wait almost an hour to be seated.  My egg white omelette was runny, so I sent it back.  We are now an hour and twenty minutes into our dining experience and I still have no food that is edible.  When the omelette returned, they had done something to the eggs to make them ultra-fluffy, which sounds like it would be good, but it wasn't.  It was literally like eating a kitchen sponge.  My son and husband got pancakes and said that the ones we make at home are better.\n\nOh, I should add that we went to the one by the Target near uptown.",0
3134,"Thanks for the heads up about this place.  I decided to check it out after reading several people who posted.  It's a simple place with pretty good food.  It was too hot to eat outside but they do have a nice patio with umbrellas.  I'll remember that when the Phoenix winters come around.  I ordered the roast beef with carmelized onion sandwich and I thought it was very good.  It came with a side dish.  I also had a coupon for 20% off which I downloaded and printed after clicking on their website from the Yelp review.  So, take advantage of that savings.  Thanks fellow Yelpers!",1
3135,"After living in central Phoenix for almost 30 years I just moved 2 weeks ago to Paradise Valley. After hearing so many positive comments I decided to check it out with a friend. \n\nTheir website is impressive, it's in a high-end shopping area, and it appears they advertise as being the ultimate luxury movie experience. AND their website said they were showing one of my favorite classic comedies \""""The Philadelphia Story\""""! I was very excited.\n\nI paid $48 for 2 tickets since the Premium Plus Seating looked incredible.\n\nWalking in the theater is very impressive with the conceige desk-style ticketing and the bar and restaurant on either side. Very nice. I had purchased our tickets online and since both people at the counter were with other customers I went to the electronic kiosk and swiped my credit card. Here's where the problems began that I will bulletpoint out below. Plus I will contrast and compare my IPic experience with my history at AMC Esplanade, supposedly IPic's poor cousin.\n\n1) Visual experience entering the theater and \""""fancy level\""""....ADVANTAGE: IPIC\n\n2) Cost of highest level of seating...$24 per person at iPic, $16.56 at AMC. ADVANTAGE: AMC  \n\n2) The kiosk read that my tickets were printed but no tickets were printed. I waited at the counter and it took the young lady a few minutes to undertand what I was telling her had happened. She finally found our tickets and while handing them to me said \""""That kiosk is broken. I need to put a sign on it.\""""  (I have never experienced a broken kiosk in the dozens of times I have visited AMC Esplanade. Getting your tickets purchased online from the ticket desk takes seconds.) ADVANTAGE: AMC  \n\n3) We get to our $48 movie theater seats and discover the chairs are not that wide and they do not recline very far because the row in front of you is very close. I am 6'1\"""" and I was unable to recline my cloth-covered seat very far as my feet would have been on top of the guy's head sitting in front of me. (The Cinema Suits seats at AMC Explanade have a wide aisle in front and behind each row and the people in front and behind you are a complete level above and behind you. The AMC chairs are fake leather, wider than IPic, and recline almost complete flat.) ADVANTAGE: AMC  \n\n4) During our film, the music and sound effects of the movie in the theater on one side of ours was booming and thumping on and off repeatedly during our film. It was extremely distracting. (I have noticed the same thing at AMC Esplanade but not to that extreme level). ADVANTAGE: AMC  \n\n5) I went to the Men's room during the film. Nice restroom like in a fancier restaurant. The stall had a cool frosted glass door. Unfortuately, there was a huge wad of used TP next to the toilet and the paper seat covers had all been pulled out and halfway shoved back in. When I went to the restroom at the end of the film the stall was in the same condition. Also, for what is supposed to be a north Scottsdale upscale movie theater experience, why can't iPic give its customers better than the gauze-like half a ply TP they use? (The iPic restroom was much fancier than AMC Esplanade's but AMC keeps their restrooms much cleaner on a continual basis). ADVANTAGE: AMC\n\n6) Our popcorn was served in tiny paper sacks. It had no taste like it was air popped. Tasteless popcorn in a small paper bag. Wow....how upscale. (AMC Esplanade has great popcorn that they serve in large bowls). ADVANTAGE: AMC\n\n7) I asked for a Coke Zero and was told they only carried Coke and Diet Coke. You don't carry one of the best selling sodas in the world? My Diet Coke came in a cheap plastic takeout cup. (AMC Esplanade has Coke Zero and serves it in a real glass). ADVANTAGE: AMC\n\n8) When our movie ended the DVD menu for the film immediately popped up. We commented on how it seemed a little strange and laughed about wondering if they had secured the rights for a public viewing of the DVD. It felt a little weird.\n\n9) Theater location for iPic is in the swanky and beautiful Scottsdale Quarter. (AMC Esplanade is in the struggling Esplanade but across the street from the Biltmore Shopping Center. ADVANTAGE: iPic but only barely.\n\n10) iPic parking garage is about a block away. (AMC Esplanade has an elevator and stairs that take you just feet from the theater doors). If you're lazy ADVANTAGE: AMC\n\nThe overall parts of our iPic experience seemed extremely incongruous to the luxury moviegoing experience that iPic advertises. It was a hugely disappointing experience and felt like a complete waste of $48. I wish I had asked for my money back. I will never visit iPic again and will instead go back to AMC Esplanade in the future.",0
3136,"The food was very good and it's a cool building, but the service was terrible.  The hostess was not at all friendly and we were seated at a very uncomfortable high top table and got some attitude when we asked to move.  There was hardly anyone in there, so there were plenty of regular tables.  The server didn't even ask if we wanted refills or dessert, just slapped the bill on the table.  I actually was going to get both, but fine I won't spend any more money there.",0
3137,The best deal in Rusans is their $10 buffet! I tried it and its completely worth it:)\nTheir sushi is good! i personally prefer their tempura rolls and my favorite Kiss of fire roll. The only con about this place is that its not good for big groups. They always run into issues whenever we are more than 6 people on accomodating us. Also the ambience is too loud.. I do enjoy it but sometimes it gets annoying.\nOverall iits a good place to eat!,1
3138,"Service was mediocre at best. Only had 4 water glasses delivered to table for a 6-top. Had to ask 3 times for extra water, still didn't get delivered. Had to get up to get my own water. After I received my water, the glass had residue from coca cola still stuck to the inside of the glass. Appetizers came out with the food instead of before. Breakfast Bacon was floppy, extremely undercooked. When I sent it back to the kitchen less than a minute later the bacon came out again, more cooked however unless they had 3 identical pieces of bacon already cooking in the kitchen, they just threw the bacon in the microwave to cook more, or they have bacon sitting under a heat lamp. My table ordered a grilled cheese with bacon. Got back a single piece of melted cheese with a pile of undercooked bacon shoved between two slices of bread. Ordered French toast. The toast was sogged all the way through with batter and completely undercooked. Some of the food was OK, nothing spectacular. To say the least, this restaurant doesn't deserve the title of best coffee house/diner from the Las Vegas Review Journal.",0
3139,"My friend and were guest at the MGM,we checked in Thursday and stayed until Sunday. Friday we went to the wet republic were my friends purse was taken,we spent about 3 hours filling reports etc...my friend needed to buy new makeup because it was in the purse,when she went to buy new makeup she told a lade that worked at the MGM that her credit card was canceled because her purse was taken, we received a phone call that we need to check out of the hotel because they assumed we had no method of payment.We went to talk to the people at the check out desk to ask why they would check us out with out talking to us,all they said was basically to bad for us. We payed for our stay in cash,it was not a problem to do so.THe people at the hotel were os no help to help us find the purse, all they car about is them self,and if we had no cash we would of been out on street,everything was in the purse ATM cards create cards etc.... This is just not write the security at the hotel dropped the ball at the pool, and then they want to kick us out!!!! I will never stay at the MGM.\nAlso they over crowd there clubs, service sucks,and you can't even get water, they make you buy it for$6 a bottle, it's so hot water should free!!",0
3140,"We made reservation for our anniversary and first trip to Las Vegas. After looking at mixed reviews on this restaurant we decided there was more good to be said than bad....WHAT A MISTAKE. We were sat at a white tableclothed table to find what at first looked like a lot of black pepper everywhere....until it started moving. CAMELOT STEAKHOUSE had ants on the table, napkins, and in our glasses. When we brought that to the attention of the waiter he asked us to move to another table...why would we still eat here? I found the \""""manager\"""" and he said \""""What? Which table??\"""" And walked away. We just left. It was a horrifying experience. I will contact the food health department about this.",0
3141,"Best Korean I've had yet in Vegas. The Dumpling Tofu soup was divine. I asked for spicy and got it! The food arrived sizzling to the table. I love every single side they give complimentary. You can really fill up for $10. a person. The Short Ribs were the bomb! The staff is wonderful. I love the ambiance and decor, everything, even the simple wooden chairs. There's two sides to Tofu Hut, the BBQ table and regular. The late hours are a plus! I will come back frequently, now that I know of this gem. I will bring friends. I'm gonna try the BBQ next time.",1
3142,"This was definitely the best Indian food I've had in a long while. Went with some coworkers while at a conference and was impressed with the dish selection, descriptions to aid some of the folks in the group who hadn't had much Indian food, and the helpful service. In a sea of glitz and glamour on the strip, this was a refreshing winner!",1
3143,"I've been to Vegas a bunch of times and have always gotten a table/bottles and rarely had to wait in line so my review may be biased. Of all the clubs I've been to in Vegas (which is a lot) Jet would have to be at the bottom of my list for  a couple reasons, mind you we got one of the best tables on a sat night in the club at the time as well:\n\n1. It's a weird crowd and the people were ghetto..  Im not the one to judge normally but in Vegas and from the times I've been out, you see some pretty damn good looking people out and there were few and far between.  I dont want to see the people I saw dancing on the stripper pole in the middle of the dance floor... its just wrong\n\n2. The music was not good.  I dont know who was Djing but the music did not rile me up and I usually have a good ear for whats good and gets people dancing/having fun.  Not sure what they were playing but there were way too many people standing around.\n\n3. The layout of the club is like a box.  Nothing special, nothing fancy, just a regular club.  If I go to Vegas I expect to see/feel like Im at a club that I cant experience at home.\n\n4. The place is a lot more smoky than other clubs.  Maybe a vent/air filtration issue?\n\nThe one good thing about the place was our cocktail waitress and the fact that since the club wasnt good (I mentioned something about that) even after we finished the bottles they let us stay at our table. She also brought us a free round of shots.  Sweet but not enough to get me back there.... actually dont think they could do anything to get me and my friends back there.\n\nI would definitely go somewhere else if you want to experience Vegas nightlife, there are tons of other clubs - Tao, Pure, Tryst, Body English, you get my point..\n\nCouple things when reading reviews - people shouldnt completely weigh their rating on a Vegas club because they got in FREE, the drinks drinks are too expensive, or how long they had to wait in line. For the best clubs, of course you're going to wait in line (if you dont have a table), everyone wants to get in..  Its like a popular or nice restaurant... if you want to eat there, you better be willing to spend the money and book a reservation far in advance or walk in and be prepared to wait hours to get a open table. Also drinks are going to be expensive, its Vegas.  What should really matter are the reasons why you go to a Vegas club: MUSIC, WOMEN/MEN, VIBE, SERVICE.",0
3144,"There's literally only two reasons to ever go to the Galeries du Parc. One of them is the Cin\u00e9ma du Parc, probably the best rep house in the city, and the Spicy Noodle. Fast, dirt cheap and delicious.  Location's a bit weird, but if you're in the McGill Ghetto area, there's no reason to swing by.",1
3145,This is my 3rd time here so I finally decided to leave a review. Food is great. Great atmosphere. Awesome pancakes! I had cookies and cream special this morning and it was spot on Oreos lol. It's a real cozy place (small ) so if your claustrophobic you might be slightly uncomfortable lol. But I def recommend it my only think they should improve on is the bacon wasn't that impressed but overall everything was too notch!,1
3146,Usually my stop before heading into my account if I am working the night shift.  The food is a'ight.  I usually just get a bean and cheese burrito and often find that the cheese isn't melted.  Which is crazy that it isn't warmer considered how long the wait is.,0
3147,"Good doctor but horrible care. \n\nDr. Swainston's office is horribly managed. From three hours waits for appointments,  to \""""forgetting\"""" to send prescriptions to the pharmacy to \""""forgetting\"""" to follow up on positive lab test results, and \""""forgetting\"""" that you are there for an appointment, they are the worst run medical practice I have ever seen. \n\nI understand that some of the problem may stem from the fact that Dr. Swainston is a good surgeon and he has a busy practice. But lots of doctors have busy practices yet they have adequate competent staffing. You can never get access to him and it's almost impossible to even get the attention of a nurse. You have to double check everything that is being done as they promise to do things and then do it wrong or never do it at all. You have to constantly be on hold only for them to take a message and then not bother calling you back. \n\nFor a prescription that was supposed to have several refills authorized, I had to call nurse to get it, called twice without a call back, and finally gave up trying to get the nurse. I got an appointment to see the doctor to try to get it filled, get told that they had sent it in and that pharmacy had made a mistake, told me they would resend it to make sure, never sent it, had to wait for 4 days over a long weekend to get a nurse to call me back to try to get it authorized. Why does it take over a half dozen phone calls and an additional doctor visit to follow up just to get one prescription that was supposed to have refills already to get written properly? Why does it have to take 6 hours out of my life to get one prescription properly filled?\n\nThis is just one example. \n\nI had a surgery with Dr. Swainston several months ago. I had a lot of complications. And I believe that all of them were due to the fact there was not proper care before and after the surgery. So does it matter how good a surgeon is if the pre-care and post-care is crappy? I suffered needlessly for months due to their bad care. \n\nIf you have any other choice, avoid this doctor. He's good but his team is clearly overwhelmed and/or does not care enough to improve the care it gives it's patients. It's just not worth it. It's really a nightmare dealing with them. I am so glad I no longer need to deal with their practice again.",0
3148,"What a great find! A very reasonable price good for the entire family. The food was better than I expected. No wonder there was a long line. I got too full I couldn't get to the famous oxtail soup that everyone is raving about. Well, next time. My favorite was their Kahlua Pork and chocolate cake!!",1
3149,"This place is over lated... My husband and I decided to try this place because the review is high and i always love to try a new spot(especially the japanese one)\nWhen we arrived,there were 3 groups(not including us)and a customer at the bar. Looked like 2 groups were already done, they were just talking.\n\nWe orderd Green salad,Kaeaage,Shrimp tempura roll,Hamachi-kama,Gyu-tan-sushi and Ikura-sushi.We also tried Samuel Smith's apple cider beer.It was really good!\nWhen we finish ordering, 2groups left the restaurant,so it was just us,the other and some at the bar.\n\nThe first thing I thought was 'How many people working in this restaurant?'\nI saw at lease 5people working around the floor.\nI understand it's because they want to care every customers I think.\nand I thought everybody who works at the restaurant was nice in the beginning.\n\nWe got a salad first,it was okay,nothing special,but I loved pear in it.\nSecond,Karaage was served.We liked little spicy tast.\nThen... we WAITED so long to get our entire meal!!!!!(over an hour!!!)\nand at this point,the server started to avoid us.\nWe of cause finished karaage(we are not fast eater.we eat dishse slowly especialy when we drink alcohol.) and we kinda sarted getting annoyed.I don't know why it took sooo long to make our dishes.When the restaurant is really busy,I totally understand,BUT this slow and I don't think the other group orderd a lot of food.\nWhen the manager came to our table,I asked her about our sushi,roll and kama,then she saied 'We want you to forcus our dishse one by one'\nREALLY???\nWe were too tired to forcus each dishes.\nFinally,we got sushi,roll and kama.(It didn't come at one time,we waited so long to get each dishes.)Our mood was already bad and we wanted to get out here,so It maybe is good tast,but we didn't feel any good ways especially the kama was not tast good.\nI think every server noticed that our mood is not good,so nobody came to our table so it was hard to get our check.then I put my card with my bill,nobody returned so I changed to pay by cash.\n\nYou got many servers,why nobody can care us???or\nNobody care us,why you got many servers???\nBAD SERVICE!!!!!We will never come back.\n\nWhy 2stars?\nBecause one server brought us a fruits dish.She didn't say because of the slow service,she just told us it is free.but it can't cover all our bad experience here.",0
3150,"When I was the young age of 3, my mom brought me to YC's. I have been going ever since. This place is such a pleasant change from all the typical restaurants where you sit down, order from a set menu, and then get served your meal. Here you get to branch out and build your own Mongolian stir-fry from a huge selection of raw ingredients from the buffet style food line. There's meat, tons of vegetable selections, other toppings, and various types of noodles to add. But the personalization doesn't stop there. You then get to create your own sauce either on your own or using any of YC's own personal recipes. At this point, you hand over your bowl to one of their \""""grill warriors\"""" and watch them bring your stir-fry to life on the giant grills. The finished product always is perfectly cooked, has epic taste and flavor because it has EXACTLY what you want, and keeps you coming back! YC's also has crispy wontons, rice, and chopsticks (of course) to complete the meal! This is a place I will never get tired of because the possibilities are endless. Their facility is always clean and staff is welcoming and helpful. Not to mention, it is very affordable. I highly recommend everyone to \""""mongo\"""" at YC's Mongolian Grill!",1
3151,"An exceptional value!  I have been meaning to try this place for a while, and I am glad I finally got around to it!  I found this restaurant to be a perfect combination of fast food and casual dining.  There are nice, clean tables and a pleasant atmosphere.  Our waiter was very competent and friendly.  The food was not exceptionally high quality, but it was GOOD and it was filling and large.  I ate a falafel pita boat wrap, which was delicious and large for about $4.  This place is perfect for students on a budget, but the food is very good too!",1
3152,"What a fabulous hotel!!!! Best hotel room I've ever stayed in...period! I've flown well over a million miles and stayed many places including Ritz Carlton's, Four Seasons, 5-star resorts in Hawaii, and the room I stayed in here topped them all. The bed itself is to die for! You can actually buy it at the Home Store in the hotel and I plan on it. I slept better than I ever have before. Everything in the room was top notch, very high quality and great design, just like the entire hotel. I haven't stayed at the Venetian or Pallazo yet, so I can't compare. I am staying at Caesars now, and my room at the Encore was vastly superior in every way. The Encore is more expensive per night Han the other hotels on the strip, but you get what you pay for. You owe it to yourself to check it out at least once.",1
3153,"I came here for Taiwanese style breakfast and I thought everything was good. \n\nThe space is on the second floor of the strip mall in Chinatown. The ambiance is your typical Chinese place. Not dirty, not immaculate, Asian style decor, well lit, small and large tables. \n\nWe ordered the fried dough with soy milk for dipping, the roasted peanuts and anchovies which normally goes with congee but we ate it straight as a snack, the rice ball, egg crepe and soup dumplings. The soup dumplings were average but the other items were good and satisfied my craving. \n\nTrue, their tabletop chili oil is not as hot but I've been told that's the Taiwanese style and I believe there is beauty in every hot sauce. \n\nThe service was lacking but not horrible. They only had two servers staffed so they did what they could and at least brought the food out promptly. You don't go to Asian restaurants for their smiling service. It's efficient and to the point.",1

The head waiter was very indifferent to us, he spent much time at his other tables but only came to ours 3 times (ordering,salads, check) Food; the florida crab claws were great, the caesar salad dressing was very good but flat lettuce swimming in dressing does not make a salad  worth eating, the chef special bone-in filet was a beautiful piece of meat that was wasted by bad cooking, i order medrare, was med+ on the edges to nearly raw at the bone, waiter never came by to check on us or our meal.waiter finally showed up, with a $400 bill, no dessert, no happy birthday, not evan a kiss",0

Portions are very small, we ordered the braised rib we got one piece which was about 3 inches by 3 inches over mashed potatoes cost $8. I understand small plates but most tapas restaurants plates are at least large enough for 2 people to share. At best the food is bland  and not worth the prices they charge. I certainly hope they rework the food. I don't mind paying more for really good food, but I do mind being overcharged for poor food.

Delicious!!\n\nI wanted to try some tacos but it was damn hot--have to save something for next time right? \n\nIf you see this guy parked in a shopping center near you--do yourself a favor and stop by!!",1
3162,"Worst pizza in Vegas at this price. Mediocre service. And I'm almost positive \""""burned\"""" isn't a flavor. And pizza snobs, save it. I lived in Italy for a year and no self respecting Italian, from Napoli or anywhere else, would eat this garbage. How bad was it?  They didn't even ask how it was.

3163,"I have been very happy with Dawg Days.  The outside is not attractive but the inside is very dog friendly.  We've been taking our dog to get his hair cut there for over a year.  We used to take him to Pet Smart, who nicked him with the razor on 2 occasions and sent us home with a bleeding dog and not a word of explanation.  Dawg Days is family owned, and they genuinely care about the dogs, and when our dog gets nervous, they don't traumatize him.  We just got a second dog and he was terrified of the razor, so they gave him a haircut by HAND and didn't charge us any extra.  They keep the dogs in an open pen indoors and don't lock them in metal crates.  The staff is frequently in with the dogs giving them love and attention.  Our dog is afraid to walk into Pet Smart, but in the last year has never become afraid of Dawg Days, and has never come home bleeding.  It's hard, but don't judge this place by the outside, we have been very happy with their services.",1
3164,This place is overrated. I have been here twice to eat dinner with few friends and the flavors are honestly whatever. I would much rather have In & Out over this place.\n\nBurgers I have tried:\nHell's Kitchen Burger - little bit of kick to it but nothing to write home about\n\nAmerican Burger - just a standard burger that costs $13 dollars. I could have grilled something like this in my backyard.\n\nSides: Truffle Parmesan Fries - these are below average truffle fries. I've had good truffle fries and these have a very very light truffle flavoring. Not Good. The dipping sauce is good.\n\nJust Fries - these are standard french fries. Can't go wrong with this.\n\nThere are much better Burger places in L.A. that are half the cost then this place. Holstein's at Cosmo is much better.,0
3165,I had high expectations for my Vegas vacation.

3167,"What I love about concept galleries like Wyland is that it brings you to an entirely different world just as you enter. On one wall were simple drawings of sea creatures like turtles and whales that may not have been so striking at first glance until you look closely and see how meticulous the artist was to details. Sculptures surrounded the gallery, one of which was of a bear. The saleslady, Yuka, pointed out that Wyland carved only 750 copies of the it and sure prices were high (a staggering $1500 for a sculpture smaller than a spalding basketball) but it seemed worth it! Other paintings felt abstract, seemingly mimicking ocean waves and tropical essences.\n\nBy now you might be wondering what the artist stands for and I'll sure as anything tell you that he's doing all his work for a good cause. To an environmental geek like me, knowing that a certain percentage of all the painting's proceeds go toward environmental conservation and protecting ocean wildlife only further magnifies my interest. I consulted Yuka about Wyland's background and she willingly talked me through his past works and experience as a deep sea scubadiver. Some of the whale sculptures were carved in such detail that even texture was emphasized - as with the whales and turtles. \n\nIt was definitely not the last of my visits. Yuka informed me about a meet and greet with Wyland on June 16-17 and till then, I will always think highly of this place and recommend it to anyone who loves art that feels refreshing and alive.",1
3168,"All around my favorite resort casino in Vegas. First off, great casino with lots of options and even reasonable minimums. The interior of the casino/hotel is amazing. They have lots of statues and paintings and really fall in line with the Roman Theme. The forum shops are great and include many of the popular designers with helpful sales personel. And finally, the buffet. The number #1 rated buffet in Vegas and it is well worth the $50 you spend to get in. Crab legs, sushi, steak, ribs, lamb, tacos, muscles, clams, pastas, you name it they have it and it all tastes as though it was ordered as an individual entre.",1
3169,"From what I understand, Yelp is to review unique and fun places, not your typical everyday joints. For this review, and those rules, please accept my apology. What I have to say must be heard.\n\nYou see, Arby's is an amazing place. It is lumped in with the McDonalds and Burger Kings of the world, when in fact, it should hold a different place in the hearts of Americans. \n\nWhen I was 16 years old I landed my first real paper paycheck job at an Arby's in Holland, MI. I thought I was big time. I made $8.00 an hour. I scored free grub from time to time. I flirted with the lizadies who came through the drive through window. What else could you want? \n\nThrough my time at Arby's I learned a man named Russ Umphimheimer owns the most Arby's under an umbrella corporation called RTM. He also owned a few other joints I think a Hardees (never seen one), a breakfast roll place, etc. Arby's was his crowning achievement though. He owned an empire of roast beef and curly fries. I met him once and shook his hand. He had a bunch of gold rings. \n\nAnyway, now you have the background of my review, and you see I am only giving this joint 2 stars, you have to wonder why. I will tell you why..  no green beans on the menu.\n\nThrough out parts of the mid-west and the south there are renegade rebel Arby's. They were not bought out by RTM during Russ Umphenhimer's Arby's empire take over. Think of these places as the rebel alliance in Star Wars, and the RTM Arby's as The Empire. Russ Umphenhimer can be Darth Vader if you want him to be, but he's really not that mean. \n\nRTM (stands for Results Through Motivation) set a menu standard through out his millions of Arby's. Every menu had to be the same. You can always tell when you are in a rebel Arby's because they will have some random stuff on the menu, such as green beans. The franchisee operator will sell you green beans (at least they used to), but hardly any of the Arby's would order them because they were all RTM Arby's and thus, couldn't be free to set the menu as they saw fit. \n\nThis Arby's had it's typical roast beef sandwiches. I opted for the beef and cheddar sans red ranch sauce, cause I think it's gross and I saw somebody dump a whole tub on their head once and run around chasing a girl. Bad juju right there. I also ordered the chicken fingers, which are back on the menu after a couple year MIA stint. Topped it off with an order of curly fries and a jamoca shake. I can't spell jamoca. Sorry. \n\nThe food I ordered was great for a fast food joint, and worth the extra dollar to upgrade me from a whopper or big mac. However, to have a truly 5 star Arby's experience, I lust for the day where I can order green beans off of a fast food menu and have a hearty chuckle about this fact. Until this day, fight The Empire, and support your local rebel Arby's (they usually have those old signs \""""Arby's Rost Beef Sandwich is Delicious\"""").",1

3171,"Old, dirty, unfriendly, unaccomadating. Never again, EVER! When we arrived for check in at 3:30 on Thursday we were told by a Michelle G, who checked us in, that there were were no longer any king size bedrooms available, which is what we had reserved. This left me to wonder whether the guests waiting in the gigantic and growing line behind me were going to be told the same thing and how pissed everyone was going to be, right? My husband asked how that was possible and the chick had the audacity to tell us that technically check is 3 but no one is guaranteed their room until 6 pm!! Seriously?! Then why isn't check in at 6?! That was ridiculous. She must've thought we were stupid or something. She treated us like second class citizens and this really disappointed me. Well after my husband refused to budge, she made a call and magically found a king size bedroom available. She took no responsibility, made no apologies and frankly looked mad at us for some reason! Talk about quality customer service, what a joke! Well she must have had some sort of beef with us because the room we got was awful! Ugly, drab, old and equivalent to a crappy holiday inn, even then that may be an insult to the holiday inn. The bathroom had mold and hard water stains, and small.  The furniture was chipped and dis colored and carpet was old. Mind you we're not pretentious or picky but even this was pretty bad for vegas! We called to complain but the hotel refused to take responsibility and said they'd call back to switch our rooms and never did. When we met up at our friend's room I noticed their room was bigger and newer and a tad better but even they weren't happy with their room. Never again will we make the mistake of staying here. The Monte Carlo claim that \""""luxury should make you feel special no matter who you are\"""" and that was a bunch of BS. I should've just stuck with the Mandalay bay or Luxor.

We rolled into the driveway and decided to take advantage of the delivery option. I am all about the sesame chicken and the wife wanted to be hooked up with the honey walnut shrimp. They give you a large white rice with every entree which is a ton of rice. The sesame chicken and the honey walnut shrimp have been moved into our top 2 for delivery or take out Chinese food.

3174,"Going in I had high expectations for this place and was disappointed coming out. My friend had a Groupon and that's why we even wound up here. \n\nWe came in and was told it would be a 25 minute wait at 530 pm on a Thursday even though there were many spots open. We ended up just sitting at the sushi bar to avoid this \""""wait.\"""" \n\nWe ordered a few sushi rolls (808, chef yoshi, Da Fried Cali and the UFC), the 808 fries (delish), miso soup (really good), shrimp tempura (okay), and yellowtail jalape\u00f1o (lacking flavor). \n\nThe photos on Yelp make it look way more flavorful and delicious than it actually is. The sushi chefs were nice and friendly, the rest of the service sucked. Took forever to put in orders, water refills, get your tab, close your tab, etc. Saw one of the servers on her phone texting half the night, totally professional (sarcasm). \n\nTo sum it up, for the price you can go to a lot of other places in Vegas that will be worth it. If you have a Groupon, try it, cause only then is it worth the cost.",0
3175,"OMG just left this place for a brazillian wax from a girl named Olivia. 1st there was no where to park at all and I had to park across the street in the Jersey Mike parking lot. When I got in the receptionist was very nice nice and professional and said it would be about 15 min. I sat and I waited and she came out told her name and walked me to the room for the wax. I have had a wax about 2 times before with Nola Spa which was amazing but I thought since they had a good deal on amazon local I would give someone else a try. The wax room was similar to a gyno office room. All white, some what small and extremely bright. Almost like there would be a spot light on you if you laid there. I found that to be discomforting, but I asssumed since I was a new client there would be some type of conversation or repor built between the waxer (Olivia) and myself. She stated \""""please disrobe and lay down, I said is there a towel and she said no. Now being that I am used to going to Nola, where it a spa like atmosphere, zen music playing, and the waxer made me feel very comfortable. This was not the same at Nue. Over all I normally do not write reviews but for such a intimate appointment for a service, i would not want any one else to experience this. I have a hight tolererance and do not embaress easy so for me to say this is saying a lot. If its your first time or if you want to feel comfortable you may want to reconsider this spot for a brazillian or bikini wax. I would def recommend Nola Spa, google it.",0

My daughter didn't like the cheeseburger at all, and the steak looked... average... with no comment about it from my husband. My daughter thought we should have just gone to SmashBurger and I agreed that the French Dips at Arby's were better than what I had.

Then She went on saying she saw me put it in my shopping bag. I told her she could search me but she said,\""""I'm not gonna search you, but I know you took it.\"""" Then she wouldn't leave us be.

3180,"My husband and I hadn't gone there in many years - no idea why, but we always seem to end up in Arrowhead restaurant row,  fighting traffic and long waits (unless we're at Cheesecake Factory which always seems to have ample tables). It was our anniversary and we decided to try a different restaurant.\n\nWe were glad we went!  On a Friday night we only had to wait about 20 minutes, which we did at the bar - just enough time to have a drink.  The drink prices are really good and the bartender got our drink order as soon as we sat down, even though the entire bar was full (we got the last 2 seats).\n\nAbout 10 minutes after arriving, the hostess found us in the bar and asked us if we wanted a table (she could seat us then) or if we wanted to wait for a booth (we did) - instead of just dragging us to a table.  We should have requested a booth when we arrived, and forgot, so it was nice that they asked before we vacated our seats at the bar.\n\nThe food arrived in a timely manner and was terrific - great steak and lobster and, again, great prices.  We really like the fact that you can order your steak to size according to your hunger: no reason for over eating unless you want to.  The veges were cooked just right - not too crisp nor too limp. The portions were all good sized except for my baked potato.  It wasn't as large as other restaurants, but maybe that's why I had room for dessert (usually don't). \n\nFor dessert we got the sampler, figuring it would be 3 small portions. Wrong!  They were all full-size as far as I'm concerned.  We both looked at it and said, \""""how are we going to eat all this?\"""" (we did lol). My husband liked the carrot cake & cheesecake, and I loved the pecan fudge brownie with ice cream/whipped cream/hot fudge.\n\nLast but not least, our server was full of personality - we really liked her and tipped her accordingly...\n\nAll in all, a great night! We won't let so much time go by before visiting again.",1

3184,"Worst car rental and customer service  experience of my LIFE. \n\nWhen I rent a car a few weeks in advance of my trip, it better be there.

Meanwhile other rental car lines were moving along relatively speedily. But this wasn't what irritated me. \n\nNo, the reason I'm leaving a review is partially to pass the HOUR+ I've been waiting to receive the car that should have been ready for me at my designated pick-up time.

But how are there not cars available when my reservation was in the system (along with the dozens of irritated customers).

A place that serves tacos has a Latin night? It turns out there was a band who began laying in as we were leaving (which means we could have say in the dining room). The coctel was more like canned clams, canned crab, strangely halved shrimp in a ketchup sauce. The tacos were way overpriced, as was the beer. For the price of the carne asada, I expected some flavor and no gristle, but the most flavor I got from one was when I bit into the hidden lime. If you want some authentic Mexican food, get farther away from the strip and go somewhere that has actual recipes.",0

3193,"Flawless check-in: Front desk staff greeted me promptly, told me my room was ready and I was given vouchers for breakfast, welcome letters from the manager, and directions with a little map on how to navigate the grounds.  I had also forgotten my phone charger at home, so I got directions to the closest Verizon store (but not before the concierge checked to see if he had an extra charger in the stash of chargers people left behind in their hotel rooms).\n\nThe common courtyard/garden is spectacular- there are tables & chairs that surround one side, fire pits at night, adirondack chairs on the edges, all overlooking a showcase water fountain, grass, palm trees & flowers.  Great landscaping!  There are also little nooks between hotel & villa/cottage buildings- I stumbled across a giant lawn chess set as I was trying to get to the parking lot one day- very cool.  Room service rides around the property on big tricycles- very cool.  When I was here, there were lots of families and older folks- there was a golf tournament & Passover event so I'm guessing those are the drivers of the weekend demographics.\n\nHotel room was very standard and almost a disappointment if I didn't read it already in the other Yelp reviews.  I got a good deal too so I wasn't too bummed...just know that the rooms are a little dated and don't really match the Wright style of design that dominates the exterior and the common areas.  The A/C is also very loud- I ran it during the day while I wasn't in the room and turned it off at night so I could sleep in peace.  Bed is alright- mattress is a little too springy for me, has a cushy feather bed on top and a good amount of pillows- but Westin bed it ain't.  On my last night, there was a giant and bright full moon, which I enjoyed by opening my curtains and letting the moonlight shine into my room.  There are quite a few options in different price ranges- the cottages look fun and have patios where you can sit outside...I'm guessing those cost quite a bit more.\n\nHuge con- parking.  Valet costs $20+ a night, and Self Parking is $12...there's definitely not enough space for self parking so you're left to stalk guests who are leaving, or suck it up and park in the valet.  It's also quite a trek if you end up parking at the far end of the lot...I didn't mind since I could use the exercise, but if you have luggage or can't walk that far, be prepared to valet or be dropped off at the front entrance.  \n\nAnother con that I ended up being happy about- their spa was completely booked for Spa Week and they couldn't possibly fit in another treatment, even for a paying guest like myself.  It ended up OK, b/c I spent the day at another resort and spa, which i liked even better.  I took a stroll though the spa area- it was attached to the main pool area which was very loud, and didn't seem as lush or pleasant as the spa I ended up going to.  The pool areas get very full- try checking out the multiple pools they have on property to see which best fits your style.  Cheap thin small pool towels too- you'll need at least 2 to cover your chair.\n\nReally convenient- near Biltmore Fashion Park for shopping & restaurants, and not far from the highway and airport.  \n\nAll in all, it was a nice place to stay with beautiful ground and great service- I'll probably go check out another hotel the next time I'm in town, but if I find an incredible deal to the AZ Biltmore, I wouldn't hesitate to take advantage.",1

3195,"I've been to Carne Vino several times now. I don't know why, well, yes, I do, it's for the bread sticks. They're to die for. If you want to have a drink and don't mind paying more than almost anywhere else on Earth, then by all means stop in and enjoy. I rationalize that it's just the price of having those crack-like bread sticks.\n\nThat's really where my love for this place ends though. Just a word about price. Here's an example of how insane the prices are. I went in for lunch last week (and bread sticks) and the house special was $40 for  two drinks and a tuna sandwich. If you just wanted the tuna sandwich it was $19, and I believe the burger was $20. I'll admit that I've had $120 burgers in Europe, so it's not the most expensive, but for what you get (I sat for 30 minutes in an empty bar and the bartender never returned to take my order) it's just not worth it.\n\nFirst time in, we all had steaks. The quality of the meat was definitely far behind other steakhouses like the Palm over at Caesar's, SW Steakhouse, Delmonico's, Del Frisco's and the others we've tried here. Overly fatty and tough. It's always possible that you just go on a bad night, so I never write a place off because of one so-so experience.\n\nSo, we went again and my wife and I had the carpaccio (it was okay, just nothing to write home about) and I don't even remember the entrees. I just remember that both of us kept marveling throughout the meal at the prices vs. the quality, particularly in light of what you get for lower prices at the other restaurants in Vegas, even in the same hotel (Palazzo has equal and better food at Woo (now closed), Cut (amazingly good) and Table 10 to name just a few.\n\nSave yourself some money and visit one of those other places where you'll get better food for less money, or for about the same money (at Cut) just better food and service.",0
3196,"Had a great experience at this place. I went during lunch, had the chicken fajitas, and loved them. I definitely recommend this place at lunchtime, as it isn't too crowded and the prices are better. Also, our waitress was amazing! She waited on several tables and even heated up the tortillas. She also gave my family water to-go when she heard we were on a roadtrip. Loved it!",1
3197,"I am not going to say much, never paid so much for so little and my breakfast was tasteless to top it off \n\nOn the other hand, The service was nice! \n\nMontreal offer tons of better options to eat that offers much more in terms of taste and quality and $$$$$ \n\nI don't think I'm ever going back..  this place was great before the new owner, you knew what to expect (greasy deliciousness ) and huge portions. Now it's like they trying to hard to be something different but end up being a deception.",0
3198,"My server was adorable! He was so informative and had so much patience with me. He even told me his favorite in each category and why! I loved it. My chicken nortena torta was pretty good, but the carne asada quesadilla was awesome and even better as leftovers. It was too big too eat all at once. I also like how they served small, inexpensive ceviche tostadas, just to take the edge off while you wait for your entree! Very clean, sweet place! \nAlso, I have to say, go here before you go next door to spokes. That place is a joke  when it comes to their food.",1
3199,"Usually a BIG FAN, however tonight the Carne Asada Burro did not deliver; the culprit - poorly chopped Pico De Gallo.  Seriously pieces of onion larger than the biggest chunk of carne.  NO JOKE 1/4 inch cuts of onion, whole slices of Jalapeno, uncut cilantro leaves. :(",0
3200,Crazy show i was not sure what's to expect walking in threw the door all I seen was mascot suits and cocktail servers giving away free Jell-O shots upon entry that was nice going forward into the club was crazy there were mascots everywhere celebrity look a likes and midget Kanye west it was funny different  type of party but can only be a good time if you have a table no point in standing around there's no room for that it's a small venue and they only have two small bars. Fun industry party Wensday.,1
3201,"Ugh.  Just no.  Why?  It takes forever to get in.  It's complete anarchy trying to get in, even when your name is ON the list.  The music is boring and repeated often.  The drinks are small and expensive.  The crowd is, um, less than savory.  The floor is wet...all the time.  And a trip to the bathrooms requires a sherpa guide.  \n\nStick to the deli outside Pure.  The drinks and service are better and you get to hear the music from the Pussycat slots nearby.\n\nMy parting memory of Pure was walking outside alongside some Guidettes who had taken off their shoes and could barely stand.  One of them started ralphing on the sidewalk outside Ceaser's while the other girl held her hair.  Classy!",0
3202,"Be careful about booking the  \""""courtyard\"""". You might as well book at the Motel 8. Most of these rooms face the parking lot and the freeway. There were many other hotels with decent prices that I wish I would have booked. For the \""""MOTEL 8 \"""" ATMOSPHERE we could have a had our pick of other hotels for the same price with nicer rooms. Most Importantly if your looking for a bargain the hidden fees at this hotel bump up the price quite a bit making much nicer hotel in Vegas the same price. There is a 16.00 dollar A NIGHT HOTEL SERVICE FEE  that when added to the price of the room, could be applied to a better hotel in Vegas. Also, management did nothing about complaints. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Lastly, pictures of the rooms on the website our not at all what the really look like.",0
3203,"Awesome and can't wait to go back. Had spring rolls and soup as part of the food tour. Best Thai soup I have had! As I am a big fan of Bangkok Cafe in Tucson, and for me to say this is sacrilegious:) much better service than Bangkok though. The prices aren't bad either. They have local beer on tap too which is unheard of. You usually only get bottled beer at Thai restaurants. Will try to make it back to have a full meal for sure.",1
3204,"I've been a customer here for a number of years.  Always had good service until recently.  I went into the store to have batteries and service done on five watches.  While I was there I noticed they started carrying Glycine watches which I've had my eye on for a while.\n\nA young salesperson quoted me a price of $2,900.00 for one of the Airmen Multi-Time Zone watches that they were selling on consignment.   I knew it was a good price but needed to think on it.  When I got home my wife said she would buy it for me for Father's day so I turned right around the same afternoon (less than 30 minutes later) and when back to the store.\n\nWhen I returned, I was told by the salesperson that he misquoted the price and he had actually quoted me cost.  He then said it was $7,875 for the same watch.  I reminded him what he quoted me and offered a price of $3,500 which made him $600 profit and I would still feel like I got a good price.  I felt it was very reasonable of me to do that in light of the salesperson's mistake.  This way, he wins, I win.\n\nThe salesperson left and spoke with David Donaldson the owner and returned with a price of $6,300.  I told him that I drove all the way back specifically based on the $2,900 price I had originally been quoted.  David then came out and told me that the salesman was new (he isn't...he's been there for at least six months as he helped me the last time I had a battery replaced) and that he couldn't afford to sell the watch to me at that price and furthermore he was willing to lose a customer over his salesperson's mistake.  He said he couldn't afford to sell me the watch because he was a small business owner and it would cost him a month's rent.\n\n$3,500 minus $2,900 = $600 profit for a watch that he had less than a week.  Pretty good return in my book.  \n\nI'm in sales and have people work for me too.  When one of my guys quotes a price and it's wrong, I have to eat it.  I may not like it but it's the right thing to do.  It has cost me thousands of dollars before, but it's the right thing to do.  THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT. \n\nSo yes Dave you have lost a customer but in the world of online reviews and customer satisfaction, the way you treated me will cost you a lot more in missed business from people who read this review and won't like the way you do business.  It's called opportunity loss and your treatment of me will cost you a lot more than the missed excess profits you lost from being disrespectful and unreasonable with a good customer.  Remember, I offered you a price above cost to be fair and you still treated me poorly.  \n\nI then got a call from them the next day asking me to come pick up the watches I had left there for repair.  Really?  How childish and immature is that?  I gladly picked them up.\n\nI then found the exact Glycine watch and serial number listed for sale for $1,795 on www.chrono24.com by Feel Good Watches, Inc. a Scottsdale, AZ reseller. So the watches weren't even owned by Donaldson to sell, but rather were gray market watches that were put in his store on consignment.  I confirmed this with Feel Good Watches personally who indicated the watches were owned by a third party, most likely another jeweler.  David Donaldson was not only trying to gouge me in price, but he was selling gray market watches himself which I think is funny considering the owner's post below referencing other gray market watch resellers.   This just goes to show they are liars and dishonest.  The owner  makes reference in her response to not being able to sell below cost...the cost was $1,795 dollars which was the price the exact watch was available for sale on chrono24.com.  Secondly...I find it ironic they refer to cost when they in fact didn't even own the watches in the first place.\n\nThe owner has made a statement that the watches were properly marked and price.  This is a lie. There was no price tag on the watch.  I know that because the tag on the watch has a number of 3883 on it which I asked if this was the original price and I was told it was the watch model and serial numbers.  The salesperson then quoted me a price of $2,900 and told me what a great price that was.   The salesperson knowingly quoted me the price and even though he had been there 90 days, I would hardly say he was new.    The salesperson  didn't hesitate at all in quoting me the original price of $2,900.  There was no miscommunication on my part.\n\nBOTTOM LINE.  AS BUSINESS OWNERS YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THE LIES YOU CONTINUE TO CREATE.  YOU SHOULD JUST COME CLEAN.  DO NOT BUY A WATCH FROM THIS BUSINESS AS NOT ONLY IS DAVID DONALDSON DISHONEST, BUT SO IS HIS WIFE.  I guess the whole mix up was a blessing in disguise as I would have way overpaid for the watch and I could have gotten it for half what I had offered him in good faith.  Buyer beware.  I'm going to stick with a different brand now and I'll never set foot in this poor business again.  Neither should you.\n\nCONSUMERS BEWARE!",0
3205,"Tried this place out today and omg it's so yummy that I had to write a review!!! I ordered the chicken gyro combo that came with fries and a drink for $8.50 after tax. I asked the owner what a certain dessert was that was sitting in the pan on the counter and he gave me a piece for free! Very friendly workers. Now back to the food...let's just say, I got it to go and when I got home I was barely able to eat it because my family devoured it!!! I took one bite and was moaning because it was so delicious, and my sisters and parents came into the kitchen to check out what I was eating and asked to try it... Then they just kept taking more and more of my food cause it was sooo good! Now they owe me. Lol so the fries are seasoned to perfection, the chicken is marinated and juicy topped with fresh tomatoes, onions, lettuce and tahini sauce on a pita....nom nom I'm getting hungry just talking about it!!!",1

3215,"My 100th review deserves to be a 5 star one! Congrats DuPars! I've been hearing about this place for a while now. Old cafe style in a run down casino?! I'm there! Not to mention the claim of the \""""worlds best pancakes\"""" was a bit intriguing. My daughter, boyfriend and myself were heading downtown not sure exactly of our destination and I remembered this place. If you valet park at the golden gate, it's a simple walk thru the small casino. Otherwise park anywhere allowed downtown and find your way. The waitresses and decor somewhat reminded me of a Waffle House. So right of the bat I was happy. The breakfast and lunch menu had TONS of comfort food classics. Never in my life did I think I'd order a meatloaf sandwich, but I did and was so happy about it. The kid had French toast with blueberries and the boyfriend went with a chicken pot pie. And then of course as a table we ordered a nice stack of pancakes. The super sweet waitress actually stopped and asked if we were serious when ordering all this food. (Did I mention I also had a $3 shrimp cocktail?) Well be proud miss waitress cuz we killed it ALL. The pot pie needed a little salt n pepper, but THAT'S IT! That's my only complaint. Great food. Genuine service. Exactly how I would expect an old school, cafe, Waffle House, waitress in cute outfits- type of dive should be! Well done.",1

3217,"The Stratosphere seems to get more and more ghetto as the years go on. \nI'm guessing the reason it has trouble keeping up with the times is because it's surrounded by the grit and sleaze of the Naked City, and it's just so far away from everything. \nThe mall is laughable. There's a pretzel place in there which I grabbed a pretzel from in my Journey to Nowhere, and the pretzel kind of saved my life, but the whole Journey to Nowhere is a completely different story. The mall of the Stratosphere is a strange mashup of Beijing and Paris, it fails on both counts, and all of the stores sell overpriced, tourist trap junk. \nYou know what else is laughable? The showroom. If you walk past it when a show is going on, you can hear EVERYTHING. There's also a translucent window behind the the theater bar, so if you sit there and look closely, you can see whatever show is playing for free. Both of their shows (American Superstars and Bite) look like crap so it's probably better to try and see it for free anyway rather than waste your money. \n\nSuggestions: Close down the buffet since it seems to have lost all hope and buy up the surroundings so the neighborhood will be more aesthetically appealing. I'm shocked the Stratosphere hasn't been closed, the only thing it really has going for it are the rides, restaurant and observation deck on top of the tower.",0
3218,"Great food, horrible customer service!  I purchased a Groupon in June and went there with my husband.  The food was excellent and the waiter was extremely nice and accommodating.  Consequently, I returned and later bought another groupon when they came out in July.  However, the next trip was a complete 180.  I spent about $70 on food and drink for my daughter and myself.  When ready to leave, I presented the Groupon to our waiter (different waiter, older, some sort of accent).  Evidently he pushed the \""""redeem\"""" button because he handed the phone back to me with the message, \"""" Are you certain you want to redeem this Groupon.\""""  And, told me there was something wrong with my phone.  I explained it was just prompting us to redeem the Groupon.  He seemed confused, so, I pressed, \""""Yes.\""""  Unfortunately, he had apparently not written the code down.  Consequently, he told me I could not use the Groupon and accused me, in front of all the other customers, of trying to rip him off by using an expired Groupon.  I was livid because no matter how I or my daughter tried to explain it to him, he would not listen.  I asked to speak with the manager.  However, he told me he was the owner.  At that point, we left and I informed him I would never return.  After we got home, my daughter, still very upset, called to speak with him.  He continued to refuse to listen and offered no solution.  All of this nonsense over a Groupon that would have cost the business $10, since they had already received the $10 I spent on it.  \n\nAs it turned out, he was not the owner.  The owner called my daughter the next day and apologized, stating that she would make it right.  She suggested I stop payment on the transaction.  However, I was told by the bank that debit transactions cannot be stopped.  I relayed this message to the owner, but have never received a response.  So,  I can only assume that she has no intention of making it right, either   I can't believe any concerned business owner would let an employee  treat customers that way and not make it right.

I couldn't have been happier. \n\nThe layout of the shop is very spacious, it's air-conditioned and very clean. You have ample space to walk around and do your shopping. They carry all the basic asian food stuff. They are priced very competitively with other asian marts, and have their own specialty to bring to the table.  \n\nI found my favorite soy beancurd there. They call it sweet tofu. I simply love those and would never pass them up on every trip to chicago chinatown. This is the first time I've seen it being sold here in Madison *so exciting* I was also looking forward to the sashimi that they say they carry over the weekends, but have no luck as of now. Their bakery items are also a great find. They carry delicious awesomeness from chicago and other regions. For fans of Japanese kit-kats, they carry the macha kit kats and two other flavors directly from Japan! They also have a variety of snacks from the asian region as well. \n\nI would make it my regular go-to place for groceries. The fact that it's a stone's throw away from saigon noodles seals the deal.

The portions are filling and the people that work there are kind and upbeat. This place has a nice vibe to it and certainly deserves a visit if you're in the area for lunch.,1
3230,"I would NOT recommend Oregano's!  There are much better options in town.  \n\nOn a Sunday night, I went there trying to get a casual bite to eat.  The server told me the wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Are you kidding?  \n\nThen they had me sit at the bar table.  The waiter then kicked me out of the table.  Apparently, those tables were reserved.  He instructed me to sit at an empty bar stool.  It seems they were also reserved.  Rather than saying so, an angry mother PUSHED me out of the way.  Is that necessary?  A simple statement that there was a miscommunication would have sufficed.  \n\nI really resent being kicked out of the table and being pushed.  The hostess had no other alternative than to drink in another section.  Would I really want to spend any money in this establishment after such an experience?  I will never go back to any Oregano's.   \n\nA much better option in Old Town is the Daily Dose, just one block away.  The servers are very nice, the food is tasty, there was no wait and there were GREAT happy hour specials.  Check out the Daily Dose.  It saved my evening.",0
3231,"Pros: It's an airport, people need to use them\nCons: Everything else\nI changed planes in Terminal 3 and was surprised by how dirty the entire area was. There were little pieces of paper and bits of food on every square foot of the carpeting. The restroom looked like it had cooties. There was an attendant  \""""cleaning\"""", she did not wipe the standing water off the sinks and the floors appeared to never have been mopped.  Three of the six water faucets did not work.\nAm not sure what the attendant was doing, maybe just pushing the trash can around. Other attendants in the main areas were clustered around talking. Yea, I know it is dirty work, but the alternative is the filthy airport they run there.  \nAn employee told me \""""it's all about the slot machines\"""". So if you want to play slots on a layover in a dirty environment, go for it. I will be using another aiport for layovers in the future.",0
3232,"Sassy Glasses has one thing going for it; frame selection. \n\nIf there is another place in Phoenix that has comparable frame selection I am unaware of it. \n\nSassy Glasses falls short everywhere else however. The problem is Sassy Glasses is just a middle man. They do not make their own lenses, nor do they have their own doctors. And their optometry knowledge is, to say the least, limited. \n\nThey are good at helping you find the right style, but the doctors they send you to are sub par and if there is a problem with your lenses you will not be able to deal directly with the lens makers. \n\nThe bottom line is Sassy Glasses is good for people with minor vision issues who want to look \""""hip\"""" in their glasses, but people who need serious optometry services should look elsewhere.",0

Had a lot of questions and the Doctor was very helpful. Thorough and informative. Nurses followed up sooner than expected on the results. Place is a little tricky to find.

All good.",1
3235,"We have an issue with All Stars Sports Bar. Make that two.\n\nFirstly, just because you are one of the few liquor licensees within the airport, it doesn't give you permission to stock only the cruddiest of beers... Coors, Bud Light and Sam Adams. Oh please.\n\nSecondly, the Wendy's fast food next door serves equal or better food than All Stars, for half the price and twice the efficiency.\n\n\nSo here's how I came to the above two conclusions...\n\nSunday early evening at PHX. It has been a long week in AZ, and I desperately wanted a beer and dinner before getting on the plane.\n\nJust like when you're at any sports venue, I do expect to pay through the nose for that beer at the airport. But given my recent experiences, that beer does NOT have to be a cruddy mass commercial brand. \n\nTake note PHX - tiny little PDX serves local micro brew brands right at the gate. So does SFO. That is supporting local businesses and leaving your visitors with a wonderful last impression.\n\nNext, the food. My expectations were low. I'm totally cool with burgers, hot dogs and fries. But when the burger patty came out, it honestly looked like a fast food burger vs. something I'm paying $15 for. That didn't bode well given there were plenty of fast food options I could have gone with.\n\nThe server was nice enough but not very efficient. She was holding my plastic silverware (oh yes, everything is served on plastic) WHILE talking to another customer. I was puzzled.\n\nBottom line: DON'T EAT HERE. Grab a to-go from the fast food or sandwich places. If you must have a beer, then go ahead... it's more about the experience of chatting with fellow travelers vs. getting an interesting beer.",0
3236,"Nice Atmosphere, enjoyed the addition of architectural surroundings with the restaurant. As for location, its located within the Rampart Casinos so there would be a long walk through casino slot machines and other restaurants to arrive at the destination. \n\nEnjoyed the appetizer of 'sweet water shrimp', which was very tasty that was wrapped in prosciutto. yummy:) Entrees were alright, like a typical Italian restaurant, and likewise the service.",1

3238,This was my first time here and I have to say I was unimpressed. That is just my opinion. I am sure most will call me crazy and it is not that I didn't like the sandwich I just thought it was ok. I have had better.\n\nNow to clarify I am not a fan of the major sub chain. I don't go their Way at all. I am the Duke at my favorite sub shop. Now some people may not like that place and that is fine. That's what makes the world go around. If we all had the exact same opinion on everything life would be boring. But so far everyone I have taken there likes it. Even one person who had been to Jersey Mike's before liked it more.\n\nI got the Original Italian on white bread regular size. I thought the bread was dry. The whole sandwich was dry to me but I like extra condiments on my sandwich. The meat was good and I like the fact that they slice it right in front of you but overall I was just not impressed.\n\nI will not be disappointed if I never go back to Jersey Mike's again. Not because I hated it just because in my opinion there are must better places out there. I was even excited to try it because a lot of people talk about it. Maybe I just went on a bad day. But I tried it was not impressed enough to even give it maybe one more shot. I will stick with my favorite sub place. Maybe sometime in the future someone can talk me into trying Jersey Mike's again.,0
3239,"All these positive reviews don't lie. Great place for tires! No appointment needed and I got the sense that this is the type of place that would prefer if you just showed up.

Didn't try to up sell me but gave me exactly what I needed. Will definitely be back! Thanks for such a great tire-getting experience.",1
3240,"Considering my penchant for neon lighting, basement bars and anything Spanish/Latin American/Central American themed, this should be the kind of place that I would run to of a weekend for crazy dance times and rum imbibing. But unfortunately, my heart lies with another Mexican themed establishment on Hanover St, which is far superior, and I just can't forget that when I'm in here.\n\nI do have a tendency to judge places to go dancing more harshly than other types of businesses. But a good quality dancing and drinking arena is very important, and pretty hard to come by sometimes. Something about the vibe of El Barrio doesn't quite sit with me. It's always busy, which is to be expected, seeing as it's a free entry club in the centre of town. The tunes are decent enough, the last time I was in on a Saturday they played a pretty good range of hits of a cheesey nature. They have a wee restaurant bit where you can get food until pretty late in the morning, and a substantial dance floor plus a few tables scattered about. \n\nEvery time I'm in here I just feel a bit hesitant about getting properly stuck into the dance floor, as I'm just not rating the banter yet. Maybe these things take time, and considering my friends seem to be obsessed with coming here at the moment, I might just have to start feeling the love.",0
3241,"We did some snooping online for buffet after the Monte Carlo dropped the ball on us and made me very hesitant on trying another buffet on my birthday trip but OH MY MY! I just loved the food in here. \n\nThe line to get in was only about 3 parties deep but it took us about 25 minutes to be seated which was really annoying. WTF? How hard is it to just tell people to sit and take their drink orders UGH...Nobody acknowledged our wait for the longest time with an apology or an \""""I'm sorry for the wait\"""". Not cool or very professional for something inside a nice hotel like the Bellagio. I was expecting stellar service walking in and I don't think that was a very nice first impression of the place.\n\nThis place was very pricey but we got in line about 30 minutes prior to the dinner but paid the lunch price for the place. \n\nSome of the dishes that were available were: crab legs with butter, prime rib, mashed potatoes and gravy, tortellini, 4 different types of pizzas to choose from, some kobe beef, seared salmon. The array of desserts were some of my favorites. Little cappuccino pudding cups, coffee tiramisu, macaroons, creme brulee, flan....excuse me I'm starting to drool all over again. \n\nThe place is pricey and I would have liked much more attentive service. I noticed the waiters were clearing a lot of tables thinking the customers were done only to have the patrons return to their table cleared and their drinks nowhere to be found. I also think the lighting had a really ugly yellow glow. It seemed kind of dim and boring.",1
3242,"Poor Customer Service! I visit this location fairly often but tonight was the worst! Marvin, the manager took my order, and got it wrong. When I explained to him it wasn't what I ordered nor was it what he repeated back he basically shrugged his shoulders and said oh well.

3243,"I usually love love love this place, but my experience last week was underwhelming. We visited on Friday night and made a reservation for 9:30 through opentable.com, even though we probably didn't need one, as the restaurant was emptying out. \n\nWe usually order a range of the small plates and sushi. Friday was no different. I ordered the TNT roll, tuna tartare, and the rock shrimp tacos. \n\nAfter a long wait, the tuna tartare was served first. It was tasty, but needed some salt. Also, it didn't taste particularly fresh. It should have been served colder. \n\nThe TNT roll was good, but it was not particularly special. \n\nThe shrimp tacos came last. The tiny shrimp were ice cold. We sent them back, even though we never send food back. They served us a fresh set of tacos and they were fine. Nothing special. \n\nTamari has been one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh. The first floor looks shabby. It could use a paint touch up or some deep cleaning. \n\nOur service was off. At times we couldn't find our waiter. \n\nThe weirdest thing was that manager/owner (big man in a big suit) was running around checking on the kitchen and talking to workers, as he has done each time I have visited Tamari. As the kitchen is open to the diners, it stuck me as odd that the big man in the big suit has never ever approached one diner to ask about their experience any time that I have visited.",0
3244,"Stayed for 3 nights on business in early June.  Had a really nice experience.  It was a pricy, which is no big deal if the company pays for everything.  I'm not sure I could afford to stay otherwise.  My room was just beautiful.  The bed was huge and comfy.  The bathroom was spacious and lovely.  I had a great view from my room through the gigantic wall of windows.    \nJavier's restaurant  was delicious and not crazy expensive (everything in Vegas is pretty expensive).  I expected the trip to be exhausting, but was able to relax and enjoy myself.  \nThe only problem was a very very long line for check in which took over 30 min,  and long lines for all of the places that served any breakfast foods in the morning (as in Woah HUGE lines).  Otherwise it is a sleek, gorgeous place, easy to navigate, and a great stay.",1
3245,"A luxurious but relaxed bar atmosphere; excellent bar food; stellar service.  I don't know what more I could ask for in a place like this! \n\nThere is the bar/lounge section of the restaurant and also a dining section (separate from the bar and gaming, it's on the smaller side with some large, comfortable booths and tables).  Both are well-ventilated and surprisingly don't wreak of smoke, unlike some of the other gaming bar/restaurants in town.  \n\nService was top notch.  Our server was so friendly.  You could tell that she needed to be in both the bar and dining room but she did a fantastic job of keeping drinks full and being there to check in on us at all the right times.  \n\nThe food came out SO quickly and was just the ultimate of bar food!  Even the most basic things like the mozzarella bites as an appetizer were simply delicious!  Hubby had meatloaf sliders and I had burger sliders and they were both incredible.

3246,"I was visiting my parents on the northwest side of town and we decided to try Sassy Sal's for dinner.  My first thought when looking at the menu was that the items were reasonably priced - 5.99 for most of the sandwiches.  My mother and I each got the pulled pork and my dad decided to get a combo with 1/3 rack of ribs and one side for 9.99.\n\nWell when we got the food home I was in for a bit of a disappointment.  The menu says of the pulled pork:  \""""Slowly smoked seasoned pork topped with creamy coleslaw.\""""  Fair enough, I'm used to good sized pulled pork sandwiches with a heaping amount of coleslaw.  There was a very moderate portion of pork but the real bummer was that the coleslaw was not on the sandwich, but a minuscule portion on the side in a one ounce cup- filled half way- even trying to spread it thin I couldn't get it to reach to the end of the bun.  The pork itself didn't have much flavor, I was desperately wishing for some sort of sauce to put on to give it some taste, but of course a side of sauce is sixty cents extra.\n\nMy dad said the ribs were good but they were also pretty meager and his side of mac and cheese was of similar proportion. \n\nWe did get a side of fries which were very good, other than that the place was a big let down.",0

When I greeted the truck I found out that they had managed to smash the dryer up so it would need to be changed, but the washer was ok (although neither washer or dryer were in boxes to suggest they were new and now off the shop floor).

Maybe he missed the fact that a friend of mine ahead of me handed me a water bottle as they were paying for their order. Not sure what his deal was, but my business is better spent elsewhere. Took them about an hour to make the pizzas, too- way too long for anyone impatiently waiting to get their grub on. I'm sure they'll make their money off of other customers coming back from clubs drunk.\n\nPS The pizza's mediocre, but insobriety makes everything better, doesn't it? Not worth the buck.",0
3267,"The two star here is all for food. Me and my husband went for dinner last night. Not our first time. We go there often for some good prime rib, classy service and quite time. However, we had a horrible experience this time. Real BAD SERVICE!! Our server was Adam. He introduced himself as Adam, although his name tag had Amir written on it. He was completely untrained or new or just didn't want to be there. We could tell because we've been there so many times before. It was just all wrong from start to finish. He didn't know his beers. Forgot to bring his spatulas for the spinning salad bowl. It was actually funny,, he spun the bowl, realized he had forgotten his equipments and excused himself to get them leaving the bowl spinning. Funny. We figured, it happens, no big deal. But it started getting to me when he didn't even bother to check up on us. Not once. We had to get someone else to get us some more ojus ( beef broth). Now, my husband and I both being from the hospitality industry, we understand sometimes it's just tough to get to the table when you're slammed and busy. THIS DUDE HAD ONE TABLE HE WAS WAITING ON. US! It was a slow tuesday night for heaven's sake. He walked pass us like at least 3 times yet never once check up if everything was okay and if we needed something. He totally didn't mention anything about the horseradish sauces which we noticed sitting in the corner after we had stopped eating. I wish he had  as I absolutely would have loved some.  He finally showed up after we were done and had stopped eating. He offered dessert, we said no. And then he just started clearing my plate. HELLO? WE GOT BIG CHUNKS OF PRIME RIB LEFT ON OUR PLATE? MAYBE WE WANT TO BRING IT HOME? I had to stop him and ask him to wrap them go. \nLike I said,, worst service ever. It seemed like he just didn't want to be there or he was new and nervous! I don't know! But it was bad!! Definitely not Lawry's standard. And it was our anniversary!!! I wanted to talk to the manager just so they know what's going on but We didn't want to ruin his night. He had already ruined ours!!! But then again i figured Lawry's need to know this so i decided to yelp. \nTHANK GOD THE FOOD WAS AMAZING AS ALWAYS!!!",0

3274,"I've been traveling to Vegas for work for over 7 years, and always looked forward to eating here. Unfortunately things have changed. The last 2 times I've been, it has been horrible. I found out that they have been sold. I thought I would give it another chance, that perhaps the lst visit after the sale was a fluke, but it was the worst ever experience.\nI waited at my table forever for a waiter. I got up twice to ask for one. When she arrived, she was very indifferent. She asked if I knew what I wanted. I had to ask HER for a menu. I ordered a glass of white wine. When she finally brought it. it was the smallest pour I have ever seen. Had to request bread, and was told they were 'out of butter'.\nDinner took it's time, and was delivered by someone else, but it was acceptable. \nMy waitress never came back to see if I needed another drink, or to check on the food. \nOf course, I had to search again for someone to bring a bill. When I got it, I was charged double for the small drink. Also had to wait to get an itemized receipt that my company requires. \nThe table next to me complained to the waiter that they were never brought a side dish they had ordered.  I overheard the table on the other side of me complain that one dish was cold. \n\n Obviously M&S, you are unaware that there are thousands of other restaurant choices in Las Vegas. I will not",0
3275,"It's our 4th yr anniversary and I persuaded my hubby to watch a Filipino movie which is only shown in summerlin theater, far from where we live.

I read the reviews about pan asian and got convinced to try it and with the $20 for $10 deal it sounds really good. \n\nWe got there and greeted by the owner, very pleasing and smiling all the time, felt very welcomed. It's fish Friday so I ordered mostly seafood. Menu prices are all less than $10 but when the food arrived they look so fancy and elegant. I was really impressed and the taste is very good, not your typical Asian cooking where it taste good coz of MSG... this one, their food taste good because it's fresh and true flavors of the ingredients. My hubby who is not a foodie like me was very impressed too and could not stop eating and after each bite he literally say \""""this is so good\"""" in each bite he takes. \n\nEven if this is far from our house, we would definitely go back here and buy more of the coupon deal. Calamari is very good, crunchy breading that is just the right amount of coating. Pad Thai is amazing, not the usual yellowish flat noodles in other thai resto, but the flavors are so good together I can eat the noodles by itself even without the meat which means even if I order chicken or shrimp pad Thai I'm sure it will still be very good. Red snapper was very tasty and the sauce super good. \n\nOwners are very friendly and inviting, I felt like I was eating at home with Asian family;0)",1
3276,Second visit was with Owen. I'm not sure if bc my first blow out was free it was different but Owen is a-mazing.  I got an aromatherapy head massage at the shampoo bowl which was so relaxing.

3278,"We visited on a Saturday evening. We had 4 adults and 4 children. The space is clean and well designed and interesting looking. \n\nWe ordered 2 beef sandwiches, several hot dogs, the meatball sub, a children's cheeseburger, and a side salad. The salad was fresh and Italian dressing was tasty. The hot dogs were definitely Chicago dogs although they weren't hot when we got them. The fries all came out hot and were good. \n\nThe beef sandwiches were quite dissapointing. The beef was visually unappealing- grey and limp looking. Quite frankly it was lacking any flavor, it mostly tasted old and microwaved. The \""""gravy\"""" was not flavorful either, it looked like it was going to taste good and homemade and was quite the opposite. My daughter said she wouldn't order the cheeseburger again. My son enjoyed the meatball sub and would order it again. \n\nOverall the hotdogs and fries would be worth visiting again to get a Chicago dog fix and seeing if the come out hot next time. The service and cleanliness warrant another visit but I won't give more than 2 stars because if the food.",0

Parking is a mess, there's a shady lot across the street that is also open for guests. \n\nWe got a double room, went up, it smelled like mildew and the carpet was wet in spots. Seriously? Tile around toilet was multi-colored, not in the good way. It looked like pee stain around the base of the toilet, but it was the messed up tile color. Hole/crack in the sink, way ghetto. We complained, they \""""upgraded\"""" us to the 15th floor, same room, and gave us some drink coupons for the pool. Tiny beds, halfway between twin and full. Two small Asians in the bed was uncomfortable. Tub/shower clogged and took forever to drain. Cheap tv, no flat screen. But the carpet was better.\n\nFirst time going out we were going down the elevator and this two white trash guys get in with us holding a blunt. Reeked of weed, they start harassing my friend who's on the phone with her family. I tell them to back off and chill and all I remember was them yelling \""""Merica.\"""" Really? Nice clientele. As we were walking out of the casino behind them, one of these classy gentlemen mooned us bare ass and all. Nice. \n\nThe only saving grace about this place was the pool. Surprisingly nice, and the free drink we got helped. Get the rum frozen drink. Nice and strong.

3280,Started off with waiting farrr to long to be able to order a drink. Finally got the drink and I swear it had not a drop of alcohol in it. Actually had to buy shots to put in the drink.

There are a couple big comfy chairs with a place to read, a pool table and a couple of arcade games to play while waiting for your food. After reading a few reviews on line it turns out that the restaurant used to be a coffee shop that must have left most of the interior behind when they went out of business. \n\nI had the beef ribs, plain chicken wings, mac and cheese and what was suppose to be baked beans. My daughter had a beef rib and corn on the cob and my wife had a pulled pork sandwich with corn on the cob. \n\nMy ribs were tough. The sauce was horrible! My mac and cheese had the consistency of baby food. WWWWAAAAYYYY over cooked. And the so called bake beans weren't even baked beans weren't even baked beans. They were pinto beans in some type of baked bean sauce. The only thing halfway decent was my wings which were small and cold from sitting out for hours. \n\nMy wife said her food was so so.

The place is super small and the floors are so sticky you can't even walk right. It also smelled like farts and poop. The DJ sucked; it took him way too long to transition to the next song.

Not sure why that didn't work out, but when he left Four Peaks he decided to open up his own brewery; and thus began SanTan Brewery. You can find him sitting at the bar, conversing with his customers and getting a good idea of what they want from the bar/restaurant. \n\nThe food is really good at Santan, and each meal can be paired with a brew. I am a big fan of the Santanwich and the Raspberry Stuffed Mushrooms.",1

I've always been able to find everything that I need here....now I'm not sure if it's always the lowest prices, but its comparable to other places. Now that Target is offering a lot more food options, I find myself grocery shopping for certain items because it is cheaper than the supermarket, etc. They have cute kids clothes too! I've always liked buying things for my friend's baby showers or kid's birthday parties since they have a variety of toys, clothes and electronics. One stop shop at Tar-Jay!

3311,"From a lack of organization and communication to charging for alcohol on an international cross-Atlantic flight, Air Canada's service was a disappointment every step of the way. \n\nIn Rome, we waited in line for an hour only to be stopped at the front for literally 100s of passengers to move in front of us for an earlier flight. I understand the need, but the lack of signage and communication meant we felt incredibly mistreated. I imagined at least five solutions to improve their set-up while we stood and watched people pass us. \n\nOnce onboard we found a standard US style card in the seat back pocket describing the snacks and drinks we could buy. On an international flight of 9+ hours? Though they never communicated what would happen, we were served meager food, but alcohol was a premium $6.50. \n\nWe'd flown to Italy on another Star Alliance airline, Lufthansa. They were fantastic in every way. Clear communication about services. Food and drink freely available between served meals. Free alcohol. \n\nI'll grant you, our flight was safe and relatively on time, but the experience is not one I'll repeat. I always say when flying international, use airlines outside the US. Except Air Canada. Their service is worse than ours!",0
3312,"The inside is really nice with the views of the fountains. But I only give it 2 stars because the music was really crap. Some of the songs were played several times in the same hour or so we were there! I could play better songs on my iPod, and I'm no DJ! We got in for cheaper as we were staying at the bellagio, and as chicks we got 2 free drinks with a choice of vodka or champagne... Which was warm! The dance floor is very small due to the sectioned off areas at both ends of the d floor. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.... XS nightclub however was awesome!",0
3313,"I booked a package deal and selected Luxor since it was one of the lowest priced deals. Since i had never stayed there,  I thought I'd give it a try.  Check in was fairly easy. They don't seem so friendly with the guests but that part was alright. My non-smoking room on the 19th floor smelled like a mild cigar. The bathroom and beds seemed really clean.  I actually only have two things that were deal breakers for me: \n\n1) it's a bit too far from the middle of the strip so it isn't the most convenient if you like to go down to the Miracle Mall shops and Bellagio/Ceasar's Palace. Very limited places to eat (with any decent reviews) without having a walk a ways,  \n\n2) The air conditioner had a problem during the day keeping it cool in the room due to the glass windows. It seemed the room was probably about 80 degrees inside. I must say it was 100 degrees outside but I need a more comfortable room when it comes to AC.  The room seemed to get somewhat comfortable around 3am.\n\nThey do have the Titanic exhibit at the Luxor.  I don't plan to go back to the Luxor.",0
3314,"I truly love Indian food and I wanted to like this place more, but I ultimately couldn't. I wound up at the lunch buffet and didn't think too much of it. The dishes at the buffet really lacked the oomph that I am so used to at Indian restaurants, and unless the pot was personally stirred, some of the dishes were room temperature. As far as pricing, it wasn't too bad; it was just around $10. \n\nAfter reading other reviews (Mainly Lisa O's) I would consider trying this place after the buffet is put away. But until then, I'll probably just be staying away.",0
3315,"This place was alright. We came here on a Saturday afternoon. It was semi-full but there was a lot of people waiting on to-go orders. I pictured this place more bar and less restaurant. It was the opposite. \nthey had several TV's and my pet-peeve. NO VOLUME why even have a tv in the 1st place? \nOMG if you've read my reviews you know that is a deal killer for me. and I'll end up somewhere else. \nWe ordered wings and 2 salads. This must have annoyed this waitress b/c we never saw her again? she spent the ENTIRE time kissing the next table's ass..and I mean giggling like a teenager at everything this table's patrons had to say, and would by pass us like nothing. \nmy bf finally said I guess my empty glass is invisible?  I figured it must have been. When we finally did get her attn and flagged her down to get the check - her whole tone changed. I guess the high pitched giggly tone and helpful attitude was reserved only for certain tables and ours wasnt up. Maybe we didnt spend enough? \nsorry but I'm only going to order what I'm willing to actually eat. \n\nWINGS: The wings were ok. we ordered HOT and garlic cilantro. The garlic cilantro had ZERO flavor. I was really disappointed b/c I like both A LOT. garlic is up there w/ salt & pepper in my household. The hot good though, but they were very very very VERY greasy. I think i used every napkin in the place. more napkins than BWW or HOOters cant be good in the calorie dept. and the taste wasnt that far above and beyond so IMHO the nxt time I go I'll probably try something else, and maybe get it to go to avoid bad waitressing.",0

The side dishes are also much larger portions at S&W. It's enough for two people to share compared to Flemings. And the Truffled Mac & Cheese is to die for. If you have the option of choosing, its hands down Smith & Wollenskys. Trust me!",1
3321,"Dear Gordon f*cking Ramsay, Esq.\n\nDude, you need to chill.  You have like 275 shows on TV, most of which consist of you screaming your balls off at some poor sap because \""""the soup was dry\"""".  I only ever watch Master Chef, and that's because you dispense earnest, humanizing advice that gives the impression that somewhere deep inside, you still kind of give a sh*t, which your image desperately needs.  But seriously, Master Chef Junior?  What's next?  Master Chef 'n Da Hood?  Master Chef in Space?\n\nAnd no, I'm not brainstorming for you.\n\nAnyway, the point is, we get it, you're a \""""brand\"""", but we are so bombarded with your visage that it almost makes it seem like your place as culinary alpha-and-omega is maybe not arbitrary (no one can deny you are an accomplished chef) but seemingly self-appointed.  So, because of this, I went to BurGR (the only one of your Vegas restaurants I can consistently afford) with the firm predisposition to hate it.\n\nAnd based on the decor alone, at the beginning I totally did.  Your face is all over the damn place, your hostesses looked plucked out of a Hooters calendar, and the flames-and-metal decor is over-the-top and uninviting.  But, I have to say, once I sat my ass down and started stuffing my face, my mind changed quickly.  Been three times already, and it wasn't some kind of fluke.  The garden burger with the duck bacon and fried egg is as good a burger as I've ever had.  Definitely top three.  The fries with the fancy ketchup are absolutely delicious and the service was quick, effective and infallibly polite.\n\nI also have to give you kudos for keeping prices reasonable, at least comparatively speaking for a Vegas strip restaurant.  Fries are not included with the burgers but one order can easily feed two people, which is nice to know in advance.  You have an awesome beer selection and I was pleasantly surprised to see that for $6, I get a tall pilsner glass filled to the top.  The Innis & Gunn is a particularly awesome pairing with any of the burgers.\n\nAnyway, I still find you kind of odious, but food-wise, BurGR is firing on all cylinders, and ultimately that's what's important.\n\nThe water was a bit raw, though.",0
3322,"It was late and we had barely eaten all day.  After buying the giant, FOOTBALL of booze, we decided that we wanted a proper greasy spoon breakfast.  We ended up in line at this establishment.\n\nThe wait took a while.  It turns out that there was no host/hostess, so a waitress was doing double duty.  She was hustling too.  When we got seated, we had to wait a bit for some service.  As it turns out, the whole seating chart and which waiter was taking which tables was a total clusterf*ck.  The hostess/waitress ended up taking our order eventually.\n\nWe each ordered the same thing: scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and sourdough toast.  All the food turned out as expected minus the bacon.  It was dropped in a deep fat fryer and incenerated to the point where it was chalk-like.  Not edible at all.  But the rest of the meal was decent.\n\nThe bussers were slow and dimwits.  If someone tells you to bring 2 glasses of water of to our table, don't worry about putting them on a tray and gingerly walking them over.  Use your hands, pal!

3325,"We were wandering Fremont Street with some out of town guests and decided on Firefly at the Plaza, only to find out it was closed. Yelp helped is find this alternative.\n\nThere are 2 distinct parts to this restaurant, the teppanyaki side and the restaurant side.  They really should warn you that if you want teppanyaki, you need to sit at the bar area.  And if you want to be able to hear the person next to you, you should sit as far away from the teppanyaki bar as you possibly can.  While I can appreciate coming and having a great time, the group at the teppanyaki bar was so loud and obnoxious, we couldn't even carry on a conversation with one another.\n\nThe food was okay, but for someone who has never been to china and is looking to try something new, the wait staff could not describe the food or how it was prepared (as bad as it sounds, it may have just been a language barrier. The wait staff was authentic and Asian, but we had some difficulty understanding what they were saying).  I ordered the Hong Kong Chow Mein.  In my personal taste, if this is what food tastes like in China, I don't ever want to go there.  The thick sauce was extremely salty, without much other flavor. It did have large pieces of white meat chicken and pork, which would have tasted great if the sauce wasn't so bad.\n\nThe price was average, but the food was below average. I am definitely willing to return and try the teppanyaki bar, as the energy and food produced on that side of the restaurant was definitely better than what I received.",0

3329,"So excited about finally getting me some Wendy Noodles Cafe. SInce I only keep hearing rave reviews from all the yelpers been blessed enough too have meet in life. Always fan of asian food and just fan of small free standing family own spots around town. Wendy Noodles Cafe has that vibe but also some of the food there putting out real creative and tasty. Since I was only my first visit BUT far from my last never really got into the interesting stuff. \n\nThe things I did try was the mango and shrimp salad, rib-eye Bao Burger, and order of kalbi. The mango salad was awesome! Refreshing BIG time with the mixed organic greens with nice spicy dressing, ample amount of fresh mango in the salad and the shrimp came on skewers two of them. I only wished they used the bigger size shrimp. Still it had really nice crust on the outside, taste the marinade or sauce on it (Really could have just ordered the shrimp on the skewer by itself), and nice size salad. It first course for me. Salad lot of food. Honestly feel Pan Asian mango and shrimp salad is better and really in league all its own........The rib-eye Bao Burgers more like sliders that just poop in your mouth. Two or three bites later want more more. Unfortunately only get three per order. The combination of the steamed bun and the rib-eye perfect on point! I love the flavor, and moist throughout every bite. The steam bun found memories of peking duck, steam bun, and oyster sauce. It not duck but for sure its next best thing combine with steam bun!!!!!!! Kalbi been craving so had too get order. The Kalbi was tapas style so don't expect full order just tease. It good tease. The flavor loved it. Just wished they had full order on the menu. It came with little kim chee. I really enjoyed the kim chee. It not too spicy spicy but just right. Just wished had more room too try more of the menu.\n\nThe menu is pretty large or felt like good size for small restaurant. I felt was  different they offer full page of tapa style food (hence where ordered the kalbi; most part all the items are under $10). Given it was my first check in another thing notice they add lot of new items throughout the menu from the new item logo. The desserts they offer shave ice. Yet another reason count on return visit. Really little of everything on the menu. \n\nService was great! They never rushed me came too my order. Never had empty glass. My last course the kalbi. I liked the fact they gave me heads up that one of the dishes that expect 10-15 mins. Kalbi it well worth the wait. \n\nWendy Noodles Cafe see you very soon my friend! So much more too try!!!",1
3330,"Went in with a group on Monday around 1pm. The place wasn't busy at all, so I was expecting service to be pretty speedy. WRONG! We waited almost 10 minutes for our drinks to be delivered. One persons drink didn't even come, so after another 10 minutes of our server being nowhere, he magically appeared and ordered him another one. 5 minutes later, I personally had to go grab it from the bar because our server was nowhere to be found again. \n\nafter ordering, it took about 35 minutes for our food to come out. A buddy and I split the Blue Cheese Sliders and the Hangover Fries. The sliders came out with no blue cheese on them and the fries looked and tasted like they had been sitting under the heat-lamp for about 10 minutes. And again, our server was nowhere to be found when we needed drink refills and to ask about the food. \n\nTo top it off, a few in our group decided to sit at the bar after our meal and wait for our ride to come. We all ordered beers from their amazing CRAFT selection (Coors Light, Blue Moon, Dos Equis, Alaskan Amber, New Castle, Perroni). Wow, those all sound like domestics to me. \n\nAs we were drinking our beers, we noticed that the bar was swarming with FLY's! EVERYWHERE! Flies and Gnats were on everything; the plates, glasses, bottles, the beer taps. \n\nThis place is to be avoided at all cost. It may look good on the outside but everything on the inside is messed up.

Our first floor room has a sliding door that opens onto a patio right in front of the pool and hot tub. There, you can relax with twenty of your best friends, have a BBQ, or drink at the open air bar. This is more like South Beach than the American West, and I love it. \n\nThe whole place has a relaxed party vibe. (Someone initially told me it was a swinger hotel, and the in-room cocktail shaker/privacy curtains on the patio make me believe it, but nobody's actually hit on me, so...?) Staff are friendly; the cafe serves fresh, tasty food. The gym is also pretty nice--ear buds, towels, iced lemon water and fresh apples complement modern, clean machines. \n\nHotel Valley Ho's location near downtown Scottsdale also doesn't hurt.

After we had been seated in a semi-private room in super comfortable reclining chairs, our head, neck and shoulders were massaged while our feet soaked in warm water. Once we were all nice and relaxed our feet were given the much needed attention they deserved. I even fell asleep for a little bit I was so relaxed.

I am rather bummed because this place is not far from where I live.  \n\nMy sister and I ordered chicken, carnitas, and carne asada tacos to share.  The carne asada was the best of the 3, but nothing to write home to mom about.  The carnitas was overcooked and crispy/burnt/dry.  The chicken taco was pretty good, but again nothing exciting.  The sauces (green and red salsa) were not very spicy and rather blah.  I can say the service was very fast and the prices were cheap.  Most of the tables were not cleaned off in the restaurant.  Also, we ordered everything without guacamole and that seems to be their claim to fame, so maybe we are a bit biased and missing out on the key ingredient.  \n\nI will be back if I am in desperate need of a taco nearby, but I will hopefully find a better place before that desperate moment occurs.",0

This feat is achieved, as is so often the case with my favourite takeaways by offering rice as a separate item rather than as an item included in the price.\n\nI pass through here on my way home and along here you get a line of very good and very friendly, with this place no exception, shops that will serve your needs most admirably.  As a result, I'm more than happy to stop here to visit the shops that have remained open and if it's late enough or indeed sometimes early enough in the day pick up a meal on my way and then cook the rice myself when I get in.\n\nAs the meals go, these start at \u00a33.90 and go up from here without really venturing beyond a fiver so it's certainly good value for money.

3343,"My wife and I have been anxious to try this place since seeing it on Restaurant Impossible, especially since it's pretty close to an area we frequent.  The parking lot is a total cluster.  The outside of the establishment is ho-hum.  The interior is just as I remembered it from RI, but nothing spectacular.  Upon entering we were immediately greeted and told we could take a seat wherever we liked.  Unfortunately, the hostess wasn't the only thing that greeted us.  We were immediately hit with an incredibly foul odor.  I thought perhaps it was some kind of chemical smell.  My wife was sure it was more like a damp, mildew/mold funk.  Either way it was pretty overwhelming.  We were given some menus which, despite the sign outside indicating \""""Breakfast and Lunch\"""", only seemed to contain breakfast items.  As it was already after noon and we were seeking lunch, we asked for, and received, lunch menus.  Nothing on the menu seemed spectacular to me.  During this time a young lady (I think her name was Bree) had already taken our drink order, continuing with what appeared to be pretty decent service.  By the time our drinks arrived we seriously hated the stench which filled the entire establishment.  There were two or three other tables filled with customers.  I assume they had all been in a combat environment which rendered them unable to smell; otherwise I can't imagine how they had consumed a meal in this joint.  Upon a bit of further discussion regarding the retched smell, we decided to leave a few bucks on the table to cover the iced tea, and bail out.  We did just that.  The smell was so bad we couldn't even stay to try to the food.  Never again.  This one is off the list.  I had high hopes, but this place didn't live up to the \""""smell test\"""".",0

3346,"I would say this was more of a 3.75 experience, but we must round up to 4 stars. \n\nMy friend and I dined at Andre's at 5:30 PM with a TravelZoo coupon for $99 which gets two people two pre-fixe three course meals with two cocktails. Yes, that is an amazing deal, so basically $50 per person (with gratuity included). Andre's gets two-thumbs up for the deal in the first place, and even more thumbs up for quickly providing the pre-fixe menu selections to us and delivering our complimentary cocktails amazingly quick as soon as we sat down.\n\nAndre's is a fascinating dining experience, with a quiet, dark, yet very refined dining room. The servers are quick to please and you can tell they enjoy the food, explaining it, presenting it, and even, in a flourish, taking it off your table when you are done. I absolutely adore the gold dome covers for some of the dishes that come out. I also truly admire their plating and the colors of the plates/style which reminded my friend and I of Tiffany's.  \n\nAppetizer - Foie Gras with fig/apple reduction. A medley of savory and sweet, cooked perfectly, with a slight, crisp exterior, and a melt-in-your-mouth, buttery interior. Presentation could use some refinement, but overall pleased with the dish. (BTW - this was not on the Pre-Fixe Menu)\n\nPre-Fixe Starter: French Onion Soup - Ee gads, the soup was inedible. I tried to eat some, but could not. The top was charred too much. It must have sat under the broiler to melt the cheese for too long. One of my croutons simply looked like a black coal, I kid you not. \n\nEntree - Rib eye, with potato cake and broccolini. I have never been a fan of broccolini. I would much rather have plain old broccoli, mostly because it's just easier to eat. However, it was well cooked and had a bite to it, so at least it was not flaccid and inedible. The potato cake tasted like hash browns, but in a square cake form. The rib eye was tender, ordered medium, and honestly very good. Although I recently had a more expensive rib eye that has kind of ruined a lot of meat for my in general. None the less this one was the best part of my entree.\n\nDessert - Creme brulee with seasonal fruit. Presentation was perfect, but the bowl was too shallow! Ahem, I mean, I can always use more creme brulee! Although the portion was small, it was still a creamy creme brulee, with only the slightest crackle to the top, which I prefer over a harder char on my dessert.\n\nOverall Andre's is kind of a diamond in the rough of Monte Carlo. It should definitely be on any fine-dining \""""must do\"""" list though. I would certainly return, especially since they appear to feature seasonal tasting menus and happy hours.",1
3347,"I would have to say the best thing about CSS is the interior.  Very well done and offers a great ambiance.  The food on the other hand was rather disappointing.  I tried the Brisket, Spare Ribs, Sausage, potato salad, mac and cheese and corn bread.  For the most part everything was pretty bland and lacked a good smoke flavor.  The brisket was moist but no ring which leads me to believe it was put on the smoker to give it some color but then was taken off and wrapped and placed in an oven.  The sausage had a good smoky color and flavor but the spices within the sausage were nothing more than you find in a store bought sausage.  My sides were overall bland and the corn bread was very dry.  \nI was able to try some samples from my friends meals and I would say the beef rib was very well done and tasty.  The pie was also very good.  \nThe food is served cafeteria style which is difficult for me to get past, It lends itself to questioning how long ago the food was prepared.  Also I did not get a strong smell of smoke inside the restaurant.  \nOverall I think CSS would be a viable BBQ option for the area if they were not located right next to another BBQ joint.  They have stiff competition and currently are lacking in the flavor department by a long way.",0
3348,"I had higher hopes for this place, the chicken wasn't well seasoned there was no kick to it. Corn bread was too sweet, the only thing I did enjoy from this joint was the rice with gravy. Overrated! I give it a 2.5.",0
3349,"Realllllly wish I had known about Kaze sooner because their 50% off sushi ends on Saturday, June 22nd. That's where you'll find me this Saturday!  \n\nThe sushi here is fresh and the rolls are unique. They don't serve edamame (or maybe it was just that one time), which is a little strange to me, but nonetheless the food we received was delicious. After this Saturday, they will have the \""""All you can eat\"""" option for those of us sushi lovers.\n\nCurrently 50% off on most of the sushi items (everything aside from the Chef Specials).  6 rolls + 2 diet cokes cost us $43 (minus tip) - not bad! \n\nI have been to Sushi Fever, Sushi Bomb, Tokyo Sushi, Sushi on Rainbow, and Tokyoto Sushi - some more than others - and I have to say Kaze took the cake this time.",1
3350,"Butterfield's is in my neighborhood.   Have been a customer from almost their first day open. Rock solid breakfast. Lots of regulars there. All of the standards plus a few greats (the bacon skillet with poached eggs on top is a good one!) I have had breakfast at \""""Butterball's\"""" (as my teenagers affectionally refer to it) probably in excess of 50 times.  If you are a hater, go somewhere else, more room for those of us who love good service, a smile and a breakfast that is as fit or fattening as you desire.  I have had just about everything on the menu, including lunch, and my only complaint is their coffee.  A bit bitter.  Love, love, love the OJ.  On Sundays, get there early before the post-church crowd....",1

Still the same pizza that you will either love or hate.\n\nThe Pizza here has the chesse and topings put on after they cook it so it melts some while you eat it.  Tastes really good.  \n\nI also has the apetizer sampler which was a lot of food for two people.\n\n\nWas not to crowded, but full Saturday at lunch.\n\nHighly recommended.",1
3353,"Had Brunch here today.  Fantastic Prime Rib!  Shrimp salad was great as well.  Enjoyed the walk up do it your self Bloody Mary station. Great way to set it up.  Our waitress was right on time, offered refills and clean plates (for seconds) without our asking.  The manager came to the table twice just to check on us and made sure we had the right seating for the baby.  \n\nAll in all a very nice fathers day in a fun pub.  Will be back.",1
3354,"I really wanted to give this place a better rating, I really did.  The food at King's Kitchen is amazing (though a tiny bit pricey) and the restaurant seems to have a really great purpose.  However, after the treatment we got on our anniversary I doubt I'd ever go back.  My husband and I went to the restaurant to celebrate eleven years of marriage.  We were expecting a special event, especially after reading all the glowing reviews.  What we got was a waitress who treated us like dirt, while treating her only other table at the time like old friends.  \n\nWe sat at our table, and when we saw a woman roll her eyes as she stared our way I whispered to my husband \""""Oh man.  I hope she's not our waitress.  She looks like she hates us already!\""""  Lucky us, here she came.  She said nothing about specials, gave us no suggestions, had to come back to hear our drink orders TWICE, and all we ordered was tea.  And ten minutes later, when a couple of women sat in her section across from us, we got the jealous privilege of watching her gush all over these ladies, telling them in detail the specials and what came with them, which dishes were good and even telling one of the women to try a dish she had told five minutes earlier me was SOLD OUT.  What?  And while our appetizer sat on the counter where we could see it, she held a ten-minute conversation with these ladies about the conference they were attending and oh my gosh, we're all from the same hometown?  What a coincidence!  Let's talk some more!  After that the loud PLUNK as our appetizer was carelessly thrown on our table was audible throughout the restaurant.  Before we could even request a refill on our tea, she was gone, back to finish the conversation our appie had so rudely interrupted.\n\nWe didn't get our food for forty minutes, during which time we got to watch our neighbors, who arrived fifteen minutes after us, dig into two plates of delicious-looking food.  By the time we got our tepid but delicious meals we had already been in the restaurant for an hour and twenty minutes and we were actually feeling like nuisances.  We honestly should have complained to a manager, but we had to get to our other anniversary plans.  If I had it to do all over again I would have said something.  As it is they've lost us as customers.  If I'm going to pay that much for dinner, I'd like to be treated like a human being at least.  \n\nThe funny thing is the ladies and that waitress had more than their hometown in common, and though I'd hate to think prejudice came into play, it seems to be a very plausible possibility.  I just don't know why a woman who is so friendly to other people could look at us and decide we were worthless scum without knowing us.  But that's what happened.  The difference in the way they were treated and the way we were treated was astoundingly obvious.",0
3355,"Forgettable experience. Asked our waiter what is popular, he said to toss a coin. We choose 2 cioppinos. Even after a 50% off comp! it came to $68 with tip. They added 18% automatically without informing me. I caught it right before tipping out myself. For value and great seafood, I'll stick to Tides at Green Valley Ranch. Shame on you guys! But hey, your bread was good. I'll give you that!",0
3356,"We like a good donut every once in awhile. Dunkin Donuts is usually great...but this Surprise one blows. There is nothing worse than having a craving for a Bavarian creme donut, just to get there and find out that they do not have any. This is the norm for this Dunkin. Every time we go there they never have the Bavarian creme donut. If it is soooo popular you would think they would want to keep them in stock so they could profit off of them. Guess that is not the case with this place.",0
3357,"Encore and Wynn are definitely the nicest hotels in Las Vegas in my opinion. I would give this a 5 star review but our room was smaller than i was anticipating. I got suite with two queens and a corner couch and i was comparing it to Palazzo and Palazzo had a much better layout, it was bigger, and had a cool sunken area where the couch went. With that being said almost everything else is nicer here at the Encore. This hotel is beautiful. \n\nEncore is expensive but ive learned why it is worth staying here. They have 3 of the coolest clubs in Las Vegas. XS, Surrender, Tryst to a lesser extent. We stayed here for a bachelor party, and since we were guest we went to concierege and paid for our tickets there. around 10:30 all 5 of us GUYS walked right past the GIGANTIC line and walked right into the club, absolutely no wait!!! It was awesome! The other way you save money is that you dont have to take expensive cab rides getting from your hotel to Encore or Wynn, And you also dont have to take the annoying cab ride after the club. The convenience to drink up, walk down stairs, walk right into the club, then walk right back upstairs was so nice. I cannot stress it enough. If you factor in transportation, Bribing the bouncer (for an all guy party) and paying more for drinks because you dont have them convenienctly upstairs) then you end up paying about the same as staying at a cheaper casino. Think about it and enjoy!\n\n\nPS. They have a nice mall across the street with a big food court for when you dont want to spend a ton of money on food.",1
3358,"Terrible and rude service, disappointing.  Friend applied and had interview, Red Robin didn't even have the courtesy to call back.... Food was cold and undercooked, appetizer was decent.  Too many place to eat at, be treat well, get great food and tip 25% that we are comfortable tipping when the restaurant deserves it.  This one did not.  Highly unrecommended.",0
3359,"High expectations meet reality.\n\nAnd please someone change that $$ to $$$.\n\nService was so-so, with weak recommendations from the waitress.  Here's what we ordered:\n\n- Escargots de Bourgogne (oven-roasted snails, garlic-herb butter) - pretty good\n\n- Housemade Country Pate (cornichons, whole grain mustard, warm country bread) - a LOT of pate, too little bread, I liked this dish, but talk about disparity b/t the two.\n\n- Chicken Liver Mousse (burgundy red wine mustard, toasted brioche) - same as above, with respect to mousse to bread ratio - too much mousse, too little bread.  I was looking forward to this dish, but that burgundy red wine mustard is just nasty and overpowering), pass!\n\n- Sea Scallops Gratinees (caramelized fennel & onion marmalade, mussel cream) - thin scallops that were tasty, but surrounded by too much cheese.  Should have gone with the entree version instead, sigh...\n\n- Rack of Lamb Special - overpowering mustard sauce on the lamb that was just unpleasant.  The lamb was tender and the au jus was tasty.  Excise the sauce and it is  tasty, but $36 worth of tasty?  No.\n\n- Creme Brulee - this was the best dish of the night, nice and creamy with the right thickness to the sugary top.",0

The food was heavenly and I can't wait to return. I suggested to my sweetie that we have a monthly date night back home where we can dress up and go out to our Lawry's here in Beverly Hills.

3362,"Growing up in SoCal, I have always heard of Lawry's Prime Rib but never had the chance to try it out until restaurant week here in Vegas. During my undergrad years we toured the restaurant as part of one of my classes, so I had a good feel for what to expect when that time came I would actually partake and order some food. And let me tell you, the prime rib here is not only amazing, but huge! None of the meats are precut of course, and are not even cut in the kitcken in the back. The prime rib is cut right there in front of your eyes and onto a large plate where they also ask what kind of sides you want to accompany it as well. Man... is it good. \n\nBetween the service, the food and the atmosphere, this is one of the few places in life that did not disappoint after all these years of waiting.",1
3363,"This place makes no sense at all.  Got here Sunday during brunch time, was seated right away, but did not get a drink order till 30 mins later and then after that it was too late to order anything with eggs unless it was the steak and eggs. \nListen to the reviews, STAY AWAY unless you want to wait 30 mins for a coffee!",0
3364,"Where to start? We went for our daughter's birthday party. Took a while to get our first drinks. My gin and tonic was soda water. If there was gin in it, it was undetectable. I hate soda water. Never successfully go that corrected. And it was the same with my husband's bourbon and diet. The \""""talls\"""" were served in Dixie cups. I used a coupon for a free glass of Chardonay. Guess I should have had a draft beer. It was disgusting. The music was so loud, conversation between more than two people was an impossibility. I am familiar with the club scene, so I do have a source of comparison. Strangely, all the music I heard was from 2005-2010. I heard nothing current. Conversation was possible only if you put your mouth in contact with a person's ear.  In spite of the fact there were plenty of tables open and the table had been reserved for two hours., the server was constantly trying to move us to a smaller table as some of the party goers were not there on the dot of 9p. Weirdly, lights were turned off in the back at about 10:15p. It was so dark, we couldn't see the people in the booths beside us. Then a couple came around with a clip board asking for person information for some drawing. I politely told them I keep my private information, well, private and that I did not intend to come back. In short, try a new marketing ploy, thank you. We didn't stay long enough to eat.  Nor did we stay long enough to watch girls dance on the bar at midnight. I mean, REALLY???",0

I piled cake batter into my cup and loaded it up with brownies, caramel and fudge and rainbow sprinkles and it tasted (almost) as good as Cold Stone.\n\nTheir seating section is really cute too, much better than what I've experienced at cold stone or tcby, with colorful couches and tables.\n\nSince it's so close to my home - this place is a keeper. Can't wait til summer!!!",1
3367,"This was the first time for me visiting this establishment.  It was busy because of the Transiberian Orchestra concert but there was not a wait to be seated. The first thing I did when I walked in was order a drink.  Stella Atrois $6.15 per draft.  Its a bit expensive, but being downtown and directly across from the Console Energy Center, I expected drinks to be a little on the expensive side.  \n\nAfter I was seated with my party, we were served bottles of water at the table.  I suspect tap water in reusable glass bottles.  After, it took quite a bit for our waitress to come back to take our order. My girlfriend and I started with the Poutine Appetizer.  Again, it took a long time for our food to arrive.  The app was pretty good, but for french fries, cheese and gravy, $10 was a bit on the expensive side.  But again, downtown restaurant so it was expected.  My girlfriend also ordered a glass of white wine.  It was served in a soaking wet glass.  And when she commented on that to the waitress and asked for a different glass, the waitress almost seemed annoyed. \n\nFor dinner, I ordered the Hangover Cure Sandwich with blue cheese, garlic fries.  My girlfriend had the crab cake entree.  It took almost 45 minutes for our entrees to arrive.  There were two crab cakes about the size of a hockey puck each  (no pun intended) and the cost was $27.  This time, I expected a little but more in the portion department for $27.  When my entree arrived, everything looked great but the waitress forgot my side of ranch dressing.  She then looked at me and said \""""oh, I forgot your ranch dressing, Ill be right back with that\"""".  Needless to say, she never brought it.  It also took forever for her to bring our check, pick them up, and return them.  It almost made my friends late for the concert.  At this point, the restaurant was dead, so being busy had nothing to do with the time it took our waitress to do her job.\n\nAll in all, I would not suggest this place.  There are a lot of other restaurants downtown (and just across the river on the south side) that are a lot better bang for your buck and a lot better service.  I will not be going back.",0

3379,"Rolled up on a Tuesday night since I had to kill about 1.5 hours while waiting for someone to arrive at the airport.  Old Pewter Rose location (RIP).  Place was pretty busy and since I didn't have time to wait they offered us the counter right at the kitchen which was open.  Kind of like a Chef's table but they called it something different.\n\nThe experience was doubly awesome since we got to watch them prepare all of the yummy dishes.  We were right there facing the line cooks and chefs.  Both me and my co diner ordered the nutty fried chicken on the recommendation of the server.  It was served with sweet potato mash and asparagus.  The entire plate was quickly devoured and I must say it was very tasty.  Oh, and they started us off with one of the most wonderful, fluffy rolls that I have ever eaten.  Since I was right there I noticed a sign that said that the rolls, before being served had to be approved by a chef before going out.  Pretty cool, and maybe that contributes to the hot, doughy perfection that I ate.\n\nAll in all, it was a great experience at a renovated old favorite restaurant of mine.  I will definitely return so I can try other things on a menu that I really didn't have time to properly peruse but remember there was some pretty great stuff on it.",1

3381,"I have been looking for a doctor to help me with my fibro.  I am new to the area and trying to do research of where to go.  Wasn't very many reviews on this center so I figured I would take my chances.  The center was able to get me in the same week.  I waited 1 1/2 hours to see the doctor after my schedule appointment time.  I was with the doctor for 2 hours going over my history and symptoms. He put me on their \""""protocol\"""" for fibro.  I was to start a gluten-free, dairy-free diet and start several supplements along with the CMO.  I was planning on spending $200 because the CMO was $150 and reviews seemed to be promising.  I ended up spending $429 on the supplements and visit. I was charged $479 on my credit card.  When I questioned the office he told me that he would credit back the $50 and wasn't sure why it charged that....hmmm.  That seemed pretty fishy to me.  After a few days the credit still didn't appear.  I called and questioned them again.  He told me that it would take up to two weeks to process and that he would call his Quickbooks support and find out.  I begun to believe that it was fishy.  Now it has been two weeks and nope still no credit.  I had to file a complaint with my credit card company.\nAs far as the supplements and diet helping with my fibro, I have not noticed any difference.  It has only been two weeks and I was told it would be one to two months before noticing changes.  I will update on whether or not the \""""protocol\"""" works.  I will not be going back for a follow up because if they are going to try and rip me off once they will do it again.  I will get my supplements from a health food store and order the CMO online if I notice a difference.",0
3382,"Went here while in PHX on business with a friend who lives locally.  Thought it would be a good place to have some dinner since i love BBQ.  No such luck.  Nothing seemed like real BBq  just over cooked and tasteless.  Very Chain resturant-y,  Cool memorabilia abut that's about it.  They only give a small cup of BBQ sauce for your meal.  I don't reccommend.",0

3384,"Having already visited the Home Hardware store in Morningside, I was expecting to find more of the same at their sister store in Portobello.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that this store offers much of the same and more.\n\nFirstly, this place is very large.  I just about managed to fit it all into the photo!  It covers everything that you could possibly need for your home.  There's paint, DIY equipment, plants, home accessories and furnishings and more besides.  They also provide a delivery service, meaning that there's no need to trek out to a B&Q or Homebase, when a place as big as this is probably just on your doorstep.\n\nHonestly, I was impressed with this place.  It crams in a lot of stuff, and will succeed in dragging people away from the big chains to something more local.  These people are definitely getting it right in my opinion.",1
3385,"Went to Rosemary's last night and here are my quick impressions... I had the prix fixe for $55 and thought my meal was excellent. Started with the foie gras and it was cooked perfectly! The only thing I didn't like about it was the marmalade tended to take too much away from the foie gras, rather than complementing the flavor it almost took over too much. Then on to the beef & maytag bleu cheese carpaccio which was outstanding! For the main course I had the creole grilled prime ribeye which was not only cooked perfectly but was excellent in flavor & texture.\nMy wife had the seared scallops and thought they were amazing as well. I tried one and they were cooked perfectly and I don't think they could've been made better.\nThe reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was I felt that the service was a little lacking and by that I don't mean bad. I feel that our waiter could've been a little more attentive so hopefully next time we go that will change.\nWe will definitely be going back and I would definitely recommend this to my friends & family. The cost for one prix fixe, seared scallops and 4 drinks was roughly $120 if that helps anybody.",1

Checked in Easter Sunday and checked out Wednesday morning.  From the moment we walked into the hallway on the 29th floor, we noticed the change.  There was a huge food smear on the entrance way to our room that was disgusting to say the least.  It was never cleaned the whole time (right around shin level, about 8 inches in diameter).  Room automation was inoperable and we couldn't turn off any of the sofa lighting until midway through the 2nd day when an \""""engineer\"""" came to our room and discovered it was unplugged inside the lighting unit.  Did he bother to check any of the other features or offer to check them; no sir, he just left after plugging it in.\n\nThe once beautiful leather couch was full of food and trash; one only had to move a cushion to experience that wonderful sight.  Both chairs in the living were very unclean as well.  The chaise in the bedroom, which we loved, was missing from the room.

3390,"Since I moved to AZ from NY about a year ago, I have been disappointed  by  dozens of AZ restaurants that claim to be \""""New York Style\"""". Not just Italian restaurants. I'm just as disappointed by AZ yelpers who think they know what authentic NY style is. So it was, with trepidation, that I heeded the advice of the reviews previous to this one, and booked a table for ten for a pre theater dinner. Well, you see the five stars. How good is RigaTony ?\nLets start with service. We were pretty late for our 4:30 reservation after being stuck in traffic on the 10. They held the table, no problem, on a very busy evening. Even though we ordered our plates after 5 we got the early bird specials and the $3 glasses of wine. Again, not a problem. Our waitress was very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and very efficient. Sodas and waters were refilled without prompting. Sorry, I didn't get her name. \nThe food. Fresh Chapati comes to the table almost immediately. There are bottles of olive oil and small dishes of freshly chopped garlic too.  Make your own concoction. The early bird pasta dishes offer a good variety of  pasta and accompaniment, are plentiful, tasty and offered in fresh semolina or whole wheat and a great value at $6.95. Three of us ordered the veal parm which we all agreed was tender, tasty, and large enough to satisfy. The sauce was thick, tangy and garlicky, much like Carmines or many of the midtown (Manhattan) Italian eateries. Also ordered at our table was lasagna and a clam and mussel dish. All were very happy with their meal. The tab for it all was very reasonable.\nThis is not a franchise restaurant. It is the real deal. RigaTony could make it in NY. The fact that it is in Tempe is, i think, fantastic.",1
3391,This is an outstanding service company. They are polite and prompt on the phone. They gave a fair estimate and sound advice. Their crew arrived on time and prepped the exterior with great attention to detail. They finished in one day and the look is amazing. The clean up was just as professional as the prep. They are THE company to use for your painting needs.,1
3392,"Stayed for 4 nights in a Select guest room.  Room was clean, large and updated.  Did not try the main restaurants (a steakhouse, Italian restaurant and a 50's style diner) or the pool.   I did try the buffet which was perfectly fine and very reasonable ($21 for dinner and $18 for breakfast).  Food court was OK but could have had more options. The mall/shops are forgettable--skip those.  Was super disappointed in the  \""""free\"""" Wi-Fi though.  You get 1mb free, after that you have to pay $10 (per day I think).  Does anyone just use 1mb?  I'm not saying people should download movies or anything, but I probably use more than 1mb just checking my email!  I mean,  come on now. \n\nStill, I think overall Stratosphere provides a pretty good bang for your buck.  Reasonable price and service, free parking is super easy....I'd recommend it.",1
3393,"We went here for an Oktoberfest today after having purchased a coupon deal for admission and beverages (4 beers per person).  The place was easy to locate in Old Town Scottsdale, and on-street parking was readily available nearby.\n\nPros:\n\nSurprisingly, this was an indoor venue instead of outdoor, and it seemed more like a large beer hall with lots of old world decor, which took some of the disappointment out of being confined indoors on such a beautiful day.\n\nStaff were generally pretty friendly and helpful, seating was plentiful, the oompa band (3 local musicians) was entertaining and fun, and the craft beer (especially the Oktoberfest Lager) was very nice.\n\nCons:\n\nIn spite of having a printed (and web published) schedule of activities, the stage crew & management seemed genuinely confused as to the order of things.  When the band went on break, the sound team played loud rock music from some radio station over the PA system, rather then anything remotely themed to the event.\n\nFood offerings were meager (brats $7, soft pretzels $4, small bags of potato chips, etc).  The brats were served in a sliced, hard baguette with choice of grilled onions and/or sauerkraut, but were dry and somewhat flavorless.  In addition, there was only regular, yellow mustard available at the counter.  No spicy or German style mustard was available, but one of the staff did manage to scrounge up a small bowl of Dijon after I asked.  No other accompaniments were available, such as potato salad or fries, nor were there any desserts on offer.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this event at about a \""""2\"""", mainly because of the disorganization and poor quality of food offerings.",0

3406,"All of the reviews here are so positive! I hate to be the debbie downer, but as the rating of two star means \""""Meh. I've experienced better\"""", that's where I stand as far as this studio goes. I am not new to yoga, so perhaps I've been spoiled by previous studios. I was new to the valley and the great reviews of Spirit of Yoga led me to give them a try. I should preface by saying that I am more inclined to smaller yoga studios. \n\nPros: The place is definitely beautiful, very large studios with great interior design. The location is nice too, overlooking a small body of water with geese and ducks hanging out. They have a lot of classes at a lot times, so it makes it very convient to work some yoga into your schedule. \n\nCons: The place is busy, that's for sure. When I came for my first class I bought 5 class package, so I could give it a proper try before committing. The front desk was hectic and I was ignored for quite a few minutes before someone paid me any attention. They spoke to me like I should have known what to/where to go/etc. Anyway, I filled out my paperwork and was directed to the class. The room was large and the class was pretty full by the time it started.\n\nThe instructor led the class but stayed at the front of the class the whole time, which is understandable since it's such a large class not everyone can get personalized attention. However, I did notice that the instructors (in more than one class I attended) never corrected anyone on form, even with just voice instruction. I find this quite concerning because people can injure themselves in certain postures if not done properly. There are no mirrors, which is good and bad, in my opinion. Good because you're not distracted by watching others in the mirrors. But, bad since there were no corrections at least one could observe their body in a mirror to see if they're out of alignment. \n\nThe next two times I came back for classes the front desk couldn't find my paperwork or proof that I paid for the class. \n\nMy overall experience here left me wondering what else was out there.",0

3413,"Ok so to start the food is actually really good and consistent. The reason i rated them lower is because of the customer service. I have been several times and usually have good service, however there is one waitress that needs to have customer service lessons. Im not sure her what her cultural background is but she is Asian, prob thirties or late twenties. The last time i went there was with a group of seven. On this occasion, there was plenty of seating but there was a sign to wait, so we did. There were two waitresses one was white and one was Asian, both saw us and continued working, one was even clean a table. The  after about 5 minutes the Asian lady came over to us and sat us at a table. The first thing she said to us is \""""How are you planning to pay?\"""" i thought that was really strange and kinda rude. Im used to waitress telling u about the menu before discussing money, we looked at each other with a puzzled look and answered her and that some of us were paying cash and some were paying credit cards. Right away she responded, \""""i can't do that. I can only take up to 4 payments.\"""" we tried to figure who had cash and if we needed to sit at separate tables in order to have lunch (literally talked about payment stuff for ten minutes before we were allowed to look at the menu). After we go that worked out, she gave us a minute to look at the menu and came back and stood at the head of the table and requested our orders, requiring us to yell across the table to place our order over the noise. Isn't it a common technique of waiters to walk around the table and the order, unless your at a booth and there is sonly on place to stand? I felt it was rude. To make it easier, i placed my order over the phone as a to go order, that way she didn't have to worry  about splitting the bill and the number of payments she could take. To this day each of us talk about this experience and how we are not planning to go back. I really do like the food and want to go back but I'm tone on supporting that type of customer service. If I go back my order will be to go 100%. No need in staying there, i rather eat at the picnic table by the movie theater than be in there with that customer service and feel obligated to tip someone who isn't doing their job from a customer prospective. Overall I think they could improve their customer service, especially for seating. I typically wait about 5 minutes and every time i have gone it has always been between 2% and 25% full.",0

Carpet looked dirty.\n\nRoom had no water, no coffee and weirdest of all no clock of any kind so to tell time, I had to look at my phone each time.\n\nWhen we were leaving and picking up our car from valet, they just let our car sit there until we finally spotted it on the far side of the road and walked to it carrying our own bags only to discover it was locked, so had to trekk back to get the keys from valet station. \n\nGood location and the bed was comfy but not staying here again - gonna try Mirage or Caesar's next, they are similar in price.",0
3417,"My fianc\u00e9 and I went back to Caffe Daniel last night and it was even better than the first time.  Frankly, I don't know why we waited so long to go back. Daniel remembered us even though it had been many months since our first visit. It was seafood night last night and the food was amazing. This is a rare restaurant in that every single item on the menu is something I want to try.  We are going to make it a weekly visit for now on.",1
3418,"I've been holding out on doing a review for a several months now just to see how they would fare after several visits and trying their sizzling sisig which was pretty good but I've had better, crispier back home in the Bay. As several other Yelpers have mentioned the portion sizes could be a tad greater on certain dishes. While food and service can be spotty and uneven at times dispite never really being crazy busy -- for the most part flavors don't disappoint, they've had a few mistakes such as their banana turon which was a little doughy and had burnt caramel then the fresh lumpia which was bland and lacking flavor. Flaws are expected with a new friends and family/ mom & pop run restaurant and can overlook them as long as they continue to bang out the more consistent, quality food they've pushed out the window. \n\nTheir place is nice bright and clean, but they can turn down the TV a bit and would love to hear some old Filipino music in the background. All and all, its good to have a former MGM and Golden Nugget chef serving up some bomb home style food right up the street from me. \n\nIf you're looking for it its in the same plaza as Sushimon, tucked away in the back of the Smiths shopping plaza.",1

But I liked the fresh tartness of the lemon tart way more than the apple one. \n\nThey serve breakfast and lunch items here and it seemed like some of the folks that were dining there were definitely enjoying their meals.\n\nGreat spot to grab something quick if you're staying at The Signature.",1
3420,"Went to meet my mom for lunch last Friday with my little guy.  Instead of being greeted by the host staff, Carol walked up to me and announced that my stroller won't fit in the restaurant and that she would have to take it in the back.  What?  Ok...  This Britax B-Ready apparently warranted a scolding.  Carol was so incredibly rude and my stroller would have easily fit at a table- minus a chair.  What exactly is their procedure for wheelchairs or other special needs devices?  Do they simply not fit or are they not pleasing enough to the eye to accommodate?  They might want to come up with a better story and take a more discerning eye to the host staff.  I've always had such great experiences here in the past; what a disappointment.  We'll be over at Chelsea's.  They're cool with my wheels.",0
3421,"Like many others, I thought this place would a great addition to the plaza. \nI was wrong. To begin with, the service was poor. Our waiter was bussing tables\nand then serving others without washing his hands. However, we got lucky as the\nchef(cook) delivered our food as the waiter had disappeared for a few minutes.\nWe could see our order on the rack behind the glass, but the chef(cook) realized\nthe waiter wasn't there so he delivered it himself.\n   OK, on to the food. We ordered a meatball sandwich(11.00) and a child's portion \nof spaghetti with a meatball(7.00). My gf and I wanted to try what should be signature dishes.\nThe meatballs were ok. However, The bread did not appear homemade. \nAn Italian restaurant should never use packaged rolls. Also, the sauce was very\nsweet and tasted like it may have been at least partially, from a can. \nThe sauce certainly DID NOT have that \""""made from scratch\"""" taste and texture.\nThere are some great Italian places close to here that offer MUCH better food.",0

At $4 you will pay about what you are paying at your local Starbucks which is sad but still tasty.\n\nThey literally have everything from cookies, pastries, gelato, chocolate, nuts and even hot food.  \n\nThe prices are high but if you sample small you will watch calories and your wallet.",1
3423,"Dr. Austin is an amazing physician.  She is compassionate, caring and thorough.  She is the only physician in her office, which means when she needs to provide more time to patients before you, you will wait.  But guess what, one day that may be you--you may need that extra time.  So I have never once been upset if my appointment wasn't started at the exact minute it was scheduled.  She has been my primary doctor for over seven years and unless she retires, she will be my primary physician for the foreseeable future.  If your treatment requires more specialized treatment, she knows who and where to send you.

3426,"I love this pet store! Always have, always will. And now that I've brought my kids here, they are die-hard fans as well.\n\nThe \""""jungle\"""" motif and aesthetic of this shop sets this store apart from other pet stores. Kudos to the architects and interior designers of this store, they did an amazing job with the interior. The attention to detail is great, and one can really feel that you're in a shop at Animal Kingdom at Disneyworld. Between the roped section by the cash and the \""""wooden/bamboo\""""-like walls, the store interior is really well done. \n\nMerchandise-wise, they seem to have everything you'd need to care for and pamper your dog/cat/hamster/gerbil/bunny/bird/fish/maybe other pet type...... I'm a dog person, so I tend to gravitate to the doggie areas. Wow. Amazing dog toys and the cutest dog coats ever! All the usual dog treats and snacks and more. Pricey, yes, but there are unique products here that I've not seen elsewhere (coats and toys, particularly). \n\nAnd they have animals here. Cute, adorable, I-have-to-take-them-home-immediately animals. Specifically, they have puppies, bunnies, hamsters, gerbils, mice and rats, birds and tons of fish here. Again, I gravitate to the dog area. I know the perils of getting dogs from pet stores, and how many pet stores often get their puppies from puppy mills, and how we're not supposed to get pets at pet stores and why, but I gotta say, the animals at this store appear to be very well cared for. The staff is knowledgable about the dogs here and seem to genuinely care for them. If you asked about the puppies' pedigree, they'd probably be able to provide you with the breeders' info.",1
3427,"Whilst I do agree that Nando's is little more than glorified fast food, to stick it in the same bracket as KFC is going a bit too far. At The Colonel's place, biting down on a pus-filled tumour is more or less par for the course, as is finding a cockroach or two in your chips, but standards are much higher at Nando's. \n\nSeeing them chuck a whole chicken on the barbeque is a buzz in itself, and when you get it delivered to your table, drenched in the hottest sauce they've got, the messy tables and rough-looking punters all become irrelevant.\n\nThe meats of fantastic quality, well cooked, and just a joy to behold really. For about 9 quid you'll get half a chicken plus a couple of sides, preferably garlic bread and peri-peri sprinkled fries, and you'll stroll out that door pretty satisfied.",1
3428,"The food was not bad. We went for happy hour. I personally recommend the braised beef tacos. The service on the other hand was wretched. We sat at the bar. The bartender, \""""Dolce\"""" was the name on the receipt, acted as if her farts smelled like roses and hated being there. She also had the personality of a brick wall. It seemed as if she thought she doing us some giant, inconvenient favor by taking our order. She was accompanied by a bar-back who had a similiar too-cool-for-school attitude. It was astonishing how poor the service was, as the place was not even busy. Having worked in the industry, it was difficult for me to leave a poor tip. But then I thought she probably does not know what a good tip looks like. It was a pleasant surprise to go to a different joint on the Strip later in the evening and talk to bartender who had worked with her before. He confirmed that is how she always acts, and is surprised she has not been fired!",0

3432,"I was going to be in town on business for a couple days and this time I took some time for me to actually explore a little more of Charlotte. Pure Pizza popped up on my radar and I knew I would have to try them out. Especially since they were in one of my favorite places: the 7th Street Public Market.\n \nI went for the Pesto Pizza. Typically when I'm trying a new pizza joint I go for the trusty margherita pizza to get a nice base line of what a shop can do, but I switched it up this time and was very glad I did. I paid for my pie, got my number and found a seat in the dining area. Not too long a wait before it was time for me to dig in.\n\nThe pizza crust was crisp, but not charred. While I don't mind charred, but I know some pizza patrons do. Plenty of cheese & pesto drizzle to go around on each slice. If I ever make it back here with colleagues, I will definitely recommend getting several small pizzas so we can try a variety of flavors. I almost went back every day while I was in Charlotte, but I had to be fair and explore other options.",1
3433,"I was expecting a complete geek-fest, I must admit. I was expecting to get harassed by medieval dorks and that sort of thing. But, I was wrong. This was thoroughly enjoyable. Buy tickets at Fry's before you go and gas up because it's quite a drive with only one city between Tucson & Apache Junction. Parking was easy. I was surprised to see actual structures making up this little town of vendors, stages & game booths. There were performers, fun and delicious food at reasonable prices and cute little shops everywhere you turned. The rides were so hilarious and ingenious. Many were powered by the riders (great for wearing the kids out) or else there were operators to hand power them and there were even elephant rides. The people visiting the fair were as diverse & delightful as the fair itself. I would love to go again and would highly recommend this fest to anyone looking to get some kicks in before the summer heat sets in! OMG-VISIT THE TOMATO THROWING INSULT BOOTH (VEGETABLE JUSTICE)!!!! IT'S A RIOT!!!!!!",1
3434,"It always bothers me when people give a place less stars just based on the price. \n\nFirst of all you're in Las Vegas. They don't call it Lost Wages for nothing. Second of all it's $&@?ing lobster, in what world is lobster ever cheap? Please tell me. I'd like to live in that world. \n\nRant over. Now let's get to the nitty gritty. Lobster me's food. I had the lobsicle and the lobster bisque. The jury is still out on battered and fried lobster tail on a stick. Maybe I'm partial to grilled or broiled lobster but it was just ok. Nothing to write home about. The bisque however hit the spot. The flavor was great and there were nice little chunks of lobster throughout and it came in a bread bowl. I love bowls you can eat. Who doesn't? The only bad thing about this place is there's not enough seating. Even though it was very mall-food-esque the service was incredible. The people that work there are grade A, I don't think I had better service my entire trip. You go Lobster Me, you go!",1
3435,I absolutely love this sushi place it's right by my house so I go pretty often and their happy hour is absolutely fantastic. They have some beers a little bit of wine all the roles that they have our fresh handmade they greet you right when they walk in the door and everyone is always very friendly. The only downsides to this place would be that the service is a little slow there's usually only about one or two waitresses but all of the cook are rolling sushi rolls fresh by hand so of course that's going to take some time. In my opinion great food for a great price anytime anyone wants to grab sushi this is the first place I always suggest.,1
3436,"Last night we went to spend the $150 gift certificate our daughter gave us a year ago---was not that excited to go.  Had eaten here a few times in the past but was never very impressed with the food.  And thanks to the reviews on Yelp still wasn't keen on going.  We went early to enjoy the happy hour which some had raved about.  I ordered the house martini, a vodka I had never heard of and surprisingly it was ok.  We had the tuna etutanesca, a \""""seared\"""" tuna--it WAS NOT seared but tasty, the edamame, good, and the pretzel bites with a cold cheese fondue which had to be sent back to be warmed.  Wine selection is not good---when Mirasou is on the wine menu at such an upscale restaurant you have to wonder---at least I did.  Wasn't really hungry but decided to have dinner anyway to use up the certificate.  We started with Lobster Bisque, HORRIBLE!--wrong color, did not taste any lobster and the garnish was mussel I believe.  Wanted the grilled peach salad--no peaches available--so shared the Asian Pear Salad, and still had some left over.  It was ok.  We also shared the Carbonara, tasty.  I finished off with the gelato and coffee ---good.  So with tips and the food we ended up spending $15.00 out of pocket.  I love the atmosphere but definitely will not be going back on my dime.",0

We were able to get our fill in that 30 minutes, so I'm not sure how they are making $ on this deal, but we look forward to doing this again. I was kind of confused as to where you would order food. The place isn't laid out well and it seems as if they are short staffed. Would be a great place for a kids party.",1
3438,Super Great Food!!! The prices are not too shabby... My one flaw is the timelyness if your looking for a quick bite not the place or I suggest ordering before you come.

So, I was driving by this place and thought, \""""Hub Cap Annie's, that sounds like a cool place that has a family history in Vegas AND it's a rim shop\"""", double points.  Since I love supporting locals I navigated through a wacky intersection and made a couple of U-turns to access it.  Well it was worth it because I got a pair of pre-owned tires for just under $100.  Michelins, no less.  New they would have been at LEAST $130 EACH.

3441,"I love Shabu Shabu, and have been going to the Shabu Shabu in Henderson (I won't name to be fair) for a long time. We decided to try this place, Swish, to get something a little different. In the end, we were extremely disappointed and wish we could recommend it, but just can not. \n\nDecor and ambiance are OK. Waitress was nice. Peach tea was good. Prices fair.\n\nThe major problem was the food. We ordered chicken and beef with shabu shabu and sukiyaki. Firstly, the sukiyaki and dipping sauces were way too salty and just not appealingly flavored. Secondly, the chicken was in chunks, not sliced, and had all sorts of cartilage and chewy bits. The chunks wouldn't cook because they were too thick.. The chicken was completely inappropriate and also tasted bad because it was served marinated in some sort of sauce that neither of us liked. I just couldn't eat the chicken at all. My companion ate it just so we wouldn't waste it, but he didn't like it either. The beef was ok, and sliced appropriately, and I ate that in the shabu shabu, but without a good dipping sauce was ultimately just disappointing. I like cabbage, but they served way too much of it and not nearly enough of the other vegetables or tofu or noodles.\n\nThe minor problem was the hot pots. They were extremely shallow, and the waitress didn't pay attention to them, so they were constantly boiling down, and at multiple points were down to almost nothing, so we couldn't cook our food.\n\nI left hungry, and sad.",0

3443,"We booked 2 rooms from Mar 20th - 23rd, with one room being a Grand Tower Queen room and the other room being a West Wing King room. My wife and I have stayed in a GT room before so we decided to stay in the WW room this trip and let my parents and brother have the GT room. The GT room was the same set up as last time we were there and my parents had no complaints with the room. \n\nHere is where our trip started to go south. We check into our room in the WW and head up to it. We walk in and it is quite modern with newer faucets and so on. I begin to check out the room, even though it was pretty small and not much space. As I'm looking at the art piece on the wall I see that there has been previous guests who thought it would be funny to write throughout the art work. I'm not a snob or prude by any mean but I would think the MGM would want to try and cover up any vandalism or bad look in there rooms. I then go to turn on the Bose stereo in the room to find that it does not have an Aux port (which is says on the stereo itself) as well as a bobby pin sticking out the antenna to try and get reception which clearly did not work. This really isn't a big deal cause we all have Pandora or Itunes on our phones so we would be ok. Then we go to take a shower and with in 15 minutes we have to turn off the shower completely due to the severe drainage problem that caused a 3 inch pond in our shower. We're starting to become a little unhappy with the room for the amount that we paid but we're trying to make the best out of it because we are in Vegas. Finally as we are getting ready to go out for the night we notice a pretty bad crack as well as water damage and water bubble in our ceiling above the television. I understand that all hotel rooms may come with problems but I feel for the amount of money we paid ($250+/night) this was pretty ridiculous. \n\nI spoke with a few different managers throughout the weekend. They sent a maintenance guy to our room to look at the drainage problem. He was there about 5 minutes and told us everything was taken care of. The drain was better but it still backed up on us a little bit. I had to then contact the front desk around 1:00 AM since they failed to call me like they said they would with an update. The manager who I spoke with said the ceiling damage was from a previous water leak and our property would be damaged. So what your telling me is that it's normal for a room to be damaged and still rent that room. Instead of properly handling the leak and maybe re-drywall the ceiling or at least patch it. A room change was offered to us around 1:30 AM (Fri Night/Sat Morn) but the inconvenience of moving all of our unpacked items was not worth the room change. They ended up refunding us $56 which was the resort fees and tax.\n\nI've stayed at MGM numerous times before with usually good trip reports. I even have a bachelor party booked here for Aug so I am a loyal Mlife member. This trip did change my view and overall feel for this casino.",0
3444,"I came here with friends for restaurant week, and was it an experience. If you're a meat lover, this is the place to go. Bring your appetite and friends to eat some delicious foods.\n\nI went with several friends and upon entry (valet parking is available) I saw that it was two floors, sadly I didn't get to see upstairs, but there is supposed to be a full bar and more tables. I sat downstairs right next to the huge salad bar which had so many selections I wasn't sure if I should have ate more or less. But, to counteract the amount of meat I was going to be eating I ate a plate of salad mixed with a little of everything they offered at the bar. Which had a very decorative overhead, made of wood boards that dangled from the ceiling and lights from them.\n\nThere was so many things I ate that I didn't know the name of lets just say that the majority were good. I did however enjoy their soup, which was sort of a squash or pumpkin bisque. It was creamy and it melted in your mouth. Users could add parmesan and I believe chives on the soup which made it even more delicious. It kind of reminded me of the lobster bisque i had out in San Francisco.\n\nNext, I ventured into the meats and the main course. I flipped my token to say \""""More, please\"""" and immediately servers came rushing to my side offering things from Chicken wrapped in bacon to parmesan encrusted pork. I believe I tried everything they offered except the sausages. The waiters were very friendly, however I did feel a little rushed because of their energy of serving you and making your dining experience one of a kind. They did however make a lasting expression on me as well as the quality of the meats that were presented.\n\nThe steaks, you would just ask what kind of cut you would like and they would slice you a piece. The steak had all sorts of cuts (well done, medium, medium rare, and I didn't order rare but I'm pretty sure they could have found it). While they were cutting it, you would take the prongs they provided and take it from them and put it on your plate. Note, a bottle of wine goes a long  way with eating all these meats, preferably of course red wine. For me, we drank a bottle of pinot noir to wash down all these delicious meats.\n\nOnce I had my share fair of meats, I definitely saved a little space for a nice dessert. I ordered the Fruit Passion with Chocolate Mousse. The mousse was in a rack that was heated by a candle so the chocolate was warm. Take a little of the fruit passion and mix it in the chocolate mousse and you get a sweetness that is hard to explain. I kind of felt that the passion actually had some kind of carbonation in it, but I can't be certain.\n\nOverall, this was a wonderful restaurant and an experience in Charlotte when others come here around the surrounding area to try something new. I highly recommend it if you like meats and a good time.",1

The Roast Beef and cheddar looked pretty good.  But it wasn't.  It had a weird sort of taste, and with every other bite or so I would notice these odd little mushroom bits...you know like the canned mushrooms, and the seasoning and added flavors were not to my liking.

3450,I have always shopped at Kohl's but I must say that I am dissatisfied with their customer service.  We registered at Kohl's for our wedding and we received several duplicate items. The customer service department would not allow us to get cash back with a gift receipt.  Our only options were to put the amount back on the gift giver's credit card or to receive a store credit.  I think people should be aware of this in case they register for big items like we did and then you end up with a lot of Kohl's merchandise credit.,0

No, it's not gourmet Chinese, but it's tasty enough.\n\nBut then we come to the weakness of this location: The menu.\n\nThe selection is really, really slim. To the point they don't even have sweet and sour chicken, for crying out loud. I'm used to Panda Express locations varying in their options (Potato Chicken and String-Bean Chicken are always hard to come by), but this one really takes the cake as far as limited selection goes.",0
3452,"The menu is vast and we've had a good sampling of it over the years including Tom Ka Koong, Tom Ka Kai, Larb salad, pot stickers, and fried trout lemon grass. All of which I would recommend without hesitation. I've eaten the red, green and panang curries which are usually all good. On my last trip I ordered the panang curry and it was a bit disappointing as the chicken and green beans were over cooked and a bit short on the red pepper slices. \nThe walls are finished with wood paneling and carvings which are 1 part traditional and 1 part dated but its a nice break from the ultra hip granite steel and marble of vegas' upscale dining scene. Well known tunes from the last 3 decades seep out of the speakers at a level which doesn't interfere with conversations. Even at near capacity, the room is still quiet enough to feel relaxed but energized.\nI requested booth seating and the hostess guided me to the one remaining spot. Gracious considering that several parties came in after me and I was taking up a four top alone. Years ago when I first found Pin Kaow, service was slow and you likely had to ask when you were ready for your check. It seems that feedback from customers has shaped the restaurant into a more western service style, wait staff make frequent visits and your check comes as soon as  you are finished. The jury's still out on whether this is an improvement as there's something to be said about the Thai pace of dinner. \nI thanked the waitress for bringing me a chang with one of four mangled Thai phrases I've memorized. She pressed her palms together in an elegant wai and said \""""kaa\"""". The shift ended for my waitress and my desert was served by a waiter who was just as polite. The manager kept an eye on all tables and greeted customers as they were seated. \nIf you live in Henderson or South Vegas this restaurant is easy to reach and prices, food and service all rate well. Bookmark now and stop in for dinner some time. They also have a well placed outdoor seating area. Saa-waa-dee kaap.",1
3453,"My family and I have had our Phoenix zoo membership for 1 year now. We love it! It is worth every penny. We go at least 1 time per month and always have a great time. The volunteers are extremely friendly, we have only met 1 who was not. Even when it is too hot in the summer to do anything outdoors we go to the zoo. We play at the water park then go straight home. \n\nWe watch many families (parents) rushing their children through the zoo to the point that the kids don't have fun. With a membership we are always walking at a leisurely pace. Sometimes we go and only see a hand full of animals. Sometimes we go to ride our bikes around and don't stop at the animals at all. \n\nWe love that the new Kimono Dragon exhibit is in, and are excited to see the Orangutan exhibit being started. My daughter is learning quite alot at the zoo. At 5 she is already interested in traveling the world to see these animals in their native habitat. \n\nNow, I must say... If you have been to the San Diego zoo, please realize that the Phoenix Zoo can not compare. So, don't go to the Phoenix Zoo expecting anything more than a great zoo for education purposes. But, it is the 2nd best zoo I have been to. \n\nMy family is from a small city in Arizona. We moved to Phoenix primarily due to the culture a big city can provide for raising children. I chose to live in S. Scottsdale specifically because the Phoenix zoo is about 2 miles away from my home.",1
3454,"I've been to this DSW on numerous occasions. I've purchased boots, running shoes, sandals, and even house slippers here. I've also bought socks and even a wallet on my past ventures. \n\nI think the store is well kept, bright and clean like all DSW's of course. I love the way DSW has their shoes at the level of your hip, so you can see the shoes clearly. \n\nMost recently my mother purchased a pair of Nike shoes for my brother for Christmas, but unfortunately it was the incorrect shoe. We took them back and the employees were more than happy to issue a refund with no problems. While we were there I bought a new pair of Rocket Dog slippers for $29.99. I love cheap shoes!\n\nI kind of flip flop about whether or not DSW truly deserves 5 stars, but so many of my trips here have ended in success with no problems that I feel I must say it is as good as it gets in shoe purchasing.",1
3455,"We had lunch at  Joyride yesterday. Absolutely amazing. Fabulous service, fun atmosphere and the tacos were off the charts. I had the Carne Asada, chicken Tinga and Ahi tuna tacos. All were amazing but my favorite was the Chicken Tinga. \n\nI would highly recommend this spot. I will certainly be returning soon.",1
3456,"The guys at 1day are courteous enough just not very professional at running a business.  They are very disorganized, can't keep appointments they schedule, lose many parts, etc. They do the job but don't take care of the details like leaving over spray everywhere, scratching up the trim and glass, and again...lose more parts.  It will take about 5x longer than they tell you to get it done.\nDefinitely would not recommend One day Paint & Body.",0
3457,"Lets talk about popcorn.  The worst popcorn is served here.  The amer..Dental Association must give them money to serve this popcorn.  Cinemark popcorn is really good. Only one cashier to sell tickets, 7 people serving food.  The lines were very long on Tuesday.  The theatres are fine.",0
3458,I really wanted to like this place. I even prematurely took a menu because I thought I would be ordering dinner as take out from this place as everything looked super healthy in a biggest loser sort of way. I ordered the Antioxidant Salad (see photo) and it was AWFUL. The lettuce was fresh looking but had tons of wilted slimy pieces on it. The chicken or turkey was dry and chewy. The walnuts were not candied and the salad dressing was non existent. Basically this salad was not even edible and I ended up throwing it out after I picked out the edible bits. Sad:(,0
3459,"We had breakfast at this place because we were gambling at the Old Downtown. The server was kind of too honest. One of my friend asked for a carrot juice and our server said it was nasty! Food was ok, nothing special. The hammer came when we got the bill, it was $72, my friend put $20 cash, another friend $25 on his credit card and another friend $12 on his credit card, we told the waiter to put the rest on my card. when I opened the bill, it was $56!?!?!?!?!? How is that possible. So we told him, he is trying to explain us how we were wrong and he was right. After a few minutes,he realized it didn't add up. He said I'm not good at Maths!!! Hello you using a fancy cash register!!! Please stay away from this dinner!",0
3460,"I love this place... and I'm slightly bias because I come here so much everyone in this joint knows me by name. Don't get fancy and try to order thai or chinese food here. Stick to the Vietnamese food. I like their pho, pork chops and cubed steak. This place does get a little rowdy the later it gets into the AM (partiers) Can't beat that it's 24hrs!",1
3461,"I really enjoyed my stay here. The entire property is very hip and comfy. The rooms are large with cool decor. The restaurant, Cafe ZuZu, serves great food and drinks. The pool is fabu. And the spa is a the perfect spot to be pampered (even for us guys). The location is also a plus; close to downtown and the arts district. I recommend this hotel and look forward to my next stay.\n\n*The Hotel Valley Ho is a gay-friendly TAG Approved property.",1
3462,"I absolutely love this gym! It's pretty much always busy, but never so busy that you can't workout. They have top of the line equipment and it is always clean. Every time I walk in, everyone is super nice and welcoming. Also, even though we all need to make a buck, there's no car salesman feeling when they talk to you about buying a membership or personal training. \nThey have an outdoor swimming pool - which is a MAJOR plus! They also have an outdoor turf with an awning so you can workout without the sun baking you. You have to bring your own basketball but they have a great court!",1
3463,"Read rave reviews for the burger, so we tried it. Just ok, could have more flavor. Sweet potato fries were limp and soggy too. The wait was also really long, but it's more because it's a small restaurant I think. \n\nI guess it's sort of the only burger joint in Squirrel Hill, but I think i'd go somewhere else instead.",0
3464,This place was great.  My sister & I were in town for the weekend from Cali...and we wanted to find a fun happy place to eat.\n\nThis place had food that melted in your mouth...I got the prime rib.\nWe sat on the patio which was wonderful.  The waitress was great. She knew her stuff & kept an eye on us while taking care of other people.  \n\nGreat memories...thanks!,1
3465,"OK, Here goes! Saturday night date- I picked where I wanted to go. Crap! MISTAKE #1.  IPIC  sucked once again and this is the 3rd time I was there! I don't mind spending my dates bucks on high  priced things to do and eat- nor my own money for that matter,if it means I  get to stay  in my neighborhood-Scottsdale but this IPIC theater  is such a rip off in more ways than one..Here me out! Honestly!\nWe buy the tickets for $54.... and I head for the  bathroom.  A huge line of women in the bathroom (which is gorgeous) BUT--..there is NO toilet tissue in the stalls! The crappiest thing about that is- the women coming OUT of the stalls do NOT say a fking word to the ones waiting in line to use the stalls. Really? And they are smiling! nasty bitches- ya have to wonder now- how clean those fancy loungers really are now with them sitting their un-wiped ass's on the movie seats now. Ok- here is what happens next.  Theater #7, Saturday night,Feb 25th, 9:30pm  show. We find our seats and once the movie starts- our seats are vibrating like someone is kicking them from behind! I keep looking around and no one is in back of me...then, I realize it's the sound system! Now that is annoying to have to sit in a seat that is vibrating- NOT the good vibrating way (naughty people)  but super annoying way...Ok, next-The sound system was so messed up in this theater that  it actually became an annoyance to sit thru the rest of the movie being tortured by the bad BROKEN sound system that shoots out a high pitch every 5 minutes. Warning too- People that  must drink vino and alcohol in the movies and eat in the movies, are FAT slobs. Just saying the truth. They were making noises, the waiters are getting in the way of the movie screen and they are all  talking loudly cause they are DRUNKEN ass holes- and  then- the smell of their drunken  farts from them stuffing foods in their pie holes and drinking during the movie is disgusting. Hello Cine Capri- here I come-never again to be in the IPIC itty bitty theater of human gas bombs- bringing my own toilet paper  and jiggling in the sticky chairs form the nasty women who didn't wipe their %$#@ in the bathroom.",0
3466,"Big fan of this chain. Love the chicken artichoke dish and the voodoo tuna. Recently discovered brunch, I got the quesadilla with tomatillo sauce and it was delicious. My man got the french toast, big, fluffy and tasted like candy. \n\nNow the best part: $3 your choice of vodka and a MAKE YOUR OWN BLOODY MARY BAR!!! Whoohoo! They have everything you can possibly imagine, including 4 different mixes to choose from.",1
3467,"I want to paint my bedroom.  I found a color I thought might work and as luck would have it my local Ace Hardware was the place for it.  So I dropped in there this morning thinking I would purchase a sample size to see how the color looked on the wall.  \nThe guy who was providing me customer service informed me \""""we don't give samples\"""". I explained I was expecting to pay for a sample, not be given one and his response was buy a quart or nothing.  No sample sizes for paint.  No wonder Ace Hardware stores are struggling to survive.  Who buys paint without a sample first? I mean, Home Depot, Lowes, Sherman Williams, they all have sample sizes.  And they all have better customer service.",0
3468,"Very silky & light with no ice chips. Just like hkg, sin, tpe. I hope taro flavor will be available soon. Went back for my 2nd visit,  but it was closed because the generator overheated on Saturday,  June 8, 2013. Already miss its perfect shaved cream dessert.",1
3469,"Dr. Sotelo is a Buckeye's fan, how can you go wrong here?  \n\nBeside being from the same area in the Midwest as Dr. Sotelo I have been taking our children here for several years.  We have always been treated well by the staff and Dr. Sotelo.  There is hardly any issues with scheduling an appointment and they don't make you wait forever in the waiting room or the exam room.\n\nI saw Dr. Cannon for the firstime on my last visit there and was pleased with his evaluation and treatment of my daughters issues.",1
3470,"The best place to support when you need to get quality food, toys, or accessories for your pets!  The store owner is always knowledgeable and always have treats for your dog if you bring them in.  She is always willing to help me find just what I need and usually has samples of different types of foods.  Prices here are great and it's a very nice addition to the Lakeside neighborhood.",1
3471,Great place to get sushi on this side of town. Servings of the raw fish in rolls and nigiri dishes are above average size. The flavor is amazing. The tiger roll is amazing because the spicy tuna doesn't over power  the other ingredients like most places do. Def recommended.,1
3472,One of my favorite pizza places.  The location is understated as it is in a strip mall but it is not a reflection of the quality of food or atmosphere inside.  Great wood fired pizza and wine list.  Its a great place for a casual dinner with family or friends.,1
3473,"This place is the perfect man cave.\n\nTremendous selection in their large humidor, highly knowledgable staff, a smoking room with deep leather chairs and a big TV.\n\nBest of all, it's BYOB! My buddies and I have lately picked up beers at AJ's around the corner, brought them into the smoking room, lit some sticks and forgot about life for a while. I love Churchill's and will be coming back many more times.",1
3474,"Looks like I am one of the only ones who wasn't very impressed. Maybe I need to go back again and get something different?\n\nWe went for lunch and I was pretty excited after reading the reviews. The inside is clean and quaint. It is located in a shopping center (a little tough to find) but it is tucked in to the right of Staples.\n\nWe split two beef empanadas and the Bandeja Paisa which includes a mixture of egg, steak, sausage, an avocado cut in half, a sweet plantain, beans and rice. I really enjoyed the plantain but the rest was lacking a bit of flavor and wasn't very hot temperature-wise. I liked the steak once I added some of the side sauces to them but my chimichuri-loving husband said he thought it tasted jarred to him. \n\nMost dishes minus the lunch specials (4 which change daily) were about $12 for lunch. That is a little steep for me, the dishes are definitely shareable which is nice but it limited us to ordering what the other person would want too. For the price I just didn't feel like the meal lived up to some other $12 lunches I have enjoyed.",0
3475,"Meh. \nI was really excited to try this place out. I saw that they had ballpark pretzels so I was psyched! When we arrived there were no parking spots, so we had to go across the street to Safeway and walk over. Not that big of a deal. \n\nWe were seated right away. I liked that they had big booths and the picnic tables were fun. \n\nOur waitress couldn't have cared less that we were there. We even told her it was our first time there and she didn't even welcome us or tell us anything about the place. \nWe ordered the ballpark pretzel to start. I wasn't impressed with it at all. Its more bread like, very fluffy, not like a ballpark pretzel in the slightest. The cheese dipping sauce that came with it was underwhelming. Total bum out.\n\nOur meals came pretty quickly. I ordered the Chinese chicken salad, it was good. I liked the dressing and the fact that it was shaved chicken. I really liked the tortilla strips in it (though that's more like for a taco salad?) Overall it was a decent salad, they could use better quality lettuce in it, it seemed to be mostly iceberg. \n\nMy husband got the prime dip with a side of onion rings. He said the sandwich was just ok, not terrible but not memorable either. The onion rings were a joke. They had zero taste and honestly tasted like the onion rings that you buy in the freezer section of the grocery store. We each ate one and then he took the rings off his plate and set them off to the side. No one wanted to eat them. I actually asked the waitress if the onion rings were made FRESH, she said yes, I said really because they taste like they came out of the freezer, she said, welllll ummmmm ya I think they are frozen. NOT cool to lie to customers. \n\nMy mother in law got the fish and chips. The fish was actually pretty decent, I stole a bite. However, once again frozen run of the mil french fries and the coleslaw was not edible. \n\nWhen the bill came I noticed they charged us $1 for the horrible onion rings. I told my husband and when the waitress came back he asked her why. As I had said previously, we had told her it was our first time, when she asked him what side he wanted he said he didn't know what they were so she listed them off for him and did not tell us that the onion rings were a \""""premium\"""" side dish and were extra. Seriously it is only a $1 and we wouldn't have even made a deal out of it if they would have actually been edible. So we asked her if she could take the $1 off as they were terrible and we didnt eat them and we weren't even told they were extra. She sends the manager over, seriously. To take a $1 off. He told us he could take the $1 off or give us a free dessert. We went with the $1 off as we were all ready to get out of this place. He didnt even ask why.\n\nSo there you have it. Its a cool looking place, looks like they have a nice patio. The food is underwhelming. For 3 dinners, 2 beers and an app our bill was about $64. \n\nWould I go back here on my own? No. Would I go back here if some one asked me to join them? No.",0
3476,"You're strictly paying for the ambiance here. The decor is gorgeous. However, I found the food to be pretty blah, with the exception of the hot & sour soup. The soup was really good. Even with the spicy dishes that we ordered, we found the food to be bland. The chicken chow mein was particularly unimpressive. My local Chinese restaurant is leaps and bounds better than this place. I have no problem paying good money for a nice meal, however at $150 before tip for some mediocre Chinese food is insane. Do yourself a favor and skip this place. If you are in the mood for Japanese food, I highly recommend the teppanyaki at Shibuya located inside the MGM.",0
3477,This place is not good sushi and the prices don't reflect the service.  I went with 2 friends and the waitress made a huge deal about my friend returning her cucumber salad that looked a few days old.  Will not be going back.  Smith's on Valle Verde makes better rolls!,0
3478,"I wore a pair of their shoes for about 15 minutes this morning. After about 15 minutes, I decided to look at my foot to see why it hurt so badly. To my surprise, I saw that a piece of sharp plastic on the inside of the shoe had cut my foot open, and my foot and the shoe were bloody. When I took them back to the store, they refused to exchange them because I didn't have a receipt, even though they had the H&M label on the inside, and they were very lightly worn. So I won't be buying shoes there anymore, I guess... So now, an hour later, after I called their corporate office, they have decided to give me store credit...",0
3479,"Worst experience ever! I purchased 2 dresses via the Facebook page in July and had them sent to me in Canada. After receiving my package I realized Heather from the purple skirt sent me the wrong dress. She then sent me the correct dress but in the wrong size. arggghh So frustrating! At this point, my canadian summer is over and I asked for a refund. Heather confirmed she received the dresses and had processed my refund. Well that was a month ago and still no refund. Now my emails and phone calls are being ignored. I am in the process of doing a dispute through Visa. I am headed to Arizona next week with 6 girls who LOVE to shop. I will avoid this store like the plague. WORST SERVICE EVER!!!",0
3480,"Wow! So a friend introduced me to this place and I have to say, I'm quite impressed. \n\nMy first time there, after perusing the menu, I got a single \""""gyro burger\"""". It's as awesome as it sounds! My friend and I ordered two combos, a 6 pack of their awesome classic soda collection and some chili cheese fries. \n\nThe portions will fill ya'. \n\nThe owner is very friendly and quite helpful if you're new to the menu. \n\nI loved \""""Pop the Soda Shop\"""" and it moved all around AZ until, I guess they closed. I don't know if they merged or something, but they have everything they had there. All the sodas! \n\nI'm introducing another friend of mine to the place next week! I can't recommend  it enough!",1
3481,"This restaurant has been on my \""""to try\"""" list for awhile, so I was happy when friends asked to meet us here for lunch. It's a mixed bag, for sure, but some of what we tried was very good. I had the Chaud Chevre, which is a salad of greens, roasted red peppers and goat cheese tossed in their house dressing...I asked for it topped with salmon. The salad itself was very good, with fresh, crisp greens, great quality chevre and a nice tangy vinaigrette. They overcooked the salmon, but not to the point of dryness, so I didn't send it back. Next time I would ask for it medium rare. Doug had the mussels in curry, and this dish is terrific; mussels cooked perfectly in a delicious red curry, redolent of ginger. Usually when you order this dish at a French bistro the fries come with it, but they don't do that here, so Doug ordered up a batch. These fries would be great if they weren't so greasy, and the mayo that accompanied them was just too heavy, so these need work. One of our friends ordered the grilled cheese sandwich, and it was petite. I noticed, looking around the room, that other sandwiches were also small, so getting your money's worth can be an issue here, depending on what you order. They have a good selection of Belgian beers, which are listed under types. It would be nice if they described these types on the beer menu for novices; I imagine if you sit at the bar you'd get assistance from the bartender. It's also a tiny space with exposed brick walls and wood floors, so it gets noisy, and would probably not be a good choice for a first date. The food was good enough to get me back in, and I look forward to trying more of the menu.",1
3482,"I purchased the Travelzoo knowing darn well that tax and gratuity weren't included. WHAT I DID NOT EXPECT WAS A 20% TAX TO BE ADDED ON THE VALUE OF MY MEAL AUTOMATICALLY. Not knowing this I tipped another 20 bucks. No where on my voucher, menu, restaurant, website, waiter telling us did it clearly state that a 20% gratuity would be added ON ALL PURCHASES. Not only that it was based on the value of the meal which is arbitrary at best. I now noticed travelzoo has $410 dollar value voucher for $99 for almost the exact same thing.....well except instead of a $62 dollar tip on a $99 dollar meal they will get an $82 dollar tip on a $99 dollar meal. Food was sub par at best. My gf and I didn't even finish it all or want to take it home. BEWARE of this place. If you want somewhere nice in the Palms try ALIZE they are 10x better and a whole heck of a lot cheaper which is sad because they were a lot fancier than this place.",0
3483,"Lagasse's Stadium is a converted nightclub that is now a sports bar/book.  \n\nThere is a section with \""""theater style\"""" seating that is really nicely set-up, although upper rows are pretty far from screens.  The cost is $100 PER PERSON, for 3 hours.  The food is standard sports bar food, mostly deep fried options and burgers/steaks. \n\nFOOD\nUnimpressive and overpriced.\n\nAMBIENCE\nIt's fun to watch the games at a sports bar with people all decked out in their various jerseys, cheering when their team scores and groaning when they lose.  \n\nBe warned there are several tables that at are awkwardly laid out and have poor view of TV's or can only see one screen.\n\nCOST\nIt is WAY overpriced.  We only went because we had a coupon from the Venetian for 2 people.  \n\nOverall, I'd say go to one of the sports books and watch there.  I really like the one at the Wynn, where you can sit and have a drink and better food behind ZooZoo Crackers.  Although there is smoke from casino which is a bummer.",0

Wife got the Chilaquiles Verdes with chicken, while I had the carne asada burrito.  The carne asada beef was made really well.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nThey also serve Lux coffee which is very very good.

3486,"We first walked in and they are not so welcoming, but we had to explain that we wanted to eat here, duh!!!!! After we sat down, they wanted to take our order 3 times immediately when we hadnt finished reading the book menu. \nMenu looks good so we ordered 2 Pho with rare beef/meat balls/brisket and lemongrass sliced beef plate. All were delicious especially the broth of the soup.\nAfter dinner we ordered  2 Vietnamese coffee: sweet and satisfying.

3487,"After traveling for many years to a variety of hotels and locations, I found that the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas is by far the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at. The customer service is one of a fly by night setup. After booking four suites and staying there for four days, it never changed, but got worse as each day progressed. At check in the special request for our rooms were not done. We spent over 30 minutes trying to figure out why things were not accurate after booking each room weeks in advance. The rooms as mentioned by another review were substandard, and I was not impressed at all. On our third day we got harassed by the valet parking workers, and were accused of not being hotel guest. After a major scene was caused and lies were made, my car was then vandalized by them. I had left my car with the valet for less than 5 hours. They completely scratched off my tags and license plate. Although management was apologetic, it is very obvious that there is a lack in training, communication, and over all excellency in work ethic. I would never stay there again!",0
3488,"For all those griping about the tax subsidies for the light rail, Phoenix needed a light rail system, just like it needed I-10, 202, 51, and 101, and a big airport too; pretty much all paid for with our tax dollars. You paid for those extra lanes of congestion even if you never drive one of those roads. We all did. \n\nAre they all perfect and to everyones liking? Of course not. We're either a growing city or a dying one, so keep on expanding the system I say. \n\nI've enjoyed riding it when I can i think it's a source of pride for our city.  I give it four stars for the cool factor, of finally having a public transportation system that I would actually use. [Train vs. bus] I only hope the system will connect more shopping hubs, schools and the sports arenas in Glendale one day.",1
3489,"For a place open just a matter of weeks The Spot seems to be off to a great start.  We arrived to a full house on Saturday evening and settled onto some stools at the bar to enjoy a beer before a table was ready for us.  The bar selection was good and the bartender was enthusiastic and welcoming.\n\nBuilt within an old house, The Spot is small; there were only about 10 tables and about 4-6 spots at the bar.  Rumor has it there is some outdoor seating but it was a bit too chilly to take advantage of that!  They aren't currently taking reservations but who knows if that will change down the road.  The ambiance is quite nice; freshly done woodwork, soft lighting, and lined with black & white photos on the dark red walls.  If I had my choice, the best seats in the house are probably in the bar area or the booths up by the front windows.  Two of the booths are right by the kitchen window which has pros and cons; some people love \""""seeing behind the curtain\"""" and watching the action.  I, on the other hand, find fluorescent kitchen lights to be my kryptonite so I'd rather stick to the more romantic corners of the space.\n\nThe menu had many tempting options on it for both the vegetarian and the carnivore. Prices were reasonable and a lot sounded tasty.  We started with the Baked Artichoke Remikin ($6.50) which was served with pickled carrots and crusty bread.  We enjoyed it thoroughly; it was a good portion for two or three.  For entrees I had the Portabella stew ($11) which I enjoyed and the Mister settled on the Wild Boar Sausage ($14) and was also pleased.  Portions were fair sized, enough for dinner for each of us, not really enough to take home for lunch the next day.  Both entrees were served with a side of cooked greens and polenta.  The greens were good, the polenta was so salty even Mr.-High-Blood-Pressure himself wasn't interested.  \n\nThis is where The Spot's interest in customer service became evident: our server noticed both of us were bypassing the polenta & asked for feedback, which we provided.  He did say the kitchen team is still tweaking things and trying to improve everything, of course, so they appreciate hearing customer's thoughts on the food. (Well, you know we're not shy!).  We provided feedback on the polenta but assured him that overall they seem to be in great shape.  A few minutes later, the owner offered us a complimentary dessert due to the polentapalooza.  Yum!  Dense chocolate cake, rich and sweet, a perfect end to the meal.\n\nI liked the cozy space, it looks like they'll have some fun specials during the week, there were several things that tempted me on the menu, parking was easy, prices were reasonable, service was great... all in all, we look forward to heading back again.",1
3490,"My favorite place in town.  I started going there because I live close by.  The food is excellent - slightly creative pub style.  Excellent beer selection - rotating taps mean you'll always find something new.  Waitstaff seem to have been turning over a lot lately, which can lead to inconsistent service.  Usually good, though.",1
3491,"What a disappointment. Caesar's is the flagship casino for the Harrah's group so one would expect the buffet to be held to the same standard.  If you are looking for selection skip this buffet.

Great service and understanding of wine - what I LOVE is that Ian and his team take pride in not only having great knowledge of wine but hard to find bang for your buck good wine. They carry high end and they carry great every day priced wine. You can sample wines and they have weekly wine tastings. I also had them assist me with corporate christmas gifts and it was seamless.

The table we sat at last month was pealing all over the top and was  scratched up.   VERY DARK LIGHTING CAN'T COVER IT UP ANY LONGER!   I was embarrassed as we brought 2 couples who commented on it.    Also, with changes in management we had the worst service (first time we had bad service there in 8 years) we've ever had.   \n\nGet your act together 131 Main!  Don't rest on past success and renovate for the future!!!",0
3495,"I used to be a Palazzo Hotel guest regular until I discovered M Resort Hotel...c'mon free comp room..now how could anyone pass that up right?  =)  The Studio B buffet  is a great staple but really wanted to try Jayde Fuzion.  I watched a few episode of Food Network \""""Restaurant's Express and so that's how i knew of the Executive Chef for this restaurant. Of course it was a plus she was Korean...gotta support my peoples:)\n\nWe arrived right when they opened (5pm) so there was no wait! As i skimmed through the menu, i saw alot of authetic korean dishes in which was awesome. I was quite interested in seeing how they would execute the taste since I grew up with Korean food. The portions were smaller than i'm used to but the flavor of everything was superb! This is what we ordered:\n\nKorean Lobster-This dish reminded me of many chinese type dishes i've had in the past with the usual ginger and soy sauce base flavor but i love how they added a twist by making it korean, as it's name, by adding some korean pork, spices and veggies. There wasn't that much lobster pieces but in other restaurant dishes....they really isn't in the first place. I would definately eat this again...but maybe next time i'll order two for just myself..oink oink!\nPork Wrap-This was a fancy upgrade to what i'm used to, Samgyupsal (korean name for it). It tasted the similar but again with special additional ingredients.  Nice appetizer instead of just a salad. They give you four pieces. \nKalbi Rib-This was sweeter than the normal kalbi i'm used to. The beef quality was great but i wasn't really digging the extra sweetness. You can definately taste the kalbi that you usually eat but with a thicker teriyaki like sauce. I would've like them to have brought this out with white rice or something to neutralize the sweetness.\nKimchee Fried Rice-This was my absolute favorite of the dishes! OMG it's just like mom makes it but this extra spice/seasoning that kicks you to want more in your mouth. CRACK would be a better word. More please?!?!?!?!?\n\nSince it seems like they have mostly korean dishes, i wish the name and decor was more \""""korean\"""" themed though.They have the green for chinese and the cherry blossoms for japanese......Oh well maybe later if they ever remodel. =)",1
3496,"I had drinks here with a friend who is a local and recommended this lounge.\n\nThe ambiance is lovely! Posh and cozy couch areas. Glamorous strings of glittering beads hanging all around you. Attentive servers. And intriguing cocktails! \n\nThe price point is steep though. Their specialty cocktails ring in about $15 bucks each + tax and tip...that's a lot even for a San Franciscan used to ridiculous prices. But I suppose it's Vegas and the drinks really are delicious.  \n\nPay close attention to the base alcohol and unique ingredients listed on the menu so you can make sure you get a cocktail you really enjoy (bitters blegh). I ordered the Cat's Cradle to start off with something a little more sweet, fresh, and floral. And for my second drink I got more adventurous and ordered the spicy sweet and citrusy Dante's Inferno and it did not disappoint!",1
3497,"First and last time I order pizza from this place. I asked if they had fresh basil for the pizza. They young woman on the phone said they did and  added it to my toppings.  My pizza arrived on time but luke warm if that and no basil on the pizza and hardly any cheese.   I usually and I truly mean that do not complain about bad food or service but as a chef I thought they should know about my frustration.  A young man answered the phone this time and upon asking for a manager I was told that no one was available and that he could help me.  He proceeded to tell me that the basil was in the pizza sauce and had nothing to say about my cold pizza.  I was completely at a loss for words when I hung up the phone.  As a chef for over 20 years now, I know that one upset customer will tell many more people about their bad experiences versus their good.  Hence my decision to write this review.  I will never recommend this pizzeria to anyone.",0
3498,"I was in need of a couple of tires for a full size pick up truck....being in need of a bargin I surfed the web and came across these reviews and had to give Big Earl a try. Let me tell you......those before me who wrote reviews were not lying. I first called and Big Earl answered and took the time to look up my tire size where most places would have rushed me off the phone. He told me what he did and did not have and what options would fit my vehicle. Great customer service. I made my way over and can certainly say, this business man is worth giving a try. He provides the service most business have forgotten about.....quick, economical and friendly.",1
3499,"I wanted to take my grandma out for some dinner and since this place is a block or so from her house, we decided to give it a try. \n\nUpon arriving we could tell that it was busy, but there were still empty tables. We waited for 5 to 10 minutes to be seated and then another few for our waitress to take our drink orders (water, nothing from the bar). At this point I should have taken better notice of the patrons around us. Nobody had food in front of them and several tables looked anxious as if they had been waiting for some time. Our waitress returned to take our orders and then we started what would be the longest wait in restaurant history...\n\nWe literally waited for 35 minutes from the time we placed our order to the time we received our dinner salads. 'Oh good sign' I thought as we received our salads, thinking dinner couldn't be too far behind... well I was wrong. We sat and sat and sat for another 25 minutes. Eventually I told my hard of hearing grandma that I was going to settle up on our waters and side salads and we would go grab some Arby's. She agreed and I hunted down our waitress. When I told her I wanted to tab out, she looked at me with disbelief and stated she would have to get the manager. Then she proceeded to clean a table. I was disgusted and ready to go. And I would have too, if my sweet little grandma wasn't sitting there. Our waitress returned and asked if we could wait 2 more minutes. I looked around and mentioned there were at least 2 other tables ahead of us. She stated that they ordered pizza and it takes longer than our orders. A few more minutes passed and our plates came out. \n\nThe food was nothing fancy, but did taste alright. I had stuffed shells and grandma had manicotti. \n\nNext time I take grandma to dinner we will make the drive to another place and avoid the excessive waits.",0
3500,"Dos Reales was my favorite Mexican restaurant in the C-U area (as well as one of my favorite restaurants period) when I lived there a couple of years ago. This had a lot to do with the price point. Without fail, you can always get an entire meal at Dos for under $10. That is including drink and tip. What's even more amazing is the amount of food they give you for how little you pay. First, they start you out with free unlimited chips and salsa. Then, I would always chuckle to myself when they brought out my giant quesadilla I paid ~$3 for. I always felt like I was ripping them off...\n\nThe thing that really put this place over the top for me though was when we went there for a friend's birthday. They were incredibly nice and gave him a free margarita and tequila shot. Can't beat that!",1
3501,"I visited The Nest last night with a few friends, and would have to say I was rather impressed!  I love being scared, I'm obsessed with haunted ANYTHING, and Halloween is one of my favorite holidays.  With that being said, the last few years choices in haunted abodes have been lacking in the fright department.  But The Nest delivered more than a handful of jumps, scares and shrieks around each bend!  Even the ghouls and goblins that roamed the dusty streets while waiting in line were entertaining to watch, and made the 45 minute wait to get in seem to fly by fairly quickly.  The special effects were pretty decent, and the actors were VERY invested in being as spooky as possible.  I was actually cornered by two very creepy, very bloody escaped mental patients that refused to let me pass.  I had to duck, cover and roll (just about), just to get to the next room!  Scary for me, and entertaining for all the friends that went with me.  The cost ($25 pp, but on Sundays only $15pp if you buy a family 4-pack) was worth it.  The only downside is the distance from Old Town, but it's well worth it to venture outside The Bubble for a night of fright!",1
3502,"I like that they have two different menus. One more casual in the front (where we ate), and a fine dining option in the back. Our food was pretty good. I had two of the same drinks, and the first one was different than the second, which was weird for a manhattan. Overall, a good choice for a less spendy meal in Vegas.",1
3503,"I recently attended a class held by B&C (Tropicana location) on how to light portraits using Nikons and only off camera set ups. For the amount of money the company charged I was pleasantly surprised and blown away with what they offered. I'm a Canon user, but the Nikon expert (Paul Van Allen) explained everything in a way anyone could understand. Plus two beautiful, and endlessly patient, models posed for everyone in front of affordable off camera set ups that anyone can assemble in their home.\n\nIf B&C holds future classes in the same professional and easy-to-understand manner, I will definitely continue to attend.",1
3504,"Pizza has a great flavor and the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce has Great Flavor, only too little sauce!  If you see my photos you may say it looks like a lot!  The service here is always very good!  I have to say I'm a fan because I eat here more than any Italian place!",1
3505,"At 1 PM, we were handed large menus with several dozen interesting choices. Only one seafood entree (fish tacos) on the entire 4 pg card was less than $12, and that included soups. I didnt really want to settle for fish tacos in a lauded casa de mariscos.  \n\nEntrees come with complementary ceviche tostadas, which was a nice surprise.  My son had the house specialty,  camerones culuchi, and I tried a flash-fried whitefish, served whole with sides, for 15 bucks.  We agreed the green culuchi sauce bathing six shrimp was instantly forgettable. My fish had about 150 pin bones and less meat than a small can of tuna fish. That's not an attempt at humor. I can debone a fish and there was less meat on this crispy carcass than a standard 6 oz can of tuna, as if they extracted most of it for their own devices, leaving me with little more than skin, bones and an eyeball.  \n\nIt's hardly a crummy place on the inside - the decor is cute and colorful.  Service seemed friendly, if a bit confused, and having grown up in New England,  I'm aware seafood can be pricey.  That said, after tax and tip, we spent $40 for one meh and one pretty craptastic lunch, in a hole in the wall just south of Roosevelt. \n\nJudging from the other reviews, it sounds like we just came at a bad time, but that doesnt help me get my forty dollars back. Two stars for the ceviche.",0
3506,"Stop in most Saturdays while shopping. The use thigh meat for chicken katsu, which I love. \n\nService is quick and friendly. It is exactly what you'd expect from Hawaiian fast food. Food served in styrofoam, stripped but hearty and big portions.",1
3507,"WNW is a pretty fun place. My family and I have season passes now and we had them last year. Some improvements I have seen from last year to this year are:\n1. The lines are quicker, smoother, and shorter. We went on a Friday from 2 to 7 p.m. and I was surprised at how little we had to wait in each line. While last year the lifeguards would stand and watch you struggle your tube out of the rides and to the next person yourself, this year they quickly take your tube from you and give it to the next person so you don't have to...awesome! Love this.\n\n2. Faster pacing overall by the lifeguards in moving the lines along. For example, on the ride with the blue mat next to Canyon Cliffs, they now have numbers that the next riders up stand on behind each slide, eliminating a step for when it's your turn. \n\n3. The new Tornado is awesome!!!!\n\n4. I love that they have so many refillable food/drink items. Not only can you buy refillable drink bottles still, but you can now buy refillable ice cream dishes and icee cups for pretty reasonable prices.\n\nComplaints I Have:\n\n1. Lifeguards should wear watches or there should ve a clock we can see somewhere in the park. Wierd how lifeguards on duty don't even know what time it is when you ask them.\n\n2. The gift shop floor gets wet obviously so it becomes slippery and I even almost slipped and fell on it before. Although I did bring this up to a rude clerk as well as a manager last season, nothing has been done about it even to this day. A non-slip mat you'd think would be an easy solution.\n\n3. Slow food lines.\n\n4. Cold, gross food. The pizza is pretty okay though and the fries are okay if they're fresh.\n\n5. The water seems extra dirty...seems like they could have better filters.\n\n6. Last years gold and regular season passes both allowed you 6 free friend passes to bring a friend anytime you wanted. This year the gold pass only lets you bring a friend for free once a month and the regular pass allows you to bring a friend once a month for a fee of $15.....bummer. I loved last years friend benefits way more. Nonetheless, the seasin passes are pretty affordable since you gets your moneys worth with just two visits. I just wish our friends could come with us more.\n\n7. The customer service was horrible last year and it has only improved slightly. Many of the lifeguards seem to have careless teenager attitudes most of the time even when you just ask them a simple question.\n\n8. This new WNW just doesn't serm as big and excellent as the one we had here in Las Vegas when I was a kid...could be because everything seems bigger and better when you're a kid...not sure. \n\nEven though I do have a few complaints and WNW still has some room for improvement, I am still happy to have it back to give kids something to do in this very hot city. They really should have never taken it away.",1
3508,"Really enjoyed this show!  \n\nDon't expect her to sing or for you to see her face--for some reason (perhaps b/c she's not singing live) there's no jumbotrons for you to get close ups.  Show is exactly an hour and a half long, so it's perfect for still 'going out' afterwards. Ticket prices on Ticketmaster were reasonable, we paid $112 but like 3 months in advance; however,  on the day of the show they skyrocketed to almost $600 each.\n\nGreat way to start your night in Vegas especially if it's a 'girls trip'. She also redid some of her old songs to new melodies and they were pretty incredible.",1
3509,"I've been to Sushi Kame lots of times, and it's always a great experience.  I would definitely say it's my favorite sushi place in the area. \n\nThey start you out with a free cucumber and somen noodle salad.  It's small, but very appetizing.  I still can't figure out exactly what the dressing is, but I always drink the extra.  After that they give you a (also free) miso soup, which is pretty good as far as miso soup goes.    Oh, and the green tea is free and they use real matcha as far as I can tell.  It's got a really nice, light, floral taste.\n\nI've also been to Yellowfin a few times.  While Yellowfin is good, the reason that I like Sushi Kame more is probably their \""""American Sushi\"""" combo.  For about $14, you get three pieces of salmon nigiri, three tuna nigiri, a salmon roll, and the house salad, which is lettuce with ginger dressing.  The slabs of fish on the nigiri are nicely cut and usually pretty thick, giving the sushi a rice-to-fish ratio that definitely favors the fish.   Speaking of the fish, it has always been fresh and clean-tasting, never \""""fishy.\""""  Admittedly, I've only had non-midwest sushi once, so my basis for comparison is only other sushi in Illinois.  \n\nWhen it comes to maki, I usually stick with the simpler stuff that lets you taste the fish more, so I can't offer much of an opinion on the super tempura fried california rolls or whatever.  The unagi rolls are good though.\n\nI've had the sea urchin here as well, and while it's softer than the stuff at Yellowfin, there's also more of it and it tastes really, really good.",1
3510,"Cold French Toast. When mentioned to the waitress she brought back to the kitchen. She came back to tell me that the kitchen was making me a new batch. She came back with the new batch which had the same corner removed that I cut originally to find out that the toast was cold. Ok, it did come back hot (for at least 5 minutes). Toast was dry and tasteless. My daughter who is a IHOP aficionado told me that the French Toast at the IHOP in San Jose, CA is better, but believe me I am not running to find out.",0
3511,"An initial good sign of any business is proper, friendly and enthusiastic phone answering skills. Budget delivered.

We tried ourselves and those little decals bubbled more than a flapjack on a hot griddle in Atlanta in Julyyyy! I've never been to Atlanta or referred to pancakes as flapjacks. Something I just channeled so it seems. The work, by Jeremy was excellent. The follow up by Joe and his wife, visiting my establishment was unsurpassed. And greatly appreciated.

3512,"Great hospital the nurses were the best.  Our daughter was born here recently and we have no complaints.  I do wish the Mongolian BBQ that is offered in the cafeteria was better though.  It was prepared with the thinnest single slice of lunch meat chicken and then after a few bites I found it so unappetizing that I just threw it away.  But you don't go to a hospital for the food, and that's why I rate it five stars.",1
3513,"My husband and I dine at Icon's occasionally primarily for happy hour.  On yesterday, we were surprised to arrive and be advised that the restaurant no longer has happy hour. In addition, the hostess was less than welcoming.  The place was virtually empty when we requested to be seated. She proceeded to respond with I need to make sure we don't have reservations at this time. The chicken empanadas are one of our favorites, but when we got them this time they had shrunk in size.  Again the place was empty when we were seated, and wasn't full when we left.  Bad service combined with downsizing food= we will not be returning.  There are much better restaurants in Madison who have great service and great food. Deuces!",0
3514,"WOW this place is one of the coolest time warps around! I can't believe I never knew about it!\n\nAs Norm R. said, this is part of William Bartlett's ranch dating back to 1886 with many original restored structures, some are brick and wood and one is stucco, and they all have that wonderful weathered old look to them that just makes you wonder \""""if these walls could speak, what stories would they tell?\"""" \n\nYou can peek inside the buildings and see the furniture, tools and stuff they used during the pioneer days and get a sense of what life was like in Old West Arizona. \n\nYou can also wander around the property and look at and even touch (but no climbing please!) lots of cool rusty old farm machinery, wagons and equipment, and wonder about what it was used for. \n\nI also saw: a blacksmith shop, a reproduction of a well building that would have been used in the 1920's, something that looked like a locomotive engine, a dairy barn, a cornfield, a citrus orchard, grapevines, a rose garden, peacocks, rooster chasing a hen, the cutest white bunny I've ever seen in my life, and 7 beautiful princesses in ball gowns and tiaras posing for quincenera pictures.\n\nAll around the property are educational signs with info and photos about the original ranch and what life was like from the 1890's thru the 1930's (when the ranch was at the peak of production).\n\nI didn't get a chance to take a tour, but I think that would be an excellent idea! The website says that tours are held Thursdays thru Saturdays, 10 AM - 2 PM, and Sundays 1 - 4 PM.\n\nI saw a sign that says you can even rent parts of the property for special events. (I gotta save up for a major shindig now!)\n\nIt's the perfect spot for an afternoon stroll when it isn't unbearably hot, and there are tons of park benches where you can just rest and relax. If you have kids they will be super happy to see all the cool stuff and run around after the peacocks. Just don't let them climb all over everything or lose them in the cornfield, and you'll be good. \n\nSo, so glad this wonderful slice of Glendale's history has been preserved.\n\nAnd admission is FREE!",1

I called my dad who is a postal worker and said that ask if we can just \""""black out\"""" the priority mail part on the box and we asked them and they said yes.

3521,"Girl Talk was performing at the outdoor Boulevard Pool area the night I came to The Cosmo. It was a freaking awesome concert, even though it was windy and cold as hell outside. One thing I really like about this hotel is that they have a giant LED screen outside the hotel that shows you all the main events going on live and Girl Talk was no exception.\n\nThe entire hotel is VERY swanky and has so much art and other cool stuff to stupidly gawk at (ie: the three story Chandelier Bar which is made with $30 million worth of real crystals. No wonder everybody complains about Vegas' economy-maybe you shouldn't spend that much building a bar lol). The location is also very awesome. My only gripe is that this place is definitely way out of my budget (probably to help pay for that bar haha). Good luck trying to find a table for less than $50 on the weekends.\n\nHowever, when I become a millionaire, you better believe I'll be hanging out with the equally swanky 20 something-year-old glamour gods and goddesses the hotel tries to cater to.",1

It was pretty dead and the waitress was nice enough but completely forgot our appetizer, which we had to ask to have removed from our bill (we figured we wouldn't bother with it since we had already been served our entrees). I got the Singapore noodles with chicken and was incredibly disappointed. It was disgustingly salty, even after drenching it in Siracha I still couldn't eat it. My fiance got the Teppanyaki beef and yakisoba which was not in fact yakisoba (yea, I know the difference). Not every Asian noodle is the same people! He could at least stomach his meal.

3534,"I went here with my husband on a friday. Less than half capacity and seated ourselves. After seating we waited about 10 minutes to place our order. Our drinks were served after another 5 minutes and we waited and waited for our pancakes... more than 25 minutes. Once the food arrived we were so excited to dig into our meals. I noticed the nice scoop of softly melting butter onto of my  banana waffle and it actually looked so fluffy and light I tasted a small bit to be sure it wasn't whip cream. My mouth was greeted by a small, but overwhelmingly crucial detail....they used salted butter. Not just lightly salted butter....this was REALLY salty butter. I quickly try to scrape as much butter off the pancake, but alas, it had mostly already soaked into the waffle. Even after pouring more than a comfortable amount of maple syrup onto the waffle it was so salty. I tried to move on to the bacon instead and then I really got upset. THEY SALTED THE BACON TOO!!!!  Who does that?!?! It was inedible, but even a little bit made my mouth dry. I asked my husband about his meal and he had the same problem. Salty pancakes.  So, terrible food and lackluster service make this a no-go in my book. Sorry, wanted to like it. Just didn't happen.",0
3535,"Desperately want to like this restaurant since it's in my neighborhood. We have given up on it and tried again and again for years. Food is mediocre and the service (with sporadic exceptions) is terrible. Clearly management does not care or cannot get its act together. Thursday evening it took 20 minutes to get two sodas because they were \""""out of clean cups.\"""" We were still charged for those sodas. There was a good crowd that night but also many employees walking around. They likely needed more direction. None of our visits here have included the manager stopping by the table to ask how our meal was going. I wonder why? Perhaps, there is no one managing this operation.",0
3536,"I have been to Texas de Brazil probably 6 times since living in Vegas, and do not get tired of it.\n\nThe ambience, the salad bar with its gourmet cheeses and meats, the Lobster Bisque all are worth going for, but the meats are what keep me coming back.  \n\nDo not be sidetracked by the chicken, pork, or lamb they bring around.  Hold out for the good stuff!!  The house sirloin, the filet mignon and the flank steak are the three best choices.  Eat them repeatedly.  Savor each bite.

We ordered some beers and waters along with appetizer..fried pickles yummy. We got our drinks but no appetizers.  So in the meantime we ordered our food. Mind you our waiter was great however the food service was extremely slow. We built our own burgers and all but one person ordered med-well and the other well done. We figured since she orderd hers well that what was taking so long. We go out food and but into a raw mooing burgers.  My husband isn't one to cause a scene about returning food so we just ate what we could and prayed we didn't throw it up later. I wasn't happy at all. The 2 stars are for the server.,0

But some things I can't seem to overlook and it doesn't help that a manager failed to even reach out to me after I contacted one about my concerns. \nThe issues are BUGS. Bugs everywhere. Bugs in the rice aisle, even visibly seen in some of the rice bags. Bugs found baked into the french bread. It's gross and kind of unsettling. I know bugs can happen even in the best of circumstances (and kitchens) but it's been one of those things that continues to be an issue.",0

3547,"My boyfriend and I came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon and waited for about 45 minutes before being seated. The wait was definitely doable, especially since the hostess takes your phone number and online updates are texted to you informing you how many parties are ahead of you. Once we were seated, our server was quick to take our orders and make us feel welcome. I ordered the LV burger and my boyfriend ordered the ABC burger - both were delicious. Finally, we had our frozen hot chocolate, and this treat alone made the high prices tolerable. This was definitely an awesome experience and is a must-do for people visiting Vegas.",1
3548,"ate there recently for dinner, it was wonderful. i ordered the goat curry and was excited to try goat for the first time right after i found out it is the most consumed meat on earth outside of the US BUT the table of 12 Indian gentleman behind us had ordered it all....which led me to believe these guys know what they are doing. instead i tried the lamb and it was perfect. i really liked the candor of our waiter \""""andrew\"""", which was not his name but he called himself that with a grinning smirk; i told him i had ordered kingfisher lagers before and would love to try another beer since they had a few indian beers, he told me to stay with the kingfisher. also, once he told me the goat curry wasn't available i ordered tandoori lamb, he assured me it was good but encouraged me to try the curried lamb since i originally ordered goat curry. my ladyfriend ordered a veggie dish and loved it, we got some bread as well, she ordered some REASONABLY (which is becoming more rare these days) priced wine. all in all the food was very good and the service was near perfect, i like when a waiter can read what you are looking for, makes reco's on that judgment and nails them. i will be going back to maharani frequently for both the food and smiling faces that provide you perfect service.",1

These shortribs are excellent.  I'm a huge onion soup fan, and this is one of my favorites that are readily available.  You can surely tell that the broth isn't quickly assembled, and has been layered and simmering for some time.

At last check they still don't even want to participate for a letter grade and seems to have a consistent stream of mildly concerning health issues. \n\nBeing a veg place I figured, that even a few health issues can't kill me, at worst I would get some good quality time with a book so we gave it a try.\n\nWe started with the Gobi manchurian, It is listed under dishes but it works best as an appetizer. This dish is great and their execution worked quite well. We had a massive dosa which was great with the many dipping sauces. We also had a vegetable vindaloo that was forgettable. \n\nOver all the food was good and no one got sick. Prices are on part with any sit down indian place.  The ambiance is a bit odd",1

I stand there looking at the menu, but have to wait for the worker guy to finish flirting with the girl at the counter before I can give my order. \n\nI ordered the combo that contains 1 fish, 4 shrimp, fries and a drink. I'm sitting at the table reading my book with my earphones in waiting for my food, because they said they would bring it to my table. So it's been a while and I turn around to look back at the place and they are standing in the window with my food. Boo. \n\nThe only condiments that came with my food were some sauces that was very thin, kinda like a hot sauce? But not real hot. No condiments anywhere else and no one at the window anymore. So I sit down to eat. These are shrimp? Really? I couldn't tell with all the breading. They taste like nothing. Literally, they have no flavor at all. The fish was ok, but way overcooked. It was pretty dark. The fries were good, the only thing in the meal worth anything. Oh, and the Dr. Pepper was good, but it's hard to mess up the Nectar of the Gods! \n\nI ended throwing away half my food which I NEVER do (and if you've seen me, you know).

3560,"This is definitely the kind of place where you drink pints, wearing tracksuit bottoms, on the days when you can't be bothered to put makeup on. It's certainly not a white wine spritzer or cosmo sort of place.\n\nWhat's great about this place is how cheap it is. As part of the Scream Pubs family you get drinks prices starting from as little as \u00a31.80, and if you're hungry then \u00a34-5 will ensure you leave with a full tummy. There are two pool tables too, although they are quite close together which means you usually end up on both the giving and receiving end of a pool cue in the back every few minutes at least.\n\nIn the downstairs section there are also loads of tv screens for watching sport, although the awful music they play will definitely make you wish you'd stayed at home to watch the footy in your own living room: the jukebox is programmed to always play the songs that are least selected, i.e. the really awful ones that no-one ever pays for, to make people put money into it to do everyone a favour and change the track.\n\nAnd there are lots of other things that may well put you off coming here. For starters, given that it's underground means it's dark, dingy and generally a bit depressing. Add to this the fact that this place hasn't seen a refurb in far too long, and you end up with a combination of dark and dreary mixed with shabby and grubby.\n\nBut the very worst thing about here is the state of the loos. Without wanting to sound high maintenance, I like my toilets to have a) loo roll and b) a lock on the door. But when you've spent so long queueing for one of the only 3 loos (one of which will usually be out of order) you tend to just put up with it!",0

Do you really need that much security? Eh, to be fair, I did witness some drama go down. \n\nI would hate to live in a world where I subscribed to the thought that Axis/Radius is THE hippest nightlife destination in the Phoenix metro area.

They took the grills off and brushes that but didn't brush out the vents at all. It is not a 300$ value in our opinion. We could have stuck a vacuum in ourselves. That's all they did.\n\nThis entire process has been ridiculously difficult and we are incredibly unhappy so we won't be using their services in the future. The Amazon deal was to pay $50 for a $298 service.\n\nFirst of all I was able to make the appointment with someone (that said eco air?)  but someone else called me multiple times only once leaving me a message - in that message stating I could not have the appointment (5 days before my appointment that I made 3 weeks prior). I confirmed with the guy from the email that my appointment with still on yet I received multiple phone calls after that. I finally called back not knowing who us air was and they told me that the technician could not come out between the scheduled time and did not have any other options really for me that were convenient. I also did not appreciate the way I was asked why someone wouldn't be around at 3 p.m. In the afternoon to which I replied that most people are working during that time.\n\nI told the girl that I would call her back and asked my fiance to call because I needed to get back to work.

Today we received  a phone call from the technician stating that he could be on his way in 20 minutes and it was 230 in the afternoon. \nAfter they arrived they asked about the voucher and stated that it was only a $50 voucher and therefore there were certain services they would not do. I told my fiance that the voucher was $50 yes but the value was 298 dollars.\n\nSo after the ridiculous scheduling debacle I guess I shouldn't be surprised they didn't really know what they were supposed to be doing when they came to my house. They also for some reason plugged into an extension cord I had and almost immediately blew the circuit.\n\nThey ONLY vacuumed and brushes the vents - a $50 service according to the tech. He kept saying we only paid $50 so that was all we were getting. Which is funny, because it was worth $298. REALLY? So - I guess we got what we paid for.

I know many tape labels that use this same unit, and told him so. Then he told me that the parts I needed may not be able to be found.

I repeated my demand, got the bag, exchanged insults, and left.\n\nThen I realize he didn't give me the power cable for the unit.\n\nI called back and demanded it, but his reply was to say that I forgot it, and that he wouldn't return it. I threatened police involvement, but was told that he had already contacted the police to file a harassment suit.\n\nI almost went in the store to confront them, but decided to be proactive and call the cops myself.\n\nNeedless to say, I got my power cable back.

The only downside is how crowded it can get and how unfriendly folks can be while driving in a cramped parking lot. During the holidays, they have cones and whatnot out to direct traffic, but I think they should keep them year round because some drivers are out of control! \n\nOther than that, it's a great place for any time of day since they've got you covered for breakfast, lunch or dinner.

3576,"The Porch was a welcomed addition to the space near the Cathedral of Learning for going out after academic talks or taking visiting scholars to a nice lunch in a good-looking place nearby. The food was good enough although limited (as many other reviewers have pointed out), and the drinks are excellent and they have a variety of beers available. \n\nThis place has gone downhill since it first opened, however -- particularly the service. I have only had one server in this place do even a halfway decent job, and I think he was actually a dishwasher or cook filling in for a server during a desolate lunch shift. Every other time, the server takes upwards of 20 minutes to bring drinks, it's like pulling teeth to get a pitcher of water delivered to the table, and forget about asking for refills or silverware or condiments -- they'll stop by the table and only take one person's request, then disappear for another 20 minutes, after which you'll need to remind them of your request. \n\nThe most disappointing thing happened just yesterday, when one server who was working a dinner/happy hour service announced that she was sick with the flu that's been going around as she delivered my colleague's salad to the table. I feel bad for the woman for being sick and working through it, of course, but perhaps management should allow their sick employees to take nights off so they don't feel the need to announce their misery to their customers. \n\nIn short, the service in this place is so bad that the food doesn't even make it worth going. However, it remains the closest and most viable option for many academics in the area, and I think that is the sole reason this place will continue to survive.",0
3577,"The Burger Joint has a lot going for it.  It is easy to find, not typically too crowded and the food is good.  Friend #1 had a &7 order of chili cheese fries (a staple of the drunk food group) that could've fed a family of 4.  Friend #2 went rogue and ordered a carnitas burger which featured a hunk of delicious fried cheese.  Now if *that* isn't burger genius then I don't know what is.  Wifey ordered the Waygu burger, an although she wasn't singing its praises, she wolfed it down.\n\nI recommend assembling your own burger alacarte and then decimating it while making \""""num-num\"""" noises.",1
3578,"Favorite pizzeria in Phoenix!  I always bring out of town friends here and they fall in love with it. My cousin drives up from Tucson to get an LGO fix way more often than she would probably care to admit.  =)  \n\nI've tried probably every pizza on the menu.  My absolute favorite is the roasted corn pizza with sausage added.  I have some leftovers in my fridge as I write this, in fact.  Mmmm!   That pizza just blows my mind every single time I order it!   The classic margherita pizza is always a hit too, it's just so fresh and made to perfection.  Order the roasted corn - add sausage if you're a meat eater and enjoy this little slice of heaven! \n\nIf you're thinking about an appetizer, you can't go wrong with the chip plate - the pimento dip is amazing - it just tastes like a cheese dip with a little kick/heat to it.  The guacamole is always so fresh and delicious too.  A favorite spot for guac.  I don't personally care for the salsa though, but I'm happy to leave that to others and go for the guacamole and pimento dip!  \n\nStop by at the market for some delicious dessert on your way out.  Vegan apple cinnamon cookie is surprisingly great. The sea salt chocolate chip cookie can't be beaten.  Or get yourself some gelato or a cupcake, you can't go wrong.  \n\nEveryone will enjoy your meal here.  It's one of my favorite treats and how I love to show off Phoenix to visiting friends!   Great job LGO!!",1
3579,"I have been a member of Mountainside for a little over a year now. I love the location! Its halfway between my house and work, which is perfect for me! I also love how all the cardio equipment has a TV on it! It makes the pain and little less! I feel like they are really clean and everything is up-to-date!\n\nThe down side is that they are really expensive. I wish they had a pool to make everything worth while! I also wish they would leave the towels in the bathroom. Its a pain they keep them up front. Why do they even do that anyways? Also, my main concern is the times they have for their classes. I wish they would have a yoga, cycle or fitness class in the afternoon! All they have is from 9-10 to 4-6. Would it really be that hard to have a class twice a week between 12-3??",1
3580,"Went there last night for dinner with a group of girls.  When I walked in, I felt like I walked into a crappy Vegas lobby/restaurant.  Clientele was what was expected & typical for that part of Scottsdale - at the bar were a bunch of \""""brah's\"""" who like to act like they have money and their respective female counterparts.  Restaurant area was slightly older crowd - especially with the waitstaff, which I thought was unfortunate.  I expected the server to be a hot babe...girl or guy.  Instead, it was a 50-something-year-old woman with no social skills.\nThe food was also pretty gnarly.  We ordered probably 6 or 7 appetizers before we ordered meals.  I only tried a couple of them - specifically the \""""warm maytag blue cheese fondue\"""" with potato chips.  ICK.  The dip was horrendous tasting and looked like what my husband calls a \""""wax dart\"""" if he hasn't, you know, for a while.  The chips were really greasy and just tasted like a potato dipped in oil.  I also tried the \""""oven roasted tomato and goat cheese casserole\"""" with herb toast.  Another ick.  The toast was alright, but the casserole was like bruschetta gone wrong.  I ordered the \""""Grilled Chicken Piccata\"""" with the butter sauce on the side.  It was alright - way too much salt and the seasonings tasted off.   \nI don't know, perhaps I went there with the wrong expectations.  I thought the atmosphere wouldn't be as cheesy and I expected to eat \""""comfort food\"""", not food I wanted to secretly spit into my napkin.  I'll never go back.",0
3581,"My mom and I went to this location for a morning smoothie. I remembered seeing a groupon available and I bought it waiting in line to order for 5 for $15. When I ordered the cashier rudely told us they don't participate in Groupon's and offered no apology. On the door is a whole letter explaining they aren't accepting Groupon's. They need a sign simply stating \""""Groupon's Not Accepted\"""" because who is really going to read an entire letter while walking in? We spend over $17 for 3 smoothies. Plus the $15 for the Groupon. Of all the locations in the valley only 4 aren't accepting them.

3582,"Let's be honest. Last Chance is not a place to take your date, your parents, or anyone else you're trying to show a good time. Yes, there are shoes and shirts strewn about - there are hundreds of pre-menopausal women clawing through the doors each day. No, the people there aren't always friendly - they're not trying to earn a tip from you...they're on a mission to clean up the 38,039 pairs of shoes and shirts left strewn about by said pre-menopausal women. Yes, there may be a line to the dressing room a dozen people long. Yes, there may be a checkout line 3 times longer than the dressing room line. *This isn't the place to linger with friends and admire the latest fashion - this is for die-hard bargain shoppers only.*\n\nAs far as the actual clothing goes, it's hit or miss. I've gone there many times without finding anything, but I've also left with $500 worth of clothing I paid less than $50 for. IMPORTANT: Carefully inspect everything before you buy it. Everything is sold as is, and there are no returns or exchanges - no exceptions.\n\nBest advice? Get in, and get out. Best times are weekday mornings, though the last time I came I unexpectedly timed it just right when I thought it would be awful. I came in the early evening on a weekday, around 5:00. I had to wait over 10 minutes for a dressing room (it would have been much longer if I hadn't taken the open changing area), but once I was out there was no checkout line. The store was packed full of people, but it seemed that everyone had just arrived and wasn't ready to check out yet. If you can avoid it, DO NOT WAIT UNTIL LAST CHANCE CLOSES TO LEAVE. They will not let you keep looking around once 9pm hits, and you may have to wait in the checkout line for 30 minutes while the dozens of people in the store are pushed together all at once.\n\nKnow that everything is hit or miss at Last Chance. Some people are friendly and helpful, and some are not. Sometimes the lines are horrible, and sometimes they're quick. Sometimes you'll find incredible deals on beautiful clothing, and sometimes you won't.",0

We were started off with drinks by a male server,didn't catch his name but he had gauges I believe. Then Rachelle I believe her name was took over. Ordered our food,2 pizzas and a dip.

They have drink AND food runners,so there's no excuse for neglect anyways). \n\nEither way,each time she touched the table she didn't ask how the food was,If we needed anything else,wanted another beer(s). At the end of our time there we asked for a doggie bag.

3594,"Ate here after looking at all the choices in the Mekong Plaza.  Tried their combination menu which included Egg Drop soup, spring roll,  fried nice and the the dish of your choice.  The soups came out and after two spoonfuls  I decided it was not worth eating due to the \""""unusual\"""" taste and perhaps a bit of sourness such as when food is going bad.  I was afraid to eat it and gave it up quickly.  My hubby ate perhaps two more spoonfuls than I  (his palate is not as quick as mine) and then gave up on the soup.  He loves egg drop soup so for him NOT to eat it, you know something was wrong with it.  I mentioned to the server that something was really wrong with the soup--that it tasted funny and she gave me a half smile and walked away.  Didn't even take the soups away from the table until I visually prompted her to.  Perhaps not knowing enough English is the problem--probably.  \nThe spring roll was tasty as was the colorless \""""fried rice\"""".  Yes, although it was white with some peas in it, it did have a pleasant taste.  The pork chow mein I had was almost all noodle with just specks of pork.  Pork is cheap isn't it?  I don't get why there wasn't much of it.   Hubby's orange chicken was made as spicy as he requested and was not laden with crust--he really liked it.  \nIt took a lot of coaxing to get the water glasses filled especially since it was a really hot afternoon.  \nAfter my first time here, I think that the food is OK and the prices are fair.  However,  I don't think I will go out of my way to eat here again---especially after the bad Egg Drop Soup (which I believe had the potential to make me sick)  and lack of pork in my dish.",0

Eventually, he settled on, \""""gel powder okay?\"""" Gel powder is NOT gel. I knew that, but I was sick of arguing, and accepted it.\n\nHe did not ask me if I wanted rounded or flat tips. When he started making them flat and I said I wanted round tips, he said, \""""okay, last, afterwards,\"""" so I figured he'd round them all at once. Nope. He left them flat. When it became apparent that's what he was doing, I tried saying again that I wanted round tips, and again I was met with an answer that implied he'd fix them at the end. When he declared me done and sent me to the dryer, I said one last time that I had asked him for rounded tips, which he IGNORED!!! And just walked away!\n\nOn top of the absolutely horrible service and failure to listen to me OR explain why I couldn't get gels (something I've never had a problem with anywhere before), the nail job itself was absolutely horrendous! They were crooked, half of them COVER my cuticles, and far too bulky. I measured; each nail is almost 3 millimeters thick. Go find a measuring tape and see how thick 3 millimeters is. It's like having clogs strapped to my fingertips.\n\nMaybe their other nail technicians are better; maybe their pedis are amazing. I wouldn't know, and I'm never finding out. Be sure to steer clear if you're looking for fake nails. AWFUL!",0
3612,"Glad that we found a place with an atmosphere reminiscent of our Blind Onion at home. MM has an excellent beer selection, which is great for self proclaimed beer snobs like my BF and  I. For the life of me, I cannot figure out how someone would drink a Girl's Light when there are so many more fantastic tasty beers available! But I digress....So far the only pizza we tried has been the buffalo chicken. I didn't expect it to be good, but it was! Fresh ingredients are clearly obvious. The only draw back is that it is a bit on the pricey side, but I am definitly up to try more of their menu.",1
3613,"Okay.   Tonight marks the last time I go to this Wal-Mart.\n\nI went with the intention of buying some sort of Tablet.  When I got to the section, a gentleman was being taken care of by Lauren.  They were in the middle of getting a GPS ( I think) so I decided to go down the isle and look at antennas and do a quick turn around.  On my way back, a lady walked up and explained that her GPS didn't work in Canada.  Lauren didnt have an answer for her (understandable) and the woman said that she had some other questions when she was finished.  Lauren got the man's item out of the case and away the three went.\n\nI stood there for a good 5 minutes waiting for her to come back.  No Lauren.  She ended up coming over close to where I was and proceeded to get out locking cases from a cabinet.  She stood up and looked at me and gave me this weird look and I said, \""""Will you help me?\""""  As we were getting out 1 tablet at a time, she kept hold of the boxes like I was going to run off with them.  Really?\n\nLauren should have been taught how to take care of one customer at a time and acknowledge others who are waiting.

3617,"Sushi Samba was the perfect spot to fill up on tasty food after a quick shopping spree at The Shoppes at The Palazzo with my fashionista girlfriend. We went straight for the $16 Chilean seabass bento box, which was the best deal on the lunch menu. It came with miso soup, field green salad, tuna roll and oshinko pickles. \n\nThe three skewers of miso glazed seabass, along with all the sides, was a nice amount of food (though could've been a little small for a big appetite), but I seriously could have eaten three more skewers. The seabass was amazing! That miso marinade was to die for. I suppose I could've gotten the entree portion, but for lunch, it was perfect. Plus, $29 is a bit much to spend on a lunch entree. There were six tuna rolls, so that also made the bento filling.\n\nThe funky decor was really cool, and reminded me a little of Blowfish in the bay area -- but much bigger and with Latin influences intertwined. The staff was awesome, and the food came out quick. We were in and out in a flash, and back to the pool before our guys even missed us.",1
3618,"Glaziers is hands down the best grocery store in Vegas.

The place was featured on extreme couponing and recently had a BOGO on excellent already nicely priced cheeses that caused me to buy the max on consecutive days. Sh*ts cheap yo.\n\nAlso the produce here all appears to be sculpted out of wax. It's amazing. Most of the fruits and vegetables have cut open \""""displays\"""" so you can see the grade of what you're buying. They have fruits here I've never seen before that make star fruits seem tame.

3621,"Wanting to try a new popcorn place since my favorite \""""Popcorn Girl\"""" is further from my house, I tried this out. \n\nIn comparison, the popcorn is much lighter than Popcorn Girl and more subtle. Not sure if that's good or bad, depending on your preference but I do tend to feel a little less guilty eating this. It appears it's been lightly seasoned vs the other which seems covered in butter and seasonings-but who knows the real ingredients at each place. \n\nWhat bothered me was the worker. She was nice as can be letting me try whatever I wanted and was giving me her opinion on flavors, which was appreciated.  Whenever I tried one flavor, she stuck her hand inside the bucket bare hands and all, no gloves, no scooper and grabbed a few pieces and ate it while I ate my sample and when I asked her questions she had food in her mouth, I almost felt like I had to wait for her to finish chewing and swallowing before asking for another sample. She must have done this with 5 plus different flavors. Mind you, when I first walked in she did not wash her hands (like how they do at Subway or Golden Spoon, you actually see the employee wash their hands in front of you). I saw the sink, but no hand wash. I wouldn't mind the no hand wash if she had gloves, but to stick her bare hands in the tub of popcorn and munch on popcorn seemed inappropriate and unsanitary. \n\nIf you like Dole Whip, theirs tastes like the real thing but the amount you get for $2.50 is about 5 bites maybe 6? It's small.",0

3624,"So you would think this place has it down when it comes to large parties because the only time I have ever come here (and have seen many times) is for large get togethers.  Well, they came sort of close...\n\nI have worked in a restaurant as a server, so I always try to give the server the benefit of the doubt.  I know that it is extremely stressful serving large parties, takes much longer, and can generally stress you out.  Our server appeared to be finishing up with a very large party of about 20 women when he started with us.  Ok, I'll give him that.. it took quite some time between the time we sat to the time we ordered drinks, got our drinks, and then placed our food order (about 20 minutes).  It took another 30 minutes before our table got our salads/soups... and then ANOTHER 30-40 minutres after soups/salads were served until we got our food.  By the time we got our food, we were tired, not that hungry, and a little irritated.  Plus, I don't think the food is worth THAT long of wait.\n\nTo rate the food/drinks:\n-Mom said her martini was just OK... should have been served more chilled.\n-salads were heavy on the dressing, but good.\n-Main dishes were good, good quality food... but side of angel hair pasta dishes were too dry.\n\nOur server did apologize stating that there were many other problems tonight in the kitchen, hence the long wait.. but who knows if that is true (I may or may not have used that line a time or two as a server...) And he did redeem for the long wait by providing us 2 free desserts to take home (cheesecake was yum!)\n\nI guess my biggest complaint, while also trying to be understanding of the fact that this place is so insanely busy, was the general attitude I felt from the staff we interacted with.  From the hostess to the manager helping the hostess to the server... I felt as a server, they were not emitting the kind of welcoming attitude that should be given at a restaurant.  Yes, I know it is jam-packed in your restaurant and people are probably complaining up the wahzoo about waiting for a table.  But the experience the staff creates for a restaurant is usually what gets me wanting to come back!\n\nAnother tip--be prepared to talk loudly when you go.. it is very noisy!  And dark.",0

3628,"Breadfruit is the truth.  \n\nThis is corroborated by the fact that Exhibit A, i.e, the Jerk Chicken will make you a believer in a deity, be it God, Buddha, Allah, Brahman, Akal Purakh, Zeus, or Marley.\n\nThe bird is marinated in hot and spicy seasonings and finished to perfection on the grill.  It remained tender and juicy throughout, except for the masterfully charred ends that added a slight smokiness to the entire dish.  \n\nBut lets back up a second.\n\nThe space itself is brilliant in its simplicity.  The walls are lime and slate gray with classy darkwood furniture.  The glassed walls look out onto the stoic skyline of downtown Phoenix and onto the hidden pave of Pierce, an homage to side-street gems that one would find in cities like NY, SF, and Seattle. \n\nIt is comfortable and cozy inside, with exposure to the cuisine sharks tending the kitchen.  At all times, there is activity, but just enough so that you feel the life of the kitchen spill out onto the dining area.  I love restaurants that pull this off.\n\nFor an app, we started with an order of the Curry Chicken Patty.  It was sensational.  Within the pastry was a harmonious balance of chicken to curry with a noticeable, but slight burn throughout.  Two came in an order, which must be shared with a partner because two pre-meal would fill you up too heavily.\n\nWhen the grilled jerk chicken was presented, it was glorious because you find the Caribbean influences presented on the dish; a white wine vinegar drizzled slaw, roasted pineapple, and a succulent, savory corncob.  Where the chicken is the heart of the meal, the corn was the soul.  Paired together, I couldn't have been more delighted.\n\nTo drink, we had the D&G Spicy Ginger Beer imported from Jamaica.  Erm, I typically like Ginger Beer, but this one was branded as spicy and they f'ing mean it.  Be careful that you are prepared for spice-on-spice if you order it.  Looking back, i probably should have stuck with water, although the Ginger Beer was rudimentary for palate preservation as you meander through all of the various flavors of this cuisine.  Honestly, I cannot wait to go here to grab a Guinness (a Jamaican staple according to Zane Lamprey) or a Red Stripe.  The surging spiciness demands a brew that could handle this oral development.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased Breadfruit braved the Great Menace that is downtown development.  Here's to them gaining credibility as they continue to master their art (its not perfect yet, but please believe, its in the mail) and invigorate a local following of foodies and tourists alike to sample some mean Caribbean food.",1

My second time I order my food then a bagel sandwich for my husband. Before I could finish my order the server cuts me off. Shouting at me when he does it, he quickly apologizes for shouting and tells me about how he is having a rough day.... Then I get to where I need to pay and there is no one there. One lady looks over at me and says someone will be right with me. Then she goes to where you order and starts asking him to switch with her. Made me feel like she didn't want to help me. So I get my food get home and my husbands sandwich was made wrong. We spent over $7.00 for his sandwich alone and to not have it right after being treated rudely is not a good business.

3635,Where do I start....\nWe went there on a Monday night when they are offering all day happy hour meals at a discounted price.

We had to wait for almost an hour (almost walked out the door) until he finished the other tables and came to us (poor guy had to cook two tables at one time!).

3638,"Best club I've ever been to.\n\nThere's a lot of potential pitfalls, but if you just do a little bit of preparation, this place can be the venue for an awesome night out.\n\nI have gone to Tao and XS and unfortunately experienced the well-known horror story of the entrance lines for Vegas clubs.  If you just walk up to a club and try to get in, the popular clubs will make people wait up to 2 hours... which is a buzzkill (both for your alcohol level and your energy mood).\n\nThis time, I made sure our entire group got pre-sale tickets.  I pushed for this heavily, and man was everyone glad I did.  When we arrived at the club, we saw a HUGE wrap-around line of people trying to get in general admission.  This was only at 11:20pm, so still relatively early.  I'm guessing those people had to wait at least an hour to get in.\n\nBy getting pre-sale tickets (a hefty $50 for men, $20 for women), we bypassed the line completely and were inside the club within 30 seconds.  Awesome.  I highly, highly recommend getting the pre-sale tickets if you're a guy.\n\nPrices: Typical vegas club fare.  Cocktail for about $14-15 per person, beers are $8-10.  This is exorbitant by any normal standards, but typical for Vegas standards.\n\nWhile we didn't wind up getting a table, I was told that 10 people on a friday night would have a $2000 spending minimum.\n\nNow finally to the venue. It is amazing. There are 3 club levels, and the place is gigantic.  There's a main dance floor on the top level which is super crowded, with a surrounding walkway.  This is pretty much identical to the layout of XS.  However, this main dance floor has an outside pool area which is GIGANTIC and has multiple bars with plenty of space.  The top level is primarily electronic music.\n\nThe middle level is smaller, but still a decent sized space for people to dance.  This room plays primarily hip-hop music.\n\nI didn't get to go to the bottom level.\n\nThroughout the night, they consolidated the rooms and made people migrate to the highest floor.  I assume this was as the club was thinning out, so they wanted the rooms to merge into one so that it still gave off the \""""crowded\"""" vibe and didn't seem like the party was dying out.  I actually have to say, an excellent strategy as when club momentum is dying, people usually flee for the exits.\n\nThe clientele was nice.  Obviously dressed up to a high degree, guys sometimes in suits and girls mostly in short skirts and high heels.  There is a dress code but it's not AS strict as they claim, as I saw plenty of guys in jeans and non-dress shoes.  I wouldn't risk it too much so just look somewhat nice if you'd like to get in.\n\nThe women were really hot.  Just sayin'.  Also, this crowd had a very large Asian bias, which was kinda surprising.  I'm not saying that it was an asian night by any means, but I'd say the crowd was about 30-40% asian, which is pretty high for a generic club night.\n\n\nThere are some negatives, so I can't give this place 5 stars.  The prices are exorbitant, especially the $50 cover for guys.  The drinks are super pricey so you should either be a baller and get bottle service or pre-game before coming here.\n\nThe bouncers never gave me trouble at all, but I can spot douche bouncers when I see them.  I imagine they can be trouble for some more inebriated patrons.\n\nIf I were asked by people which club to go to in Vegas, I would say Marquee without any hesitation.",1
3639,"I honestly can't remember the last time I had worse experience at a restaurant.  I have been known to forgive bad service when the food makes up for it, but on this occassion that wasn't the case.  The food was not the worst part of our dinner at RM but it didn't do much to overcome the offensively awful service. \n\nTo begin with, it was not clear when I made the reservation whether or not the upstairs (more upscale) part of the restaurant was open.  I gathered from the website that it was not and we took our seats downstairs when we were seated.  Our waiter told us once we were seated that it was open and suggested that we come back while we were in Las Vegas to eat up there.  Well, I will never be returning to RM in my life and I would never take a suggestion from that waiter.  \n\nWhich brings me to my next point....\n\nOur waiter, Daniel, was a complete imbicile.  It was almost as if he was in an entirely different place than us, because he was so oblivious to what was going on at our table.  To begin with, service was very slow.  It did take us a while to decide on our dinner, but that didn't mean that we wanted to wait to be served our dinner once we ordered.  Nor did it mean that we wanted to sit there with our empty appetizer and salad plates in front of us for the duration of our wait for our entrees either.  The wine took an equally long time to arrive.  \n\nDaniel was absent for much of the meal unless he was trying to upsell us on something and we often had to ask the food runners or other servers for extra plates and for bread.  We were never offered bread and I noticed that other people had these wax paper-lined baskets on their tables and I had to assume that bread was offered at this establishment and ask for it myself.  That, to me, is a major transgression.  I'm glad we did, not only because our wait for our entrees was so long, but because the little biscuits in those baskets were really delicious.  \n\nWhen our meal did arrive, my surf and turf was all wrong.  The turf was very rare and when I flagged Daniel over to tell him, he wanted to take the entire plate away and I suggested that I could still eat my surf rather than have it sit under a heating lamp while the kitchen refired my filet.  So Daniel brings me a bread plate to flop my entire half of a 2 pound lobster onto.  When we flagged down another server to get me a bigger plate, he looked at the lobster hanging off of my plate and seemed embarrassed.  When I did get to dig into my lobster, it tasted like it had, in fact, been sitting under a heat lamp for too long.\n\nI told Daniel to forget the steak because we had a show to catch that we were nearly late for at this point.  A few minutes later a young girl, who was possibly a manager or maybe a mime came to the table with my steak and whispered some sort of apology, but no one at our table could even hear what she said because she was so soft-spoken and timid.  They brought me my steak anyway, because they clearly sitll wanted to charge me $40 for it.  All in all, I ended up with an improperly cooked, $80 meal, that I had to eat as quickly as possible.\n\nWhen I got my steak, most of our table was done with their meals.  Apparently the cobia and the scallops were good, but there was so much going on at the table and we were so rushed that it didn't seem to matter.  I had to try to scarf down my filet, which is not my preferred manner of eating in order to get out of that horrible restaurant and make it to our show.  As I was downing my steak and my fellow patrons were staring at their empty plates, Daniel came by and asked  \""""So far so good?\""""  What?  What planet was this guy on and to whom was he speaking because clearly this was not the appropriate thing for him to say.  Nor was it appropriate that he walked away from our table empty handed after we requested our check.  \n\nBefore we dashed out to catch a cab, my sister-in-law and I visited the filthy ladies room while the guys paid the bill.  They split the bill on their credit cards and Daniel, true to form, brought only one pen for both of them to find a spot on the cluttered table and fill in their overly generous ten percent tip.",0

Yes, the units are dated, but wonderful floorplans, very clean, spacious decks, extra storage, actual laundry rooms (older equipment, but works great).  I am a single woman and feel completely safe despite often arriving home late.  I LOVE that they allow pets by breed (not size).  \n\nThe award-winning grounds are outstanding with something beautiful blooming year-round and well maintained palm, pine and native trees.  There is a wonderful greenbelt where my dog loves to run each morning and meet his many pals - a virtual playground for the dogs.  The adjacent golfcourse and walking/biking path is easy to access and another beautiful place to walk.  the many varieties of migrating birds are spell-binding from geese and ducks to beautiful huge blue heron and two or three kinds of all white birds - snow geese? egrets? not sure, but I counted over 40 of them one day in the golf course lakes.  \n\nWhile the pool furniture may be older - it is in very acceptable condition -- the area is super clean, the pools and fountains are beautiful and well-maintained. The gym and common areas as well.  \n\nThe maintenance staff is super responsive and friendly, as are the groundskeepers.  The office staff is helpful, and responsive, but seem to have their hands tied by a less caring management.  You definitely get the feel that the complex is not a labor of love, but about business and the bottom line.  And, in fairness, it is a business, not a condominium complex. Doing more would increase the rents which I thought for all you get were very reasonable.  If they were condos,  I would buy in here in a minute.  Also, people who live here are friendly, respectful, all ages,  and it is very quiet - unlike several other complexes I considered. The unique 3-bedroom units are great for families.  Also,the central location and easy access to 101 is ideal. I am very sorry to be heading back North and leaving San Antigua, but will remember my time here very positively.  Would highly reccomend to anyone.",1
3643,"Bobby C's is what a neighborhood pub is all about.  The fact that it serves up soul food and hosts some amazing music is icing on the cake.\n\nBut what makes the family owned and operated bar & lounge stand out is the fact that, from the minute you walk it, until you leave, you're treated like a member of their family. with in minuted we were joking and kidding around, a few minutes later, we were being given a tour of the facility, including their overflow seating next door.\n\nUntil now, it's been a hidden gem with a loyal following of people into live jazz and R&B, or this looking to sate their southern food cravings.  However, with a light rail stop outside, I predict it will be getting a whole lot more attention, (Hint: it is a must stop venue for any Light Rail pub crawls)",1
3644,"After reading all the rave reviews of this spa, I couldn't resist but booked myself for a massage there after a long week of convention activities. The facility was impeccable and it was great since it was earlier part of the morning. \nThe classic massage ($140) by Aaron was heavenly, he had strong hands but definitely helped eased the knots away from the tight shoulders and also exhausted feet. \n\nThe roman baths were great since I was the only person there. The steam room, the arctic snow room was different with tiny snow flakes failing from the ceiling...in a spa, that's a first time!:)\n\nThe entire facility was top notch, clean and sanitized and definitely comparable to Burke Williams. I would definitely return for a masage again or facial if I return to sin city. \n\nHappy ending, yes! Not that way, silly!",1
3645,"Let me start by saying that I have not eaten here. My review is purely based on my inability to reach anyone to place a delivery order. \n\nBased on the wonderful reviews and a friends recommendation, I was so excited to try King Wong and loved the idea that they deliver! I tried for TWO hours to reach someone to place an order. After many attempts, unanswered calls, and busy signals....I gave up and moved on.  It is unlikely that I would try again. Disappointing.",0
3646,I had an appointment with Dr. McLeish today & arrived 10 minutes late due to construction on Scottsdale Rd.  It was my 1st visit & was told he would not see me.  They had collected my insurance information (Medicare + a supplement) prior so I suspect he chose not to see me partly because he didn't want to accept Medicare.  He also has a HUGE sign up announcing that he is an alumni of Mayo Clinic so why did he leave the clinic (also in Scottsdale)?  I suspect he wanted to charge more money.  I will NOT reschedule as this gave me a view into how poorly he probably treats his patients.  While I was in the office I overheard the front office lady tell a patient who had just come out of the exam room that she did not have time to schedule his next visit.  She said she would call him later....  Who needs this kind of treatment?,0
3647,"I think you gotta love the \""""Stillers\"""" or be a Pitt fan to understand why anyone would think this place is terrific.  Sorry guys, I don't necessarily get it.   This is certainly not the most horrible stadium I have ever visited, but it sure isn't up to snuff with many of the other stadiums about the country.  Went to a Univeristy of Pitt football game over the weekend.  Since I am from out of town, I was not familiar with the layout or where to enter in terms of where my seats were located.  Got some pretty bad directions from the staff working outside of the stadium and needless to say, I spent almost the entire first quarter of the game attempting to find our seats.  \n\nI will say that once seated, the view is good and nothing that I could see would impart your vision of the field from wherever you are sitting.  Food offerings are your standard fare (hot dogs, soda, hamburgers, nachos, etc,) - nothing out of the ordinary.  \n\nThe main concourse on the street level is pretty nice, and gives you a nice sense of the history of the \""""Stillers\"""" and is really a walk down memory lane, even for those of us who don't live in Pittsburgh but remember the teams from the 70's and their glory days.  (Yes, admittedly, they are still a pretty terrific team!).\n\nLoved the Heintz bottles on the fan-o-vision that tip over and look like ketsup running down the screen - very cool!",0
3648,"It used to be great. We came in before the dinner rush for a family dinner for 8. Sat in the very sticky (seriously my shoes are still sticking to everything) bar area and ordered some drinks and apps before moving to our table. Garlic Fries and Flatbread were good, but drink menu was limited because they were out of mint and 1/3 of their cocktail menu uses mint. \n\nOne big thing that I couldn't help but notice when I walked up the stairs are all of the bins full of water surrounding the hostess podium, look up and there's major leaks coming from the ceiling...um, okay? We're not talking a waterfall, but definitely a steady stream of water pouring through different areas of the ceiling. No acknowledgment even when it was mentioned.\n\nSo we sit down and place our orders. I've been before and do credit the selection. It's 6:30 now on Thursday night and we are the only table. Based on the food, I can see why. Chicken sandwich was inedible. The chicken was stringy and old like the bacon, looked like it was reheated in microwave. The taste? There really wasn't much taste, just salty. The shredded lettuce was subpar to even Applebee's and the roll didn't help either. I filled up on garlic fries and after we paid and I ventured straight over to Silvermine for a real dinner.  The rest of my inlaws were mixed on their reviews of dishes (lobster Mac - okay, fish and chips - pretty good, steak tacos - no).\n\nOverall, this place used to be nice, but food quality and atmosphere have taken a major tumble. I wouldn't be surprised if this spot is called something else next year.",0
3649,"Yanni's is one of our favorite restaurants.  Also, the owner Yanni is always helpful.  My personal favorite dish is the Lamb Gyro Salad.  It comes with warm pita great that is always delicious.\n\nI am looking forward to trying more dishes there soon.",1
3650,All you can eat and drink?! Oh yeah!! I've been waiting to try this place for so long. The drive is 10miles from the strip but well worth it. I came here for the Saturday brunch with my boys. We ate and drank up a storm. This place is really big and well lit up. The number of foods to choose from were out of this world. I'll recommend some of my favorite things to eat.\n\nSalmon sushi: Some pieces were beautifully fatty. I ate loads of this and threw away the rice. \n\nPrime rib: When you get a fatty one thats cooked medium rare then it's awesome. So juicy and tender. \n\nMimosa: endless amounts of champagne and oj. I left this place stumbling! \n\nSmoked Salmon bagels: Seriously the salmon here is too good! This normally would cost $10 for one. I ate so much of it. \n\nThose were the items I kept coming back to. They really had so much to choose from. I would definitely come back here.,1
3651,"Terrible--to be honest if the mixed smells don't scare you away the obvious addition of food coloring into everything breaded should.\n\nI've eaten here three times and every time I've been violently sick, off two chicken dishes and one pork.\n\nAny hole in the wall Chinese restaurant is better then this!",0
3652,"Delicious place for lunch. Pleasant inside, a little ratty-looking outside... but, oh the food! First-rate middle eastern, well prepared and served nice and hot. Hummus, as others commented is excellent -- mild and well-balanced. Had the chicken kabob plate and the fowl was everything others have said: juicy, perfectly cooked, and spices were just right. Wife had chicken kabob sandwich which came wrapped in a massive fresh-baked pita. A little too much bread for her so she picked the chicken and tabouli out -- should have ordered the kabob plate.\n\nService prompt, cheerful without being patronizing. Two of us for lunch with Cokes (free refills... and also free refills on the fresh flatbread basket) about $23, and worth every penny. We'll definitly go back. Thanks, Yelp!",1
3653,"I was in Vegas a couple weeks ago. I saw some shows, and went to a bunch of casinos. I heard Stratosphere was a bit run down but I was pleasantly surprised when I got there. They had a great Italian restaurant!! The casino was very clean and my buddies had a blast learning to play Craps... even though we didn't win. Lots of fun machines to play there too. Also, the show we saw at 1030 there was great.",1
3654,"HAND PULLED NOODLES...  I have had these before in Hong Kong and Cali.  Never expected in AZ.  These are as fresh as you can get your noodles!!!\n\nGot the #18 - Beef with Oyster Sauce and I picked the standard ramen noodles.  The noodles were good and the flavor of the beef and oyster sauce was outstanding!!  The steamed dumplings were so so good.  YUM YUM!!!  Also ordered the milk tea with boboa (it was ok).  \n\nThe service was ok too.  We were waiting for 2 more people to join us, they never came to take our drink order.  They waited for everyone to get there and then took our drinks & food order.",1
3655,"First time trying this restaurant, and we won't be back. It took 45 minutes to get breakfast. Water glasses were not refilled, and we weren't asked if we wanted another pot of coffee. The potatoes were lukewarm/cold and hard as bricks. The egg dish was OK. My husband said his biscuits were hard. Not worth the time or money to return when better places are nearby.",0
3656,"Mas Amigos, I owe you an apology for not upgrading your rating sooner.  I've been back several times since my first review, and you are now one of my favorite restaurants in C-U.\n\nI have to reiterate that the chips and salsa are INCREDIBLE.  And that green sauce (a mixture of avocados, tomatillos, and jalape\u00f1os) should really just be poured straight into my mouth from now on.  I want it on everything.  Their lunch specials are cheap and delicious, and for God's sake, order their tacos with onion and cilantro.  Soooo good.\n\nDos is dead.  Viva Mas Amigos!",1
3657,"I hate to review this place like a normal pet store when they are really just a low-budget dog groomer but if you are going to sell food, toys, and clothes too, you should really do it right.  \n\nOh Smelly Dog.  For years I have driven by you and thought \""""Hmph, I wonder what that place is like\"""" as I head over to my favorite dog wash down the street (Wag N Wash) or to my favorite dog accessory store up Camelback (Oliver & Annie).  Since O&A closed and the owner told us he was sending his supplies over to Smelly Dog, we figured we HAD to try it.\n\nWe walk in and the place is a disaster.  Dog baths just out in the middle of the store with little yippie dogs all tied up near the door.  The floor was wet with pools of water which made it very slippery and dangerous.  The food selection is slim...like you have two choices.  I like that one of them is local but they could stand to carry a few others.  Their toy selection is okay but they could stand to carry WestPaw too.  They dog-clothing is pretty much limited to small dog stuff which is also too bad.\n\nThe one girl who worked there was pretty enthusiastic and helpful but the checkout girl completely pissed me off when she allowed a wash customer to cut in front of me to pay after I had stood there for 5 minutes.\n\nThis place has too many shortcomings to replace the wonderful Wag N Wash.  I'll be going to Noble Beast for accessories now.  Sorry...Smelly Dog is just too chaotic for me.",0
3658,"Bottom line:  If you need a wedding venue in Las Vegas - there are certainly no shortages of them.  However, I'll put in my vote for Caesars Palace.\n\nI'll start off by saying that originally I had absolutely no desire to get married in Vegas.  I had originally determined that Virginia would be the place for us - it's where we live, it's where we met; the hardest part - finding that special spot not only for the wedding, but for the wedding reception. When I couldn't find anything to my liking, I started thinking that perhaps Vegas wouldn't be so bad (it is after all where he proposed to me).  I had some friends turn me on to Caesars Palace.  Mr. Douglas G helped me set up everything I needed and also put me in contact with others to help me make it an experience I won't forget. \n\nGregg and I wanted simple, no fuss and intimate with family and friends.  Caesars had the perfect package - the Bella Luna. Our wedding coordinator, Lindsay was awesome!  She guided me through each step usually with just a form to film out or a question to answer (nice and simple the way I like it).  On the day of the wedding, she called me to make sure I had everything I needed and helped it all go smooth.  The photographer was very professional and took lots of photographs - I can't wait to see them all.   As a venue it was perfect, I could not have asked for anything better!  \n\nThanks again to Douglas and Lindsay, but also to Irene P for arranging our Friday night pre-wedding festivities, and Sandra B for arranging our wedding dinner.  Thank you all for making our wedding weekend no stress and perfect!",1

3660,"I went to this restaurant last week with my girlfriend and her roommate. First off, this place really is \""""Wooohoooo! As good as it gets!\"""" I was enthralled to see that type of ambience that this area/restaurant offered. Pinnacle Peak is a gorgeous area with breathtaking desert scenery. Soul Caf\u00e9 takes the word \""""caf\u00e9\"""" to a whole new level. I had no idea that it would be that nice but it was pleasantly taken aback. I went here for dinner and I guess it just opened up for that time of night. It is usually a breakfast and lunch time place. But still, the dinner was phenomenal! I had the steak and fries! Great portions and reasonably priced for a place that exquisite is something to be found there. No more leaving still hungry because you got an expensive steak that took you spread five bites over the entire dinner! The live music~the best part of the evening~ was performed by a regular group called \""""WHAT4.\"""" I believe they play during the day as well but their music set the mood singlehandedly. They literally can play ANYTHING. I found myself liking songs they performed better than the ones on the radio, etc!! Some songs I solely liked because they performed. The musicians were very friendly and was a great duo!! Sure they has lots of success! Definitely something to see if you haven't already! They were not distracting and played any request you wanted. Songs from The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, to current hot songs. They are very talented indeed! Again, at 13/10 rating for me!",1

I would travel to Indianapolis and eat there as much as I possibly could because I knew I would not be there again for another year.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen, my life was lived improperly. No man should be deprived of steak burgers and oreo milkshakes for a whole year and thus Las Vegas - specifically the South Point Hotel and Casino (which fortuitously happens to be one of the FIRST hotels you reach coming from Los Angeles) has stormed its way into my life and slapped my hopes and dreams into reality. \n\nFrisco Melt is now on crunchy sourdough - IMPROVEMENT\nthe $4 meal deals are still intact - EXCELLENT VALUE\nHappy Hour of half-priced shakes - POSITIVE ENERGY EVERYWHERE\n\nThis has instantly become a staple of mine and I will literally go to vegas more often simply because of this restaurant.

3662,"They advertise free accounts, but I have found that the opposite is true.  I have paid inactivity fees, falling below the balance fees, not using auto pay fees, etc.  More of my money went to them than to me or my household accounts.  Very disappointed.",0
3663,"Mehhhh.\n\nMaybe it's my fault (ok, it's completely my fault) for ordering the heat-attack slice from hell. Pepperoni, ham, sausage and bacon layered between bread and a hearty helping of cheese topped with more bacon, but it was a bit too much. Difficult to eat and just tasted like salty grease. I've eaten a meatlovers before but this slice....I don't know....it just didn't taste good. Which is saying alot because bad pizza is still pizza. I'll have to go back and try one of their less meatier slices.",0

3665,"One star is more than these guys deserve.  After my original review I sent a message to Aaron Pools through their \""""contact us\"""" form.  Below is the response I received from them (I removed last names):\n\nDear Becky,\n\nWe have no idea who you are or who you think you are judging our company who has been in business for over 35 years...you are not our customer.\n\nMr. A. is who we have been \""""dealing\"""" with because HE is our customer and with whom you should perhaps show this letter to...he can contact us to dispute anything contained in this correspondence.\n\nMr. A. had an appointment for us to replace the grids in the filter at 2939 E. Bonanza Road, Gilbert, AZ.  HE is the one who cancelled the appointment so he could research the grid cost and find them at a lesser cost to him.  He did find grids and advised us he would drop the grids off early the week of May 7th but that he would call us to advise us when he in fact had dropped the grids off.  About the only thing you did agree with our office staff is that he did not drop them off until the afternoon of May 10 and when he called us that day he expected an appointment immediately.  We advised him we could not guarantee somebody out there as our schedule was full but we would try to get somebody there that day or Friday.  He was aware that we were booking at that time for the following week.  If he had dropped the grids off earlier in the week as he had advised us he would we would have been able to get this resolved before the weekend of May 12/13, 2012.  We realize Mr. A. is busy, as are we, but we cannot make him find the time to drop them off as he had expected.\n\nAdditionally, your pool is cloudy at worse, not green.  If these filters had been taken care of as set on OUR ORIGINAL TIME FRAME APPOINTMENT before Mr. A. cancelled to look for grids on his own, you would not be having this problem created by the grids not being authorized by Mr. Angelotti for us to handle.  It is understandable that home owners are trying to cut back on expenses but we cannot take the heat for that situation.  You really need to take this up with Mr. A.  If he has told you anything other than as we are stating above, I would challenge that statement!\n \nbilling@aaronpools.com\nAaron Pools, Inc.\n480-839-9041\n\nWhat they don't know is that our landlord is one of our closest friends and everything he tells me is the truth.  I AM the customer, because I was the one who originally said I wanted Aaron Pools to be our pool service.  They were hired because of me, and they will now be fired because of me.  Their customer service skills are definitely in line with their pool servicing skills.  After our pump was finally working again, the pool cleaner guy came out and I asked him about the chlorine level because I had been testing it and it was reading very high.  He dipped his little test strip in and told me everything looked fine.  After he left I took a sample over to Leslie's and had them test it.  The chlorine was at 15ppm!  Good thing I didn't let my kids go swimming.  Stay away from these guys.  How they have managed to stay in business for over 35 years will remain a mystery.",0

I would love to tell you how that was but they never received their food. The rest of us still tried the brunch because the waitress promised more food...nothing got better even down to not having any plates. They weren't even busy so I don't know what happened with that.

3671,"Welcome home new (drastically discounted) designer handbag. Thank you Marshall's!\n\nAs others have said, this is a smaller store with less variety than the Cotswold location. I have to add that with a little bit of patience and persistence, you can find a great deal at this Marshall's as well. I've come to this store if the Cotswold location is out of my size in a particular shoe - it's great to have two stores within a short drive of each other.\n\nLadies, if you're looking for spring or summer dresses, this store JUST stocked up. There are lots of bright Calvin Klein or Nine West dresses in a variety of sizes. It's much less picked over than the Cotswold location.

Quite delicious. I had it paired with truffle fries, they were pretty good as well. \nMy friend had a slaw chee salad with seared ahi. It was very tasty. We both agreed we could eat that every week for the rest of the foreseeable future. \nI can see us going back here really soon.

It was pink and girly...definitely what I was in the mood for. \n\nFor food I had the duck 'street tacos'. I love anything and everything with duck, but then add foie gras, and truffle cream and stuff it into a crispy tortilla? yuuummmm! \n\nAlso ordered the Lobster Mac-n-cheese. Its a perfect size portion (so you can eat it all and be guilt-free). I just happen to be a mac-n-cheese connoisseur, so I've had my share of cheesy noodles. This one is really good with the lobster and truffle cream, but not my favorite. However the dish comes with a mini lobster BLT that is so good I would definitely order it again. (You can only get this little mini blt with the mac, it's not a menu item on its own). \n\nHolsteins is a cool hang-out spot.  Not just an ordinary burger joint, they have really creative things on the menu that you wouldn't expect. Will definitely come back, there are still so many things I want to try!",1
3683,"Came back, and I'd write the exact same review all over again.\n\nNow pass me the potato gnocchi, please. And as for Tony P's issue, sorry Tony - but go marry yourself that British chic and bring her back here for some good Gnocchi and Chianti! I'll buy if you do!",1
3684,So last January I made the mistake of staying with my friends at the Tropicana. Ok so we get the the Tropicana check in and everything is fine. Me and my wifey had our own single bedroom. So we go up to the 15th floor what luck our room is right next to the elevator which is a super plus! Little did we know that when we swiped our card through the door what was in store for us... Ok so I have to give the tropicana points for doing a great job with the remodeling it is very nice. A big downer was the room not being clean.. luckily my wifey is a neat freak so she jumped all over it. Some towels were dirty so we pushed those aside and made due. Glasses were spotty didn't even look like they were washed. There were long black hairs on the bed. Luckily we just checked in so the wifey couldn't get crazy. lol. Everything else was ok just really lame that we had to clean up before we got there. Thankfully the slot gods made my trip worth while!,0
3685,"Excellent food and atmosphere. Servers are attentive and also very friendly. They have a lot of different rooms to sit in. We sat in the whiskey room which had a bunch of different Irish whiskey on display to choose from. Very authentic Irish pub, would definitely go back.",1
3686,"We arrived at the hotel, and the wait was not bad to check in. We got up to the room and it was disgusting. The glasses had lipstick stains, and the bathroom wall was disgusting. We immediately went downstairs and the receptionist told us that they didn't have any rooms. So we asked her to at least send someone up to clean the room, and she went and talked to a manager. TADA! A new room magically opened up. This room wasn't much cleaner, but at least the glasses were cleaned and we have a remote control. We got comped a Buffett, but really it doesn't make up for the disgusting rooms and the mediocre service. We will stay elsewhere next time. Disgusted.",0
3687,"This is a cozy little place for meeting.  My sister and I had a quick cup of coffee and split one of their generous apple turnovers.  It was the perfect pick me up treat to get through the late morning.  The service was excellent and the food and coffee were perfect.  In addition to the sweets and cakes on display, they have a table with an entire portfolio of notebooks that demonstrate their artistic competence in cake-making for any occasion.  We were not disappointed at all - go support this wonderful bakery!!",1
3688,"This hotel was very beautiful, and if you are use to being pampered and have a bit of money to throw around then this is totally the place for you!\n\nMy room was beautiful and spacious, as was my bathroom.  The staff around the hotel were also wonderful and helpful.\n\nI did find it a little annoying that despite the lovely decor and all, I didn't have a fridge in my room!  I mean, there was a mini bar (which had everything hooked up to pressure sensors that would automatically charge my room if I even picked up anything), but no place to put anything I brought in myself.  I ended up filling one of my bathroom sinks with ice and keeping my drinks in there for the week.  Not the classiest thing but it worked!\n\nAlso, it is a serious hike to get anywhere in this super confusing hotel, and even more confusing if you ever try to leave it!  It took me and a friend over an hour and directions from 3 different employees to finally get outside the damn place!  I work in a shop and am pretty used to being on my feet and walking most of the day, but this place made that seem like nothing!  Even a few days after being home my feet are still hurting (and no, I wasn't tromping around Vegas in heals, I was wearing sneakers.  I don't even own a pair of heels!)\n\nI would definitely stay here again if someone else was paying the bill.  Next time I'm in Vegas for fun, I think I will try to find something a bit more... casual...",1
3689,"I love the wings but the service is atrocious, I come here every week and every time I'm shocked by the lack of management and disregard for basic customer service. If you come here DO NOT I repeat, DO NOT make plans for after. You will be here for a while.",0
3690,"Had lunch there today and really liked the food. I had the street tacos which were a pretty good value. I had the Tacos Al Pastor, very tasty and affordable. Atmosphere wise it was like being in a Mexico. Probably not a place you would take your girlfriend for a romantic dinner but if you are looking for some good street tacos this is a great place in Chandler.",1
3691,"We decided to try out Ruth's Chris during restaurant week and it was pretty darn good.  Under normal circumstances I can't justify spending $100+ on a meal for two people but during restaurant week we were able to get amazing food for almost half the cost.\n\nThe customer service was excellent!  They provide free valet and the hostess checked our coats as we walked in the door.  We had to wait an extra 20 minutes on our table even with a reservation, but that can probably be attributed to restaurant week.  Our server was outstanding as they usually are for upscale restaurants.\n\nThe restaurant week menu is limited but all I wanted was a filet so I was totally satisfied with the options.  The steak was perfectly cooked and each bite melted in my mouth!  So delicious!  We ordered a side of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes which were also quite good.  The chocolate sin cake dessert is more like a dark chocolate slice of fudge or flourless cake.  It was very good but not quite what I was expecting.\n\nThis is a great place to go to celebrate a special occasion, or if you just don't mind spending a little extra money for a nice meal.",1
3692,"When I travel, I feel compelled to eat at as many different restaurants as I can.  I figure if you're only going to be there temporarily you should try as many different things as you possibly can!  On my recent 3-week business trip to Montr\u00e9al, there were only two restaurants that I visited more than once.  One of them was La Maison De Kebab.\n\nOf course, as others have previously said in one way or another, the meat here is delicious.  Well seasoned and cooked beautifully, the large slab of fillet was plated alongside white and yellow rice and a side salad with a creamy, flavorful dressing.  A random grilled tomato comes along for the ride, although I don't care for tomatoes so that stayed put.  The meal was massive, but fantastic. Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-maison-de-kebab-montreal?select=XrjW5AYHYOMHJkywZcEizw#6H2k8BP3eImk5Dx9c9D5Nw\n\nNow as much as I love that meal, I know that I've also experienced other excellent meals in the city.  So why was La Maison De Kebab worthy of that second visit?\n\nOddly enough, lentil soup.\n\nBefore the meal came out on my first visit, I was given a bowl of lentil soup.  I didn't know it was lentil soup at the time, even getting it was a surprise because it wasn't mentioned on the menu as a part of the meal.  There's something special about it though, warming with a great thickness and texture. This tasty soup was topped with a drizzle of yogurt, and in the middle was what seemed to be some sort of mixture of blackened mint and maybe olive oil.  I'm not sure, but it was fragrant and delicious, and it really elevated the soup to something spectacular.  Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-maison-de-kebab-montreal?select=XrjW5AYHYOMHJkywZcEizw#uc14oLnZD0l75_9HPClikA\n\nI went back to the loft and didn't stop thinking about that soup for the rest of my visit.  I posted about it on Facebook, attempting to enlist the help of others in determining what type of soup it was so I could try to find it locally when I got home.  I HAD to go back for a second visit, if only to find out what that soup was!\n\nMuch to my dismay, it was \""""just\"""" lentil soup -- there was no special name that I could refer to in a restaurant back home where they'd reply, \""""Oh yes!  We have that exact soup that you are craving!\""""  It's the best lentil soup I've ever had, but so much more than lentil soup, and in all likelihood I'll never see another like it until the next time I visit this beautiful city.",1

3694,"Just stayed here for my first time last weekend, and it was surprisingly awesome. The room was a lot better than I expected it to be. I'd have to say I wasn't in the westgate towers but, the hallways off the elevator make it look kind of trashy, but once you get into the rooms, it's all good. It's very conveniently located near the miracle mile shops so you can pick up some decently priced grub...ESPECIALLY EARL OF SANDWICH, 6$ sandwiches open 24/7...that's money right there...The casino is nice, it has the pleasure pit, which everyone loves, and it's conveniently located in the middle of the strip across from City Center, and Paris is right next door. The stay I had was pretty excellent.",1
3695,"I reviewed a message from the manager, Dawn, less than 24 hours from my first visit apologizing about the situation. I think it's great when a manager can admit to faults and grow themselves and their team from mistakes. I was not expecting her to reach out to me or invite me to come back for a great experience. I understand that mistakes happen and they are all teachable moments, it just depends on the accountability and ownership and their actions to rectify moving forward. I have accepted her invitation to come back and look forward to the great experience she guarantees I will have.",1
3696,"This place went from 4 stars for food and service to 2 stars. The menu change is horrible! They no longer offer their turkey burger, La Campagne which was delicious. You no longer have the option to choose the flavors for a milkshake and they now all come with alcohol. You can opt to not have the alcohol added, however it is the same price. I had a chocolate nutella shake prior to this visit and it was amazing, this time around I had it again (minus the alcohol) and it wasn't anything special. The combos are no longer offered, which was a great deal that included a burger, fries, and a shake. \n\nI went on a Saturday night around 9pm and service was horrible! Our cheeseburger mac n cheese bites came out cold, however, our server did get us a new \""""hot\"""" order. I ordered a BBQ chicken burger this time and it was good but for the price, it wasn't great. The restaurant was somewhat busy, but waiting 40 minutes for our burgers was unacceptable. Due to the menu changes and slow service, I most likely will not be returning.",0
3697,We orders crepes and cheese fondue with sundry tomato. We are so full after all. The crepes are nice. I don't like the taste of the cheese fondue (probably the taste of wine or sundry tomato). I like that they have so many choices on crepes.,1
3698,"I was recommended to make a reservation here for the outside terrace where there is a stunning view of the Bellagio light and water show. Great recommendation.\n\nFor three girls, we had two appetizers and split a less expensive bottle of red wine and it came to around $100 before tip. A good value for excellent food, service and a great show.\n\nAs young girls on a budget, we chose the cheapest red wine on the menu and the server - a lovely older gentlemen was nice enough to point out that it wasn't a typical wine and doesn't have much flavor so he gave us a sample. Definitely the blandest red wine I've ever had. We were so grateful that the server was looking out for his guests rather the check average. Or at least it seemed so. So we ordered his recommendation, a wine only a few dollars more.\n\nAs for the food - ordered the beef tartare and the fig and proscuitto flatbread. The beef tartare was very good, but the flatbread was out of this world amazing. So simple, but the ingredients went so well together.\n\nIf you had to go to one nice restaurant while in Vegas, this one is a good bet. Excellent food, great view and show of Las Vegas and wonderful service.",1
3699,"It was amazing how bad the service we received at the SW Steakhouse was. We had a party of six, and waited over an hour for our entrees. Members of our group never received drinks that were ordered. Our service staff was disinterested in us and how our experience was. By far the most disappointing part of our Vegas trip. We will not be returning to SW.",0
3700,"Right when you walk in, you are greeted by Amazon Parrots. Hands down the coolest thing ever! Giant Checker and Chess boards, beautiful decor, and friendly staff. Our bartender Brandon was such an awesome host, made recommendations, and always made sure we had everything we needed! The rooftop bar plus a nice Arizona Spring afternoon was a great combination!  The photos of the food we had speak for them selves. Will be coming back again and again.",1
3701,Music is an integral part of my life.  If I don't go to at least 2 concerts every month I start to go through withdrawals. I'm a much bigger fan of smaller venues than massive sized arenas.  When the venue is smaller the entire concert experience is enhanced because it's more intimate and you're closer to the artist.  \n\nNeighborhood Theatre can seat a few hundred with mezzanine seating at stage right and floor seating facing the stage. The sound is great and spot on.  You can easily hear every note that is played or sung.  The only drawback is that the space is a bit dated and could use a few modern touches.  Other than the decor I think this place is awesome and will definitely be back for more concerts or events.,1
3702,"Heather R. and I had the absolute pleasure of happy houring at Twisted Rose yesterday evening! The cuisine, service, wine, prices & quality were superb.  Both the partner & the executive chef stopped by to chat for quite a while, they were quite delightful! I can't stop raving about the bread pudding, it was distinctively summery due to the raspberry addition.  I adore that the chef uses their wines creatively in the menu, the addition adds another level of flavor.  Sidenote: the powder rooms are adorable and spotless! I'll be back with a crowd very soon.",1
3703,"After a few hours hanging out at the bar, I was in the mood for a Fatburger.  I ordered a Large Fatburger with Cheese.  The wait was the usual 15+ min....standard for Fatburger.

3704,"So my boyfriend was giving me a hard time for being a bratty princess with the need to stay at a fancy place. Ok, fine, I'll show you. I booked this hotel as a Christmas \""""gift\"""" to him just to show I can stay in such \""""cheap\"""" place. \n\nAnd boy was this cheap, as in, cheap in every way. The room was mediocre at best. The floors had stains of god knows what and the bathroom arrangement was retarded. Only the shower and toilet was on tiled floor, the sink is outside in the carpeted area. It  was... stupid. The walls were ridiculously thin and you can hear EVERYTHING. My friend told us about his bad experience with LVH with the maids throwing away all of his stuff had me paranoid so we stuffed our belongings in drawers and closets as well as took pictures of them to make sure we have proof. Luckily nothing happened but I do not want to go through that ordeal of feeling unsafe. \n\nMy boyfriend said we're never staying here again. HA! Proved you wrong hunny and even you were appalled. \n\nDON'T STAY HERE!",0

3706,"Usually good but today was terrible. Ordered eggs basted soft. Got scrambled. Sent back and they came back cold, basted with oil and burnt around the edges. Toast was pretty much NOT toasted.

3707,"New in Ahwatukee area and probably a great example of why Restaurants have such a great failure rate.

Not even a butter taste to it. Quite possibly the worst I have ever had! \n\nThe biscuits you ask? Awful as well, being thin and tasteless bordering on way too salty and equally inedible.\n\nIncidentally, when asked \""""how was everything\"""" I replied \""""not good,\"""" the Cashier didn't follow up to ask what was wrong, she just gave me my change and said \""""thanks for coming in.\""""\n\nThey will have to get lots better in order to make it.

3708,"Finally made it out to Twin Peaks. It's got a Mancave type layout, plenty of TV's and good looking waitresses. It was packed during the after-work rush and the ladies were hustling. Service was excellent but the food was disappointing. Obviously, no one comes here for the food but with so many dining options near the Biltmore, its a waste to try any food here. We had the sliders, chicken fingers and Cobb Salad. (All were sub-par)   \n\nTilted Kilt is miles ahead of Twin Peaks with better atmosphere and food. I'd even say Hooters is superior. I'm not a fan of the Cold Beer gimmick or Shot-skis but maybe I'm just getting old. Who's down for Sizzler, next time?",0

However my best friend wanted to pay, she refused in letting me do it, now this is the BAD part...she forgot her wallet at her house in Queen Creek:/ we canceled the order and left....\n\nNow a week goes by and just as my best friend and I were walking in laughing about how embarrassing the last visit was it was the same girl who took out order before, she seen us and immediately looked over at her co-worker and whispered something. Now I'm not the one to be judging, but I HATE when there is no confrontation..we walked to the cash register and she didn't even smile or greet us, we just had to say our order without being asked!!! Lack of customer service, and a little bit snobby I would say! I mean we made a simple mistake of forgetting out wallet, which I know we are not the only ones who have done it before. Overall great drinks as always but I won't be doing service with that particular girl anymore!!!",0
3710,"Quaint store. Very very friendly. Clean. Mist spray if you choose to sit outside. The aroma of coffee when you enter is pleasant and not overwhelming. \nSo I finally strayed from my norm of strawberries and cream. I tried the orange mango smoothies. Wonderful!

I absolutely will have this again.\nI have always enjoyed the variety of flavors of coffee, now I have found other flavors!",1

Bartender set menus down in front of us and walked away no greeting or anything like hi have you been here before etc... We asked for a couple samples again nothing was explained to us. Ordered our beer, then about 10 minutes later had to ask someone else if we could order food. Ordered the burger special, bartender did up sell the fries. Burger was okay, fries so,so if you like rosemary. Half way through dinner our beer was empty.  Bartender was right in front of us washing out growlers and never once asked how food was,or if we wanted another beer.  We finally caught bartenders attention and she said \""""I guess you are ready for your check\"""" then gave us a line about what a rough transition they had.  It doesn't matter if you are a full staff short, the customer should always be greeted and attended to, she could have told us they were short staffed in the beginning, instead of saying nothing and ignoring us.  Thankfully there are other breweries in Chandler that offer much better service and food. Definitely don't waste your money or time at Wilderness.",0
3712,"Food, service and options were terrible.  Just stopped in for desert and coffee.  How can you mess up desert and coffee??

I think that the food is always good, so that's the reason that I go back, but the service is not all that spectacular.  I've had many bad experiences hoping that it'll just get better and am still waiting for it to happen.\n\nOnce experience I had, I had gone out to lunch with my coworkers and ordered a Build Your Own Salad and had requested for some fried chicken.  Our food came out, but the friend chicken came 15 minutes after my salad had come out.  The server asked me (with a sort of attitude) if I still wanted the chicken or not.  I said sure.  The manager asked if everything was okay, I told him of the situation, and he didn't seem that concerned, but he did take 50% off my bill.  \n\nOther experiences I've had, I have learned to now check if my food is correct for take out before getting back to work.  Examples: No extra ranch when I asked for it, another time, I had ordered sweet tea to go only to find out once I got back to the office they gave me unsweet tea, having to ask them for ketchup when I already told them in my order that I wanted some ketchup on the side.  It's those things that have happened to me.\n\nI just hope that they can step up their game because I do enjoy their food, but their service just really needs a lot of work.",0
3714,"WHO DAT, DAT MADE DAT? Cause daaaaamn, that's good! \nI was at a Super Bowl party yesterday. You know, the one where the New Orleans SAINTS took the win? \n\nI had a taste of this restaurants catering job, a job well done! \n\nThe Jambalaya was delicious. It was the New Orleans style of course tossed with rice....awesome. The craw fish bread and the Creole style gumbo lulu were also delicious. Of course they did not forget to order the bread pudding, also delicious. \n\nYay! I'm a fan based on this catering and look forward to eating their food again. \n\np.s.

3716,"Our first time visiting the container park, my family (husband and 3 boys) and I stopped in for a treat. I believe we met 1 of the owners (Barry). He was awesome! He answered any questions we had and was very friendly. The candy is a little on the expensive side but we don't mind because we knew we were supporting a local business. Before we left he played a Jelly Belly game with us. There are multiple colors of jelly bellys but only 2 flavors per color. One good flavor or one disgusting flavor. You landed on white? Will you end up eating coconut or baby wipe flavor?  We enjoyed the game so much we bought 2.\n\nOne other thing is Barry seemed VERY open to suggestions on items to carry. We were trying to pick out a few things for our daughter who was in school at the time and I was talking to my husband about fake braces that I had seen at a magic store and how much our daughter would love some. Barry overheard us and explained that he was always looking for new and interesting items to carry. \n\nClean space, awesome customer service and good candy variety.

It's like a freaking amusement park out there complete with wave pool, waterslides, and lazy river. If I had kids or for that matter wanted kids, this would be the place to stay at.",0

We ordered tons of starters and everything was bla, dry, even the nachos went back!  I went the safe route and got the street style tacos and I'll tell you any Taco Truck in California is 100 times better than that dry, bland, chopped up fajita meat thrown on some greasy corn tortillas and then topped with raw chopped onions and some cilantro, I ate half of one and gave the rest all back. Ew. Actually one of my friends said she probably wouldn't eat Mexican food for a while, that's how bad it was. \nOh, and the cute bar girl poured tequila all over my face and  neck when I went up for the \""""Mas Tequila\"""" shot at the bar.

The only reason it isn't a 5 star restaurant is because of the slower service. While it wasn't a problem, it was a bit slow. I will return here without question... maybe the best French in Vegas!",1

3726,"I wanted a tattoo of my dog Zoey. I did my research on local artists and decided on Eddie. My research time really paid off because the work Eddie did is nothing short of awesome! The detail is incredible, right down to her whiskers.The coloring is spot on. He even captured her intangible qualities: personality, heart and soul. To say I'm pleased is a complete understatement. The whole experience was great.\nI would not hesitate to get another tattoo from Eddie or to highly recommend him. \nThank you Eddie, Jane",1
3727,"So, I think this should really be 4.5 but I'll round up:). A newbie to the Charlotte restaurant scene, The Summit Room has jumped on the farmhouse-chic train with metal chairs, exposed wood beams, and antler mounts. It's a great vibe, perfect for a gals night out, a date, or happy hour. On the smallish side, cozy and a bit loud because of the close quarters. Cute, outdoor porch that overlooks East Blvd. and Dilworth. Yes, I suppose this place may be a little on the girly side.b\n\nThey have a list of 7 specialty cocktails that are all $11 and named after the seven summits--a cute touch I thought. I opted for beer and was happy to find a decent-sized list of local and regional craft brews. The menu consists of soups/salads, starters and share plates, and larger plates. They also provide mini cheesy scones in lieu of rolls. YUM! \n\nWe sampled the chicken flatbread ($12) with chimichurri grilled chicken, spinach goat cheese, confit oyster mushrooms, tomatoes, cilantro. DOUBLE YUM! Decent sized portion and a unique twist of flavors.\n\nNext up the mussels. Lots of mussels. To be fair the mussels were definitely on the smaller size but they were perfectly cooked and delicious. Mussels came accompanied by toasted bread to dip in the buttery broth.\n\nLastly, to end on a sweet note, we ordered the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e which was served with fresh fruit and absolutely delectable.\n\nOne thing I wasn't impressed with was our server. A little slow, didn't seem to really know the menu, and mixed up the bill a few times. Not terrible, per say, but definitely not notable.",1
3728,"Oh my gosh Nola - now when this place opened everyone talked about it and loved it and raved and I never went. Finally this weekend I got the chance to experience and I thought it was great. The wine selection (which was what I wanted) was great and to be honest I just wanted some pasta so when they turned out to have pasta I was a happy camper. I very much recommend the dish I had, the Pasta Pontchartrain. There was a little kick to the sauce and the meat and crawfish in the dish were perfect.  Everyone in my party had a great meal - I'm pretty sure the grit cakes were called the best meal my dining partner had ever had. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and the environment was fun -I'm going to go ahead and highly recommending trying this place.",1
3729,"No... just no. We're trying to find a few pieces of furniture and I was told by a friend to check this place out. We walk in and are attacked by a salesman. I tell him straight out we are ONLY looking. We will NOT be purchasing today. But still he follows us around like a puppy and then was telling us how he's new and he has to follow us but he doesn't want to be one of those pushy salesmen. Omg... just go away. Biggest turn off ever. Then he starts telling us his life story and too much information about his personal life. Wth? Dude, seriously, go away, I don't care about your back problems! We took one lap around that store with our new human-puppy-man and got the hell out of there. Never again. Never ever again.",0
3730,"Hands down the best service in town!\n\nWe were regulars here for a long time (only stopped coming after moving far away). The staff is amazing and the subs are fresh and delicious. We usually get the veggie.  Their bread is lovely and the veggie's great, especially with lots of red wine vinegar. \n\nLove this place!!",1
3731,"DH dropped off some pants for dry cleaning.  When we got them back one pant wasn't even cleaned.  For the price this isn't something you can overlook.  When we brought it to their attention they fixed it promptly, but were unapologetic about it.  Plus we had to wait another 4-5 days.  I won't be back",0
3732,"We have found Sprouts to be one of the best green grocers in the area, though at times, as others have mentioned the prices can be on the high sign.  \n\nThat said, this is a good location although you sometimes need to fight the traffic from neighboring Chompie's and Starbucks.  The produce is always fresh and you can get those hard to find items for those more unusually recipes here.    I also like their cheese selection and sometimes make a trip just for that.\n\nThe staff has always been very helpful and we enjoy shopping here.  But this is not our weekly grocery, since we too are mindful of the prices that are not on special that week.",1
3733,"Ok.  So what can I say that all the other reviewers haven't said?  This place is pretty terrible.  We know that yelp never lets us down, so I'm not sure why we tried this terribly reviewed place.  We knew someone who went and said that it wasn't so bad.  Despite our reservations (we usually never eat at a poorly reviewed restaurant) we decided to give it a try.  The place was pretty busy on a Wednesday evening.  They were offering happy hour and $5 martinis.  I ordered the raspberry martini and it was really tasty.  However, thats where the positive ends.  They gave us corn bread muffins to snack on while we waited which were barely ok.  We ordered the barbacoa burrito and supreme nachos.  Kids had the been and cheese burrito and chicken fingers.  The barbacoa burrito was so awful, we could barely eat any of it.  The barbacoa was flavorless as was everything else they stuffed in.  The nachos were just ok.  Nothing I would ever need to go back for.  Plus, they were very expensive.  $10 for a small personal sized nacho?  $4 more to upsize it to an entree size.  The kids been and cheese burrito was pretty good, but my son couldn't even eat 2 bites of the chicken fingers.  Hubby tried a bite of them and couldn't blame our son for not eating more.  They were disgusting.  We don't feel the need to ever return.  I just wish it was still El Jefe's......",0
3734,"My husband and I recently stayed at the Buttes and were looking forward to a great dinner at Top of the Rock.  What a disappointment!  We dined on a Sunday night when the restaurant was almost completely empty (there were only 7 couples the entire night, including us) and were seated far away from the window and any chance of a view.  Perhaps an empty restaurant left the staff feeling less than excited about work, as service was mediocre at best.  My husband ordered the beef short ribs, which was a fairly decent dish.  Unfortunately, I ordered the pork tenderloin.  The pork was so salty that I couldn't even finish it, and the overpowering garlic in the accompanying side of creamed barley ensured it remained mostly untouched on my dish.  We left without a single goodbye, feeling as unappreciated upon exit as we did upon arrival.  If you're looking for a nice dinner, save your money and go to Kai or Ko'Sin at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Hotel!",0
3735,"\""""Excuse me waiter, there's a fly in my soup! A FLY IN MY SOUP!\"""", nope, not just in children's books, it happened to me-- EW.\n\nSandwiches were my go-to meal at this location when I would come visit but this particular day I had hankering for some Pho, so I ordered it, husband had a sandwich and the kid had the same thing that I did.\n\nThe soup was flavorless, bland and tasted as though it were 3 days old and they were just reheating it in the microwave. To make matters worse (here's the kicker!) there was a fly in my soup. When we called over the waiter he asked me \"""" Was it in the soup or was it flying around?\"""", SERIOUSLY, does it fucking matter?! He was gracious, apologized and did take it off my bill but what he said was a dip shit thing to say. At one point I wanted to say \""""No Dude, I carry a baggie of flies in my purse to put into soup when they taste like shit to give it some flavor\"""". Boy, you so stupid.\n\nReturn visits are still questionable... The sandwiches, in the past, were amazing, but how will I know if my meal will be \""""bug-free\""""?\n\nWhomp, whomp, whomp-- FAIL.",0
3736,"Came here to try it for the first time. Service was really nice and fast. Even helped cook our meat sometimes. We got the $15.95. All good cause it was pretty good stuff. The brisket is good. Salad is pretty good. I like the flavor. Steamed egg was tasty. Their rice is nice and hot. Marinated spicy chicken was unique and yummy. Kimchi was really good and cold. Water was always refilled quickly without asking. They know how to do work here! Got the check and was confused why it was more expensive than we thought. We just decided to pay for it anyways. When we went to the cashier I saw on the menu it said they automatically ass gratuity to all parties 5 or less 15% or more 18%. Then out loud I said \""""oh babe that's why, they already charged us for gratuity.\"""" She looked at us and looked concerned and I replied \""""sorry it was our first time here.\"""" And then she was quick to apologize and say \""""oh I'm sorry I didn't know usually our customers know so we don't say anything..\"""" And I said it was fine. She was really nice about it and I can tell it was a genuine response. The place is cute and clean too. Thumbs up to Korean garden! Now I know why people go here.",1
3737,"Love the decor - and it smells fantastic in here! \n\nI ordered the corn & shrimp soup (was a bit disappointed that they didn't have their chili - that's what I REALLY wanted to try) and a chocolate pecan cookie to go. I paid a total of $9.16, which seems really steep for what I got, but I figured that if the food was super yummy, that maybe it would be worth it! \n\nWell.....the soup is really just so-so. In fact, it really tasted like bland corn chowder - the shrimp was incredibly overpowered, and added no flavor whatsoever! I searched our break room for some sort of spice, pepper - ANYTHING, but to no avail! Darn:P Honestly, I wish I had ordered something else - a swing and an epic miss! \n\nOn the up side, it came with four slices of fresh, soft french bread, which was perfect for dipping. The bread gets an A+ from me! (which is great news, because it IS a French bakery, after all...!)\n\nThe cookie never even made it to the end of the meal. That bad boy was finished before I even got to the office. Super, super delish! I might even go back for a few more of these to bring to the office. You should also bring some (for me, that is). \n\nDidn't get any coffee, but I LOVE Peet's coffee, so next time I'm so stopping there for my morning brew. \n\nWill I come here again? Yes. I WILL have that buffalo soup. It shall be mine - oh yes, it shall be mine. \n\nThe staff was friendly, I was greeted kindly as soon as a customer in front of me was finished with their order, but the girl who brought out my food wouldn't look me in the eye. She probably was afraid to lose her soul, so I can understand that. I'd be afraid, too. \n\nTo sum it up, meh - but that doesn't stop me from going back.",0
3738,"Eh... The food is eh... I had a chicken breast with a sauce that tasted like the curry dressing from Jolly Bob's. The appetizer was eh. The service was eh. The beer that's available is decent, but not as good as the one they were out of... They can do so much better with the food. It's faux imaginative.",0
3739,"I finally got a chance to taste what everyone has been talking about! Really fresh food, really good food and lots of it. \n\nI had the veggie quesadilla, a side of beans and a roasted jalapeno. The veggie quesadilla was simple - cheese, avocado, lettuce and peppers - but it was still tasty. I'm a sucker for beans, and although these weren't the best I'd ever had, they were still really good. I chopped up the jalapeno and added it to the beans. \n\nThe 3.5 star rating that America's Taco Shop currently has (as of the beginning of January 2011) is not at all representative of the food and service that you'll get at the Shop. Go anyway, eat and be happy!",1
3740,"Do not go here for late night dinner hours. They stay open until 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays however, I went around 10:15pm, and by then they had stopped making any type of fresh food.  \nThe beans were being scraped from the bottom of the tin and there was little to no guacamole; so the worker pulled a tin of turned-brown guacamole from the fridge storage and tried to scrape the brown part off the top and mix it with what was left and then added a little salsa for some sort of half-assed leftovers. By the time I'd seen the \""""guacamole\"""" she was going to give me I was about ready to leave but just declined it altogether. (And they still had 45 minutes of service left.) \n\nDear Cafe Rio, \nDon't stay open late if you can't serve your customers the same as if they had been there at 5pm (which I have several times before). My late night meal was not \""""a masterpiece.\""""\n\nI'll be going to Zaba's or Chipotle for a freshly made late night dinner from now on.",0
3741,"Just awful customer service, really disappointing.\n\nI made a reservation here a month before our visit - we were 20 strong, a soccer team in town for a tournament.  I was the first to arrive, and the hostess said to let her know when we had 10 there, and she'd seat us.  When 10 arrived, I let her know.  They started to lead us to our seats, in the Main Hall as we'd requested.\n\nThen, confusion strikes.  She leads us to a table with people already sitting at it, one of our group says \""""uh...we don't know them...\"""" and she laughs, then realizes he wasn't joking, and says \""""really?  no way!\""""  They claimed that this other group came in and said they were us, so they gave them our table.\n\nHowever, I suspect the true story is that they screwed up and gave another party our table, under no fault of the people sitting at the other table.  My proof?  While we were waiting for our 10 to arrive, I heard them call \""""Leslie, party of 6.\""""  We were Leslie, party of 20.  So, the Leslie party of 6 was seated, then they realized they screwed up and tried to blame them for wrongly taking our seats.  Not cool.\n\nThe manager was involved in all of this, and he is the sole person to blame for the mistake, and the failure to fix the mistake.\n\nThey sent us back to the lobby and made us wait until a table for 20 was open.  By the time we were seated, it was 45 minutes past our reservation time.  We had just played 3 soccer games before going to dinner, and were all more than starving, and grumpy.  It truly sucked.\n\nHe tried telling us that we could just sit in the beer garden if we wanted - anyone who has been here knows that would be lame.  There is no entertainment, and it is not fun like the main hall is.  We came there to party, not have a conversation.\n\nWhat they should have done:  Admitted it was their mistake, not blame some other customers.  Given us free mini-beers while we waited, or at least offered us water or SOMETHING.  Apologized.\n\nThe manager here sucks, I won't be back.  Oh, and our server sucked and was rude to some of the people in our group, but we still had to pay the 18% tip they tacked on.  I hate that rule with a passion you would not believe.",0
3742,"I've been to 7th Heaven twice. The first time, there was a teenage girl working who dismissively said \""""hi\"""" to me and that was it. I was looking at shoes, which they have to get your size for you out of a closet, and she never once asked if she could help me. Terrible. I avoided the place after that.\n\nI went back last week as a last ditch effort since Fascinations had nothing for shoes, and Tiffany was working. She was super, super sweet and helpful. She dug through the closet multiple times for me (I'm extremely picky... so sue me), and upon not finding my size in a style I liked, suggested I at least try one size up in one of the brands; tada, they fit! Woohoo! She was even genuinely happy that they fit and that I could leave with a pair of shoes.\n\nAs Kelly said, they do give 15% off for dancers and offer a shoe warranty for $4, where they'll repair your soles or heels. This is a steal since shoes are $50+ and the soles often wear out in 6 months, and unless you looooove blisters, who really wants to buy a new pair and have to break them in all over again? \n\nMinus one star only because they have kind of a limited selection of dresses and like everywhere else, are usually out of stock on 7/8/9s in shoes.",0
3743,"The location is convenient considering I live in North Las Vegas. The drinks were good but they're overpriced. The amount you pay for a large is the same as the biggest boba drink at No.1 Boba. Except the size of a large at Tea Time is the same as a medium at No.1 Boba. And the regular sized boba should be called small, not regular. They were good but not worth it to me.",0
3744,"This is supposed to be a non-smoking hotel, but they let guests smoke on the balconies. Second-hand smoke is sucked into the through-the-wall air conditioning units and  your room smells like smoke. There is nothing management can do except give you a free breakfast, if you complain. Sad.",0
3745,Paws down the best kennel I have boarded my dog at! I've left Max at various kennels while on vacation and he has never come home so happy as he did from the Foothill Per Resort. I could tell he was given a lot of attention and exercised enough since he wasn't out of control and needy when I picked him up.\n\nSome of the other places I've taken him (ex: Canine Country Club near the airport) have been a terrible experience  for him  and he's come home a total wreck losing hair and seriously needy and anxious. Not this time! It's worth a few extra bucks a night to know he'll be as happy and loved and when he's at home.,1
3746,What a beautiful location! It's actually very much like the Venetian in Macau.\n\nThe shops are beautiful and spread out. Even the jewelry stores make you feel like you should stop and take pictures.\n\nThere are about 27 restaurants and if you take your time you will find some real great locations.\n\nHave fun! You won't be disappointed.,1
3747,"The food was good, the service was horrendous. Our waitress Carroll  literally kept forgetting about us. Took forever to even come to our table to take our drink order.

The service is top notch, the place is immaculately clean, and the prices are what you would expect. The only even slight complaint I have is that they do not have fountain soda, but rather plastic bottles of soda instead. But I really like this place.",1
3749,"I don't know how this place has 4 stars. I've given it a try a couple times since it's near UNLV and cheaper than most AYCE places but nothing redeems this place of how below-average the sushi and service is. This place is crowded often but don't let it fool you, it's in a crowded area plus it's near the strip. The sushi is terrible. Their rice is always falling apart and the fish never tastes fresh. Plus their service is flat out rude. And if you don't want to take my word for it then take the Health District's word for it. THEY GOT CLOSED IN JUNE TWICE FOR FAILING THEIR HEALTH INSPECTION. And have gotten numerous C's in the past, many times getting over 30 demerits. Google it.\n\nThe last time I went, when my friend and I arrived the hostess seemed peeved we were waiting for the rest of our party. We didn't even insist we sit down at a table but she had attitude about us waiting. When we got to our table it was 2:50 and they tried to charge us dinner prices which we had to fight them about. (And who wants to do that?) If your menu has lunch prices till 3PM then it's lunch prices till 3PM. Its not a hard concept. It's not like a buffet where we are trying to get lunch prices for a dinner buffet..it's the same shiz.  One last person arrived at 2:59 and they made a stink that HE absolutely had to pay the dinner price. Okay fine, take your extra 3 dollars you crazy people.\n\nThen we ate and I definitely didn't eat my moneys worth. Sushi looks like it's from a grocery store. Nothing special, tastes old.\n\nI'm sorry but when your sushi is gross don't be so determined to charge the higher price. They were rude about the whole process too and like I said, the sushi sucks.  The first time I went there they started bringing rolls no one ordered and when we said that they argued with us then and put it on our table anyway. This business does not know how to pick their battles or treat their customers. It's scary going to a sushi place like this because they WILL argue you for more money, even when they're clearly in the wrong. \n\nSakana across the street is much better and relatively the same prices.",0
3750,"Yupha's is my favorite Thai restaurant in the Phoenix metro. My husband and I have been coming here for 3 or 4 years now, and we've never had a bad meal or bad service.

I usually order the chicken pad Thai because I love it so much, but I've also had the pad garlic sauce, drunken noodles, boat noodle, and yellow curry. The lunch menu also includes all you can eat soup and salad, which are both very good. We've been in for Valentine's Day and Mother's Day before, and they usually have nice special occasion menus.",1

You have crazy toppings like Captain Crunch, fruity pebbles, cocoa pebbles, granola, mango, blueberry, banana, strawberry, etc...I guess the owner or manager overheard me because I'm loud.

3754,"Totally disappointed. This was my 4th time eating here and quite possibly my last. \n\nFirst, I ordered the speciality fried rice (The server described it as \""""the white fried rice and not the dark\"""") It came with chopped pork, chicken and whole shrimp. The shrimp had their intestinal tracks still intact. The chicken was really dry which makes me think they used old leftover pre cooked chicken. And the rice was hard and some pieces were crunchy. When fried rice gets stuck in my teeth, it's not good fried rice. \n\nI also ordered the rare beef Pho. When the server brought the plate of Jalapenos, bean sprouts, and thai basil, the jalapenos were dry and rotting, the basil came wilted and had a lot of brown spots. I asked her to change it out and she did. \n\nUsually whenever I get Pho, it comes steaming hot. Since I only saw little puff of steam, I knew I was in trouble. I went to stir it and the noodles on the bottom were still clumped together, and a small ice cube was in the noodles! I pulled it out and kept stirring the Pho to loosen the noodles. Usually when I get the rare beef, the soup cooks it because its so hot. Not this time... After I tasted it, I called the server over and asked her if she could warm it up in the microwave because it was luke warm. After 15 mins, the little old lady in the back came out with the Pho and said that if I order rare beef it will stay rare. I told her that was fine, but I didnt want cold soup. \n\nWhen I got the Pho back, I could tell she just boiled the hell out of it because it was full of floaters from the cooked blood from the rare beef. It just looked disgusting. I couldnt eat it, and asked for my check. Instead of making things better, the server just gave me the check and I paid 25.00 for NOTHING. (I did drink my Thai tea)  \n\nThere was a total lack of service. There was only one other person during my entire visit. Nobody ever really checked on my table. And it was hard to get the servers attention when I needed something.\n\n\nI am really surprised at the quality of the food, because their sister restaurant Da Lat is outstanding. I thnk the manager or chef at Da Lat needs to pay Jasmine a visit....",0

Both were cooked spot on temp wise and super juicy and tasty. \n\nShe said the best burger she can recall and I second that.",1
3756,"I eat here at least twice a month. It's very authentic and delicious. The staff is extremely friendly and really seem to love what they do. Their hummus is very smooth and more middle eastern in flavor (more tahini and less garlic) than what one would find at a Greek restaurant, which I prefer. They have the best baba in the city. Perfectly smoked. \nAlso good are the gyro salad, lamb kabobs and grilled chicken. Entrees are served on a wonderfully spiced rice. Ask for a side of yogurt sauce for dipping. It's so good. Also very authentic. The falafel is great, made from scratch, to order. \nIf you are lucky enough to eat at Eden's for lunch, they have some great specials. \nSave some room for dessert. Last time we were there, we lucked out and got some baklava right out of the oven...heaven.",1
3757,"Cox Communications is a dishonest, arrogant, self serving, expensive company that I tell everyone to avoid. They're advertisements are pure lies as to what you get when purchasing a service.  They're price discounts last for only a short period of time and then you get hit with the full price which they hide and don't disclose.  They make you buy bundles of crap TV channels in order to get the few channels you want.  They have recently improved their broadband internet speeds, because Centurylink is bringing in fiber 1 gig, but before that, you couldn't get anywhere near the advertised speed.  The only reason they're still in business is because they bribe the local elected officials with massive campaign contributions to keep competition out, and advertise intensely, especially that they gave a pittance to a local charity. They block access to sites they don't want you to go to because they're not their business cronies, and they give preferential speed to their cronies, and lie about it to cover it up.

3758,Zipps is my favorite place to watch a game on Mill Ave. It's always fun to come here on game day for ASU home or away games and it's great for Sunday football. I also come here to watch my hometown teams play because they more than likely have the game on one of their many TVs. The food is great as well. I love the buffalo wings and any of the focaccia sandwiches are delicious. The only negative thing I'd have to say is that the service is a little slow sometimes.

I really really liked the mustard that came with as well.\n* grilled salmon = pretty good but also pretty standard\n* steak salad thing = This is more steak than salad but it was very good.  The steak strips were cooked perfectly and made a great addition to the salad.  The salad itself was very good and had a very flavorful and complementary dressing.\n* French Fries = excellent!!  Freshly made and perfectly cooked.  LOVE the salt.  HATED the homemade ketchup - it was like marinara sauce mixed with BBQ sauce.  No bueno.\n\nI was expecting crappy service because of what the reviews said on here, but it was actually quite good.  The place was pretty dead so the staff would be hard pressed to NOT be attentive.\n\nAll-in-all it was a pretty good meal and dining experience.  I wouldn't rush back because it isn't really that special of a place, BUT if the other places in the Quarter are too jam-packed; I would return.",1
3762,"We tried this place due to yelp.   We were impressed with the atmosphere as it has beautiful art hangings and the place is clean.  I ordered the guacho burrito and the horchata due to the yelpster's recommendations. I usually don't go for beef so I wasn't crazy about the burrito, but it was good.   I was freaking crazy about the Horchata though!  I am a salsa snob so it takes a lot to impress me.   Rule number one - it must cause burn or don't call it salsa.   The seven chiles was so good that there wasn't much left at the salsa bar.   What was left, I took!  Second best salsa was the salsa peanut!  It was creamy, hot, flavorful and the best salsa peanut I have ever had!  So happy that they serve real salsas. My only recommendation for them would be to improve on the chips.   The chips are a bit thin, but cover them with salsa and all will be alright. When in Phoenix-go to this place.   It's a bit small, but hang in there and grab a seat and set your tongue on fire then cool it down with the horchata!",1
3763,"VERY RUDE FRONT DESK STAFF! DO NOT STAY AT PH!\n\nDuring my checkout I saw they charge me resort fee $5.99 per night and that was not mentioned on my offer when I booked it online.

3764,"I've eaten here many times since it opened years ago.  I loved my first visit so much, I took my Mom and her husband for dinner there a few days later!  His fave meal there is the buffalo meatloaf w/ saut\u00e9ed mushroom gravy w/ sides of parmesan mashed potatoes and spiced pecan green beans.  LOVE the spiced pecan green beans!!  My Mom and I adore the seafood entrees served here; she especially loves the tempura-battered shrimp w/ tortilla slaw, FANTASTIC mango haba\u00f1ero chutney and huge steak fries.  I regularly order the pecan crusted trout, w/c comes w/ cilantro peach salsa and tortilla slaw.  While the peach salsa is so tasty and the slaw delicious and marvelously crunchy, my  allergies prevent me from enjoying them, so I always ask for substitutions of mango habanero chutney and spiced pecan green beans, the latter being so sinfully good!!  [According to the restaurant's online nutrtitional guide, It's also calorific AND loaded w/ saturated fat, but hey, I don't smoke tobacco or \""""creative\"""" cigs, nor do drugs, and I rarely drink (yeah, what fun am I to have around, eh?), so I allow myself occasional splurges w/ certain foods!  So you see, my allergies are blessings of sorts...]\n\nIn the appetizers menu, the lobster spinach queso, coconut shrimp, chicken quesadilla, CRABCAKES, and chicken tortilla soup are all scrumptious!  (Yes, I enjoyed many of these items before I learned that the awful cramps and other seemingly crazy and non-sequential symptoms I'd experience afterwards were caused by food allergies!)\n\nDesserts here are also pretty amazing.  Try their seasonal bread puddings!!  I've tried two versions- one w/ white chocolate and another w/ liquors of dark chocolate and bourbon, perhaps?  I also enjoy a few appetizers offered at half-price during happy hour: buffalo wings, sliders w/ french fries, onion rings, and RIBS!  If you like citrus-y beverages, try Firebirds' signature martini, the Double Black Diamond- fresh pineapple steeped in citrus vodka and garnished w/ a pineapple slice!  \n\nI did make a phone call about a month ago and found that HH appetizer selections have changed to reflect the seasons, so you may want to call ahead if you're like me and suffer from food allergies...\n\nLast, but not least, while table and bar services here can be very spotty, management usually does a fine job w/ follow-ups and corrections.  I also enjoy the ambience here... reminds me of wonderful childhood memories of summers spent in Baguio, the summer capital of Luzon.  Woods, everywhere!  Beams, tables, chairs, floors, restrooms...  There's even a nice fireplace!",1
3765,"We went here for the first time today. The ambiance is very nice - not too formal, but a nice selection of regular tables and high tables. They were testing out some new wines today so we got to sample 4 wines and give them feedback on them (no charge! (for the wine or our feedback:) ).  We split 2 dishes. She got the falafel platter. The falafel's were done to perfection - nicely toasted on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. They were very tasty as well - not bland at all. I had the gyro flatbread. The meat was tasty and tender. We made the mistake of getting the baklava for desert - which we couldn't stop eating - so we were stuffed! The baklava was honey sweet - but not so wet that the honey was dripping. And was very nutty tasting. All in all a great experience and we'll definitely go back.",1
3766,"I only give one star because there is not an option for zero star. I'm a Brazilian from Curitiba. I tried this place about 3 times across the last 6 years. Each time the place had a different owner and we were told things would improve. They need to burn this place down and start all over. It was terrible each time! Please don't waste money, time at this place. Zero quality, poor service! Nothing Brazilian about this place. Fogo de Chao is the best Brazilian restaurant in town at the moment. Fogo de chao is worth every penny, not this place. Food was cold, the food tasted and looked old. Nothing positive to say. I like to enjoy good fresh food and nothing about this place was good to me.

As we were eating, the place filled up very quickly so keep that in mind.  \nThe menu was varied with both pub foods, salads and entrees- I really enjoyed the Amy's salad and I'm not really a fan of spinach but it was delish.  The veggie sandwich was likewise satisfying and the service was just fine.  Overall, we were impressed and will plan to return often.",1
3769,I used to love this place and because I moved out of the area I havent been back here in over a year until today. When they brought my food out I almost laughed at the portion size. You used to get WAY more food for your money here. The prices havent changed to be consistent with the portions either...will not go back.,0
3770,"You can do yourself a huge favor and have all required documents in order before you arrive. You will find that this will speed up your time here. Also, call them and ask questions before you drive here. For some things you may not need to actually go to the DMV and can do it through the mail. If you must come here, I recommend coming early. Almost never on a Friday though!! Super crazy on Friday's!!",1
3771,"I stumbled upon this place because my cousin told me we should try it.  We always have been going to Monta since it was one of the places for Ramen that we liked.  The only problem with them that it is way too salty for my taste plus the place was so tiny I felt so claustrophobic.  I am not one for cramped spaces.  \n\nMy husband is an especially picky eater, especially with Asian food, but he loves this.  I think he finally found a place that he cannot get sick of.  They offer such a variety of food that you cannot go wrong.  I love the ambiance of the restaurant.  Very cozy and casual.\n\nThe staff is on point when it comes to filling our drinks.  That is one of my biggest peeves is when the servers do not fill my drinks on a timely manner, but they do and I love it!  They are seriously on point when it comes to greeting us when we first come in.  \n\nMy usual order is the Tonkotsu Asari.  Thank you BTW for not making salty.  I have a sensitive palatte so I am glad that you are able to add flavor without making me an enormous amounts of water.  My husband gets the Tonkotsu Spicy which he makes super hot.  It looks delicious, but I do not do spicy foods.  I think you guys made me a lover for the Takoyaki (Octopus Balls) and the Pork Chashu Bowl.  Yum!  \n\nThis is definitely a place that we can eat with our friends and family.  My husband, cousin, and I are going to be regulars here.  People should seriously try this place out.  I cannot rave enough about this place.",1
3772,"Gave this places another shot after feeling pretty dissatisfied the first time. Second time I left with same ripped off grossed out feeling. I love gourmet burgers, but there's something about this place that grosses me out. I love all kinds of ethnic food, so it's not the Asian twist on the burgers I'm talking about. If you want a delicious gourmet style burger go to Gordon Ramsay Burgr in planet Hollywood. It's about the same price too!",0
3773,"Excellent service, and very friendly staff. The coffee is excellent, and the espresso is pulled on a gorgeous vintage machine (it's beautiful if you appreciate fine coffee, and adds to the atmosphere) The owner told me the whole story behind the espresso machine, and was super friendly.\n\nI believe there's wifi if you're working, and there's a great little patio outside when the weather is nice.\n\nIt's a homey feeling place. Not too big or loud. One of the coffee gems in Kitchener Waterloo.\n\nIf you're driving, there is a lot across the street, but it's hit or miss whether you'll find a spot. You can also park on the road nearby.",1
3774,"The hairdressers are all very young and inexperienced, with no older folk to guide them or show them how to cut hair.  I tried to explain how my ends need to be cut, but neither of the two employees had ever heard of such a thing.  I have had this certain type of cut from a few different hairdressers, and it's perfect for my type of hair.  I have had some other hairdressers insist on something else, and it always looks horrid.  I am open to certain changes, permutations, and differences here and there, but there is a specific way that the ends of my hair really need to be cut.\n\nSo anyway, the two kids get together and decide that I'm crazy, and they convince me to let them do it \""""the right way\"""".  I have to admit that it's my fault because it was Sunday afternoon, and I didn't feel like waiting for an appointment with a better establishment.  I just asked them to leave like an extra inch, just in case I needed to cut more to make it right.  They ended up giving me a very stupid-looking cut.  I actually had to cut it some more when I got home.  My home-cut involved standing backwards in front of a large mirror, holding a smaller mirror in my left hand, and using the scissors with my right hand.\n\nLuckily, the skill level of the hairdresser was so low that there was not much for me to mess up.  It's just a straight line across the back.  Nothing was done to the sides, and she did not create a shape of any type along the back.  I paid thirty bucks with tip for a straight line that goes right across my back.  I could have gotten my boyfriend to do it.",0
3775,"I don't get the appeal of this place.  It's dirty, the food is terrible and ordering is a huge hassle.  They only take cash.  I get that it's a rustic, touristy place, but I can't figure out how the health department hasn't shut it down.  \n\nI ordered a burger.  After waiting 30 minutes my number was still not called.  I went to the counter to see why it was taking so long and they pretended that they called my number already and my food was sitting there waiting for me.  Since it was ice cold I asked if they could warm it up.  They took it away, disappeared out of site with it, and returned a couple seconds later with a still freezing burger. My assumption is that did something to the burger, but they weren't warming it up...\n\nThe place is just a dump.  The owners are sitting on millions of dollars in land.  They should consider selling it so that no one else has to get food poisoning from this pit.",0
3776,"We went there for lunch, figured it would be nice to eat in one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, even if it's a cheaper one (well, not really, let's say cheap for Vegas...). So, right off the bat, looking at the menu, I knew there was no way I was going to pay 27$ for fish and chips. Maybe they're really good, but like most things in Vegas I'm sure they're not worth the price. And the same can be said for most of the menu, like 22$ for bangers and mash or for a chicken pot pie. I don't think so. \n\nSo we went for less expensive items: Deviled eggs, Mac & cheese and Duck confit poutine. The deviled eggs (2) we're tasty, but not worth the 8$. They were my idea; my girlfriend didn't see anything special about them. She enjoyed her mac & cheese but it was too salty. Now the duck confit poutine, oh boy... First off, my poutine had very little of everything, very little duck, very little cheese, and very little sauce in the little cup on the side. So, it's mostly just 12$ for fries with a bit of toppings on them. The fries themselves? Not even very good, a good fry you can taste the potato still, not these. They didn't even seem homemade. \n\nMr. Ramsay, if you're going to serve poutine in one of your restaurants, I'd suggest coming here, to Qu\u00e9bec City, and seeing what real poutine is. I can take you to a few dozen places, easily, that serve better poutine, and I'm talking anything from little shacks on the side of the road serving the traditionnal kind, to french bistros with a delicious twist on this classic. In fact, I could take you about an hour and a half outside QC city, to a small roadside restaurant where a culinary trained couple is doing lobster poutine, bison burgers, and more, oh and the best duck confit poutine anywhere. Tons of really good duck, tons of very fresh cheese curds, an amazing sauce and some of the best fries you'll ever eat. And it's definitely less than 12$US. Of course, for us the drive there ends up raising the price of that poutine somewhat, still worth every penny though. Unfortunately I can't say the same about the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill. I sincerely doubt you can get your money's worth for anything there.",0

This show definitely leans towards the sexual side of things. You can see two topless women swim around in a giant fishbowl together down at the local dive joint on college nights, but CDS takes that and adds not only acrobatics but a sensual vibe to it.

3781,"This place was pretty junk. It wasn't so much the decor or the ambience, but rather the staff and the people.  Uh, apparently this place is a restaurant. No clue, I'm talking about the lounge/club.\n\nFirst, it wasn't very busy when we went on a Friday night, and the people who were there looked like they were not having any fun either. They probably got recruited by the various Mandalay Bay properties like the restaurants that promise you free cover if you bring the receipt, or the solicitors on the main floor handing out cards also offering free cover. Well no shit there's free cover, there isn't anybody inside! One of the staff approached us and offered us bottle service for a deal (forget the price) so we accepted, why the hell not it was cheaper than buying at the bar. We had our own little sitting area that was completely empty. This dude acted like he was doing us the biggest favour in the world to be sitting there. He later sends us some girls over who are just looking to get some free drinks from us. They were beautiful, sure, but seriously? I know it's Vegas and everything but come on! We shooed them away and off they went to the only other table in our area with people at it, who were hooting and hollering them over. They chatted with the guys, got their free drinks, then took off making out with various random dudes and getting free drinks along the way. Then off they vanished never to be seen again... The end.\n\nThe patio outside has a really nice view, filled with a lot of not happy looking people as well. Probably felt ripped off because maybe they paid cover? We'll never know.",0

The instructor demonstrated to the class what she wanted us to do, and would quietly explain finer points in English to me by the mat, which was loaned to me and all the props I needed.

3789,"I was here about 2 Saturday's ago alone as I was looking around for a restaurant to eat.  The only French restaurant I have ever eaten in Edinburgh is La Garrigue.  The chef, waitress & manager were all French which I thought was a good sign.  I was expecting the same quality but unfortunately I was wrong.  The managers and waitress were all very polite and well mannered.  It is unfortunate that the food quality was just mediocre and average.  I mistakenly chose a 3 course set meal for dinner as opposed to lunch but the manager was very kind and talked to the kitchen staff and they were willing to prepare the dinner set for me.  I am unsure if the limited time to get ready the dinner food before dinner actually affected the quality of the food.  If that was the case then they should have said no to me ordering the dinner during lunch.  I had Baked scallops served \u00e0 la Proven\u00e7ale as the starter.  The scallops were fresh and delicately prepared but the roasted peppers that came with it tasted like they were from the jars.  I had Duck legs with ratatouille, roast garlic and tapenade sauce as the main.  The duck was a bit tough for a leg dark meat and seems like they were deep fried from as opposed to properly prepared French style.  The worst was actually the desert.  The Creme Brulee tasted like a thick custard and not a proper Creme Brulee.  I judge French food by their Creme Brulee but this not Creme Brulee so it felt like I actually have nothing French to judge in this restaurant.  I have been to France for food and yes, the chef is French but quality is really not up to French scratch.  A bit of a let down.  The only pro is that the waitress & manager were very nice to me.

3794,"After finding an offer on one stop for First Food and Bar, I purchased the certificate and had high expectations dining here. We arrived at the Palazzo for lunch because on one stop, it showed that lunch would be available; however, on a Thursday, the kitchen was closed. So buyer beware! Check the hours of the establishment always. I decided to use Open Table to create a reservation for Friday, 5P dining for 3 (2 adults and a 17 mo old) to ensure the kitchen would be open. Upon arrival at First Food and Bar, we were greeted and seated wth menus. The decor offered a cool hipster vibe and I felt like my expectations were going to be met. Our waiter took our drink order and after 2 false starts for beer because the keg needing \""""tapping\"""", he finally brought a soda and beer to the table. After showing the one stop restaurant.com certificate, the waiter took it to the back and came back with our appetizer of soft pretzel sticks. Our meal was so-so. The KFC Pork Chop was cooked to discombobulating medium rare. After watching various cooking shows where this is acceptable, I decided to keep the chop at the table. The medium cooked part of the chop was tasty. The frosted flake crust offered a nice crunch. The grilled peach that accompanied the chop was overdone and not sweet. If the plate had been executed better - medium cooked chop and a sweet grilled peach to go with the cream, then this would have been a fine dish. The Lamb Osso Bucco was a big portion. The lamb was tender and the eggplant couscous was very flavorful and spicy. A bit more raita would have been great to bring this dish home. The childrens menu is de riguer and the chicken nuggets and fries were pretty good. Overall the meal was fine. But the service was not. The waiter dropped off the check which was $95. Typically, with restaurant.com certificated the servers ALWAYS go over the bill and show how the discount was applied and to ensure the customer sees the gratuity that was added. This time no. My husband dropped $120 on the bill and the waited asked if we needed change and my husband said No. Then, the waiter never came back. No follow up on the receipt of the meal, no follow up on drink refills or additional drinks...nothing, except another guy looking at the table waiting for our departure to bus. So we left. About 50 feet outside of the restaurant, the restaurant.com issue stuck with me and I went back inside to ask the waiter if he applied the $25 off. He simply said Yes. No show on the reciept...nothing. In effect, this guy made off with an 18% gratuity automatically applied because of the restaurant.com with an additional 26% gratuity from my husband -- and no, he did not provide 44% in gratuity level of service. Lastly, open table contacted me to advise that I was a NO SHOW on the reservation. Very troubling that even the hostess couldn&apos;t confirm an open table reservation. Thereby, erasing the whole dining incident from the records -- no reservation confirmation and no credit card swipe on the bill.",0
3795,"My wife and I just stopped at the Dairy Queen on central on our way home. I got the pumpkin pie blizzard. I was giddy like a school girl. There were tiny hairs all over my entire blizzard. It was repulsive. I will never go there again, and this is depressing, because Dairy Queen in Philly was a high school hang out for me.",0
3796,I love this place!! The food is always fantastic. The clam chowder is the best. I don't think I've ever had anything disappointing at this place. The service is fantastic. Who would have guessed that Bangers and Mash could be so good. I would recommend the Monaghan Meatloaf. It is full of rosemary and devine. The Kinvara Salmon is also a very wonderful dish. We go as often as we can.,1
3797,"The side of sauteed Spinach was incredibly salty otherwise the color was wonderful and it smelled great. The side of sauteed mushrooms looked really good, but they were way too peppery. I never season my food, when its cooked right there isn't any need to but whoever made those dishes had a very heavy hand. I NEVER leave food behind and I didn't even finish half of them. \n\nI had to ask for a steak knife. Waited until someone bothered to make eye contact with me to ask for it by the way. The steak was cooked perfectly - rare just the way I like it and the texture wonderful. The thin french fries were great too, very good! Flavor, texture etc. but as I ate the steak there was way too much seasoning on it as well. Seasoning shouldn't over power the flavor of a good cut of meat and this did. \n\nThe biggest issue I had: the staff really needs a lesson in professionalism. I heard one woman behind me talk about a female condom which was just PART of their conversation. They were all huddled in the back while there were people at tables on the floor. Totally turned me off. I saw waitress and waiter in disagreement in the middle of the dining area while setting up a table. One couple complained they had been sitting there ignored. The gentleman got up and said something to a waiter and the manager came over and appeared to make amends in a grandiose way.  My own waiter walked by and for some reason never made eye contact. I was not sure why  - to be clear I NEVER give anyone a hard time nor am I anything other than friendly. Even if the service and food are not up to par. \n\nI was seated in the back, on the left (if you are facing the kitchens) so had a birds eye view - and ear - to everything. I told one friend that I actually felt like I was in restaurant boss type episode and there was a hidden camera somewhere, it was that ridiculous with the staff and how they were acting. \n\nThe Manager must have realized I heard what I shouldn't have heard because he gave me a box of free pastries and apologized. The staff treated him, quite honestly? - like crap. It was embarrassing. The fact that those kids (some of them - others adults) acted in such a manner in a restaurant that I'd heard NOTHING but rave reviews about? It was disappointing. \n\nThe fact I heard him trying to discipline them - they ignored him - was probably not smart on his part either. He seemed frazzled and angry and just disgusted. Lets just say the atmosphere that night was a 1 star. If the staff acts up like that? Get them in the kitchen and send them home, don't do it where patrons can hear.\n\nIn all fairness maybe (hopefully for the owner) this was not a regular occurrence because friends of mine RAVE about this place. For breakfast and dinner saying it was one of their favorites. I went on a Coupon to try it out, and at first loved the atmosphere but it went downhill from there. I also can't see paying that kind of money for a meal that was \""""eh\"""" \n\nI always eat every bite on my plate and I savor each one. I didn't take anything with me except the free pastries and my french fries. \n\nI judge a place on different criteria and I have a sensitive palate and nose. LOVE food. To cook it, eat it, buy it, read about it etc. I think I am a good judge of what I see, taste, smell and - hear.\n\nI'd recommend other places before this one for DINNER - may consider giving them a shot for breakfast type fare and will say the ONE WONDERFUL thing - the best thing about this place - the desserts. They were a little stale but it was after 9pm so that isn't a biggie in my book. \n\nI bought a slice of Carrot cake and Tiramisu - the waiter had closed my bill without asking me about desserts at all by the way......I watched a waitress across the room RAVE about them to a full table of people ( I was solo) and she had me craving them. He was going to give them to me for free because he closed the bill out. I insisted on paying for them and will tell you that it was \""""THE BEST\"""" carrot cake I've ever had! I'd order a whole one for my birthday cake if I could. \n\nThe free pastries the Manager gave me? Macaroons are awesome almond cakes too and croissants with chocolate in them. I would recommend this place as a BAKERY and I may give them a shot - after hearing a friend say the crepes were really good - for breakfast. However, not my first choice or even second for Dinner. \n\nFor the owner? You have your work cut out for you, I am not a professional in the food service industry but you should consider \""""Restaurant Stakeout\"""" if you find your patronage decline.",0

3799,"I just left a review for Thrifty also.  They're the same company so same crappy service.  I've rented from both...\n\nArrived at the facility and yes there was a VERY FRICKING LONG line.  Only 2 people working behind the counter.  Waited for over 30 minutes and it's my turn.  Sounds like everybody who wrote a review had a similar if not identical experience.  Yes the agent was a jerk.  I made a reservation for a mid size.  I asked him what my choices were and he showed me cars like, oh we have a Chrysler 300,oh we have a Mustang convertible, oh we have a Sienna minivan.  I asked if they cost the same and he was like \""""NO you pay extra\"""".  I made a reservation for a MID SIZE and I wanna know what my quote price would cover.  Is it that hard to understand?  Ok then he told me my price would only cover a class called \""""COROLLA CLASS\"""".  The name says it all.  Toyota Corollas have its own class at Dollar.  That's a fricking COMPACT.  Not mid size ok?  \n\nWhen it got to the insurance part, they're very, like I mean VERY pushy.  I said I'd decline any kind of insurance or services.  I got myself covered from my insurance company and my credit card.  Then he started to asked me what insurance company am I with.  What credit card I'm using.  I told him I'm with American Family and he was like \""""No.. AmFam doesn't cover that.  No AmEx doesn't cover that either.  ARE YOU SURE you're really covered???\""""  I called my insurance agent like 3 times before the trip to confirm that and I even had a letter stating I'm covered with me at that time.  I also called AmEx to confirm and I read the card member agreement thoroughly to make sure I'm covered.  I did my homework alright?  Then that A-hole started to say things like \""""I've been in the car renting business for like 10+ years.  Well MAYBE you know something that I don't eh?\""""  THAT'S WHY YOUR SORRY AZZ IS STILL WORKING BEHIND THE COUNTER AS A STUPID AGENT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS YOU SOB!!!  And he started to say things like how I'm totally financially responsible for any kind of damage and stuff like that, in a threatening tone.  \""""If you got into an accident, you'll be in big trouble\"""".  That's is not true.  I told him I don't care and just get me outta here.  FINALLY!\n\nBasically renting from Dollar Thrifty is like paying people to piss you off very badly.  Pay extra and go elsewhere.",0
3800,"This place is fantastic! Everyone that works there is friendly, and my puppy's tail wags like crazy the minute we walk in the door. I've used them for day camp, and also for overnight boarding, and couldn't be happier with the level of care she's received. They even sent me a coupon for a free day when she hadn't been there for awhile, just to keep them fresh in her memory! I always know that she plays hard when she's there, because she crashes when she gets home. It's nice to have a place that I can really trust to take care of my puppy as if she were one of their family.",1
3801,"The thing about the Cosmopolitan is that its so modern and hip and chic, its a little intimidating for those of us who only know about Kim Kardashian because ESPN tells us about the athlete she's banging and are not actively pursuing her kind of lifestyle.  However, I found it to be far more approachable than I expected it to be, especially during the day.\n\nThe people working there were very friendly, the restaurants are top notch, and the place is just flat out beautiful.  It doesn't hurt that the Cosmopolitan is a magnet for gorgeous women, the kind who think of Kim Kardashian as a role model, and hell I don't mind looking.",1
3802,"Awesome place. Cheap entertainment.\n\nNot sure why it took me so long to check this place out. I was only there for a few minutes, killing time before heading to the Thomas & Mack for the Rodeo. I put 50c into a Star Wars pinball machine and played the 3 balls. I then put $1 into a TMNT machine and got a lot more plays than I thought I was supposed to. It made me think, \""""Maybe I left some credit on the Star Wars machine.\"""" Sure enough, I went back to it and it had a few more credits left to use.\n\nThe point of that ramble is this: Your quarters go a long way here. I definitely have to come back. I didn't get to walk around the whole place and check out every row. As others have said, this place is truly a hidden gem.",1
3803,"I heard so much about this place I had to try it. I got three Tacos, very bland nothing special, a side of beans,lard free and the guacamole got the two starts. No service at all, or they must have been short of people. The server forgot the beans and finally my friend had to go to the counter and ask for it ( probably overlooked).  We were done with the tacos. \n\nThe tacos, reminded me of \""""where is the canasada?\"""" very little beef, the shredded lettuce didnt add anything and the salsa did not have any flavoring or punch. I love to support locally owned business, unfortunately we will not go back.",0
3804,"Went to Raising Canes today. First I have to say the place was clean and the staff was nice. I had  the Box which consisted of 4 chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw,toast and drink. The chicken was hot and not too greasy and seemed pretty fresh, but bland bland and more bland!! The sauce was okay but no real spice or flavor, need more choices in sauces, fries soggy not fresh, frozen and not cooked well, coleslaw out of a box not fresh. In my opinion it was very expensive for the quality of food. Won't be back.",0
3805,"Tried 4 different flatbreads, 3 sushi, lobster linguini, meat balls, 3 different beers, cocktails, and white wine, nothing is good.

And the prices are MUCH cheaper there than here. The sushi was not good and so plain. The one thing my boyfriend and I liked the most was the soup -- mine being the beef raddish soup and his the kimchi soup. The dessert section was small as well as their salad bar. \n\nFor the price per head it was, and even the kids being charged 13$ per child, I was highly disappointed...",0

The chef owner Matthew and his lovely wife Carla came out and talk to us for quite some time, and gave us wonderful tips on what to do for night life (George Street).

Thank you Matthew & Carla.",1

3809,"My family is from New York City and we were DYING for some rice. (We asians love our rice) We were driving around Chinatown and just over looking some of the menus and the Chinatown Plaza caught our eye, so we parked our car and checked out some of the restaurants. \nNothing on the ground floor interested us so we went up and saw Spicy City. It was pretty empty inside, only about 2 tables filled but the owner of the restaurant, a very friendly and jolly man, popped his head out and says \""""please! come try out the food! it's amazing, my wife cooks it!\"""" \n\nThis man did not lie. We had 4 dishes to share with a big pot of rice and soup. Everything was delicious, and this family owned business really hit the spot for my rice craving family. However, the food is very well seasoned with pepper so anyone who isn't very good at eating spicy foods, tell them to slow it down on the pepper cause this restaurants lives up to its name. \n\nI recommend asking the owner or his son for recommendations on the best foods for the night!",1

3814,"The other reviews cover auto part installation which may be their speciality.  But I used them to install an Interlock device through Instant Interlock.

3816,"Late at night and hungry, I discovered the Cambodian place down the street is a cash-only business. I chose this place because it was the only restaurant on the block with an open kitchen (many kitchens close at 10PM). Desperate times called for desperate measures, and I really should have taken the time to research a better restaurant.\n\nI ordered a seafood deluxe pasta dinner and chicken noodle soup. I was told it would take 10 minutes but it really took 30 minutes. I had planned on eating inside, but since it took so long, I asked for the meal to-go instead. By the time I got my food, I was pretty exasperated. The knot tying the bag was too tight, so I was unable to check the food; this meant I left without ensuring a fork was inside.\n\nThe food was very bad. I have no other way to put it. The pasta was completely tasteless. I know there was imitation crab in the pasta dish, but I can't decipher what else there was; I ate less than 10 bites. The soup was terrible, and I only had a few sips. The broth looked like Campbell's chicken noodle soup (except it looked like the same noodle as the pasta), but tasted saltier. The salad looked quite plain (seen better salads in an airport), but without a fork, I was unable to eat. The soup, salad, and pasta (with tip and tax) cost about $16, so I expect a decent meal at this price.\n\nI realize this is a pizza place and I should have ordered pizza, but I didn't want pizza. I also think if you're going to have a full menu, you should be able to properly present what's on the menu. I would've been better off ordering pasta from Pizza Hut. Attempting to eat pasta with a spoon didn't help either. Next time you're in the area, just skip this place.",0
3817,"Extremely disappointing and frustrating experience.  Highlights:\n\n- $10 unexpected parking fee \n\n- Before we entered we were told by staff that food or drinks were not allowed on the premises, \""""No exceptions.\"""" I learned that, actually, both were allowed, but only if you paid for them inside. When we did purchase food and drinks ($40 worth), we were never advised that we could not proceed into other domes with said food and drinks.\u00a0 At dome 3, the staff told us we had to throw away everything,\u00a0 which included the souvenir cups, before we could proceed (it's worth noting the concession stand is RIGHT NEXT TO dome 3). \n\n- The work I put in to pre register for the event (a laborious task due to a poor Web experience) was useless because the kiosks to activate/link profiles to your provided band didn't work. Also, I learned from a manager that the wristbands that were sent to AZ were not the ones they originally tested the experience with.  The wristbands did not work at all,\u00a0 and they we're eventually taken away from us by staff outside the level 3 dome because \""""they're vey defective,\"""" as one employee told me. \n\n- Staff activated each interactive game with random bands (I guess some actually worked?)...But this seemed to cause issues with the sensors that read body height; all but one of the games functioned poorly.\n\n- None of the 3D features worked,\u00a0 and we were told they would not work until Tuesday (3 days after our purchased event date). Very upsetting considering 3D features were advertised as part of the Marvel Experience. \n\n- Waiting times to enter domes were extreme (it took our group 40 minutes to enter the the Level 3 dome because the staff said they were fixing technical issues). Another 30 min for the 4D. Btw, why was it considered 4D if I'm watching a 1D movie on a big screen (no 3D glasses here), while sitting on a motion seat? \n\n- At the end of the event,\u00a0 I was asked by a staff member how was my experience.\u00a0 I gave my candid feedback and his reply literally was,\u00a0 \""""Well, at least you didn't pay $180 bucks per ticket like some other people.\"""" Because...that's supposed to make me feel better? \n\n- Sidebar: Is it just me or did I not see one piece of merchandise in the shop that featured a female character (even though they were featured in the videos throughout the experience). Male characters only for sale. That doesn't seem very balanced.\n\n- Further frustrated,  I asked who is on site to manage the whole experience.  I was told it depends... There's someone managing VIP, food, tickets,  and technology.  I asked for anyone who can make changes.  Strangely,  they send me to the ticketing manager.  When I provided my feedback I learned: no one really knows who or to what extent staff was trained (some staff admitted to me they hadn't been thru the experience), the wrong bands were sent to AZ, there isn't time for anything to fix things because \""""we go from 9 am to 11 pm everyday and there's no time to figure anything out,\"""" AZ was more of a \""""test ground,\"""" and the 3D won't be fixed until Tuesday,  after someone is flown in to fix it. \n\n- If you want a refund (I'm sure you will), I learned you have to request it through TicketMaster.\n\nBoo.",0

3821,"For someone who drinks as much coffee as I do in as many caf\u00e9s as possible, it's rare for a caf\u00e9 to truly surprise me. Pourquoi Pas did, and in a very good way.\n\nIt started with ordering a latte. I was met with a simple question: what kind of milk? The options that followed were not the \""""skim, 2%, whole\"""" that I'd expected, though, but rather, \""""house-made almond/coconut, soy, or cow's milk\"""". Hearing \""""lait de vache\"""" come across, with a slight prickliness to it, caught me off guard. (Of course I know milk comes from cows, but never when ordering a drink does that fact come to my attention.) I stumbled. I fumbled. \""""Regular, you know, um, milk.\"""" Herp de derp, smooth move, Katie. \n\nAfter tripping over my obviously non-vegan beverage order (callous carnivore as I am), I looked at the menu more closely and noticed that cow's milk carries an extra surcharge, and is indicated by a weepy broken heart on the chalkboard. I was tickled by their apparent display of ethics (and judgment?), and determined to try their lait maison the next time, so I could be a cool and compassionate coffee snob, too. I also noticed that their standard coffee was an Aeropress, which gets props from me (I love my home Aeropress), and also noticed the striking lack of other options on the menu. This is, uncontestedly, an espresso bar. A one-trick pony, perhaps, but that one trick is a showstopper.\n\nThe latte set before me -- made with creamy dairy goodness stolen from the mouths of bleating calves at their mothers' teats -- was phenomenal. Perfectly balanced, not bitter in the least, and made with a perfect microfoam swirled into lovely latte art. Mmmmm. \n\nThe next time at Pourquoi Pas, not even a week later, I tried their house almond and coconut milk, and was impressed. It made great foam, and had a rich but sweet nutty flavor. But, for all that, even with the added bonus of self-righteousness for not exploiting our bovine friends, I regretted not getting cowmilk. Sweet, delicious, calorific, uncompassionate cow's milk. I'll placate my conscious by imagining that the extra charge goes toward buying the most wonderful, single-origin, free-range, fair-trade, grass-fed, eco-conscious milk from the happiest cows in Quebec. Or one can hope.",1
3822,"Came here for the first time since they closed down the branch in LA and this is not a restaurant I'll miss.  We came for brunch and while they have a decent spread but this is just another upscale chain restaurant.  The service was hit or miss. It started off great but once we got our food we had to keep asking to get refills, to add another order and for the bill.  \n\nI think this would have been at least a 3-4 star restaurant if I ordered something else.  Both my friend and I got the corned beef hash which we did not like.  We both had the same complaint that the meat was dry so and with a bit of potatoes mixed in.  The dish was just so off balance with the lack of potatoes.  Both of our eggs were also overcooked.  The hash browns were decent.\n\nThe best part of my meal was the OJ which for the price they charge it better be good.",0
3823,"Yeah this place is horrible. I've been here for just under 2 years and I wish I was able to have moved out before I renewed my lease. The previous staff was alright. At least they were decent to talk to and understanding about day to day happenings. the new management team in the office now are cunts and have no sense of urgency or how to run a business. Because the rent payment process is for the most part automated, there is no need for them to be there other than to give tours and sign people up. With that being said, the model and the common area are FAR more upgraded and modern than the apartments them selves. The apts have 30+ year old appliances and we were told, well if they work then they are working by design and we can't replace them. But did I mention that they raised the rent after the 1st year? for what.. no property improvements have been made. The same low quality of people live in the place making what the previous person said to be entirely true. Waste and pet waste all over. Stupid parents let their small children play in the street so driving through the blind curves can almost be an accident waiting to happen. \n\nThe pool is never clean. the hot tub doesn't work. You can see the grossness in the water floating on top. There are constant issues with the apartment and complex as far as maintenance issues go. The resolutions are half assed and often repeated because a more solid solution is not sought out. The place is crawling with bugs, my payments to have that maintained is probably spent else where. The walls and ceilings are crap and look crap with the layers of paint over the problem areas. Band-aid approach to fixing things. Every month it is a new issue. They do not send out notices when complex wide issues/fixes will be happening. It really just is a crap place to live. Better options for 900+ a month and crappy service.",0
3824,"The food was good, but the service was substandard. We showed up before 8:30PM, and placed our order for dine-in. Then as we were sitting down the girl came out and told us that dine-in was not available, only carry-out. The sign on the door said they are open until 9PM.  I asked why dine-in wasn't available, and she just said that the owner wasn't there and that they don't allow dining in after 8:30P.  We decided to just get it to go, and not make waves.  I would hate to see what would have happened to my food If I argued about it.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our \""""carry-out\"""" meal, a customer came in, and while he was getting ready to order. The girl behind the cash register said, \""""We are only serving take-out right now, not dine-in.... and we are open for three more minutes.\"""" It was only 8:50PM. The customer just turned around and walked out. Obviously they were eager to go home on time and did not really care about their customers.",0
3825,"We have driven by this place numerous times, but were a bit confused (and turned off) by the diner motif.  Big mistake.  Took the plunge tonight and man, what a treat!  EXCELLENT sushi and gyoza.  Great selection here, from $6.00 sushi rolls to $100 sashimi plates, with everything in between.  Very friendly service, too.  We arrived a few minutes after 5:00 p.m. (when they open) and by 5:30 it was becoming quite crowded. Not only is the diner location quirky, the stereo tunes (Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin... were unexpected.  And enjoyed)  I have heard others talk about true, fresh, sushi and now that I've eaten here I'm not sure I've ever had true, fresh sushi.  Until now.  Highly recommended.",1
3826,"Way, way overpriced. Sure Vegas is expensive but this place goes beyond overpriced to obscenely overpriced and for just ok food. Not much in way of veggie options and if you ask, it's a flat no, you can't make any changes. \n\nTried to ask whether or not the vegetable roll had any meat or seafood in it. I was met with \""""vegetable roll\"""" and a weird totally fake smile. But does it have any meat in it? \""""vegetable roll\"""" only a little louder with the fake smile. There's no meat in it? \""""vegetable roll!\"""" Well, that was helpful. Never mind, I don't need to be eating fried food anyways. Food is also very salty, I was dying of thirst for the rest of the day.",0
3827,Was expecting a lot more for the price. Their focus is on seafood and I was expecting at least average is not better but it really missed the mark for me. Portions small and seafood not its freshest. Ambiance was nice but a little dated in the lighting and furniture.,0
3828,"Carne Asada torta = mmmmmmmm! So yummy! I saw someone's review that says the tortas come with Ruffles, yes, they do... And it totally makes the sandwich. I think the balance is awesome with crunchy, spicy, etc. \n\nMake sure you get everything on it, if you don't, don't bother going. Also, ask for jalepenos and spicy carrots. \n\nThe tacos are Mexico City style, small tortillas and carne asada, tripe, tongue, pastor, etc. So good. I went to Mexico City in May 2010 and this is as close to the real thing that I can find in Phoenix. \n\nI also love that the owners are sometimes the cooks!",1
3829,The staff is great! Met a few of them while working at a restaurant in Station Square and all of them were some of the nicest people I ever met. Years later I still go through them for concerts because they have the best customer service. Will support them just for that.,1
3830,"The cut of salmon is unacceptable.  It has a heavy, fishy taste that the $40 price does not warrant. I've had better, equally-fresh fillets at my local restaurants, and for much less. Question the quality or freshness of the fish and the management will stonewall you.",0
3831,"We stopped in here last night for dinner before First Friday. The place was pretty busy, and we were told we'd have a a 30 minute wait. However, it was closer to 45 minutes.\n\nThere's a big couch in the waiting area decorated with sombreros. The wall was covered with pictures of Frida Kahlo. I liked the look of the place and was looking forward to a good dinner.\n\nI ordered a chile relleno and tamal with pork in red sauce. My wife got a carne asada taco, chile relleno, and tamal with chicken in green sauce.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our food, we were given chips, salsa, and bean dip. The salsa wasn't very flavorful and the bean dip was lukewarm. \n\nIt took a very long time before we got our order. Once we got it, the food was lukewarm. The chile relleno was fine but nothing special. The tamales were okay, but again, nothing special.\n\nThe only thing I really liked was the carne asada taco. My wife got an order of flan. She's a flan snob and said it was one of the better flan she's had, second only to her favorite at Frank and Fina's Cocina.\n\nWhile we were waiting to be seated, I saw that there was Groupon available for Casa Don Juan. I bought it hoping it would be available to use by the time we were done eating. It wasn't, so I guess I'll be back. I'm hopeful that we'll have a better experience if we go when it's not so busy....I'll let you know!",0
3832,"\""""Sub-par\"""" would be generous.  We had Pani Poori, Mutter Paneer, and Chicken Tikka Masala. We've eaten a lot of Indian food and are big fans. All three of these dishes would be described as the worst version we've ever had.\n\nPani poori- the panis were stale and came with stew instead of the tasty veggies that dish is supposed to come with.  Chicken tikka masala- the chicken was mushy from having marinated in salt water for a long time, and it had huge raw onion slices on top.  The mutter Paneer was a special kind of terrible. It tasted like frozen peas saut\u00e9ed in expired skim milk, with some store-bought Paneer thrown in.\n\nService was gruff, including a manager (I guess manager- he was kind of doing expo) who accusingly asked \""""Are you done yet?\"""" as we sat there with only our water glasses... Waiting for for the check.\n\nI have no idea how this place has 3.5 stars. Reading the reviews, you'll notice that all of the terrible reviews are from people who know Indian food. All of the good reviews are from people who begin with things like \""""I've never had Indian food before, but...\""""\n\nI sincerely hope that those people get to try good Indian food- fresh ingredients, bold favors- some day, because Corriander --emphatically-- is not it.",0
3833,"Ok so I'll start by saying I used to work for JM at other locations (FL,NV). For the longest time I wouldn't go near another franchise (Subway, Quiznos, etc). Lately however, I find the prices at JM to be rediculous for some of their sandwiches. $10 for a giant?! Seriously? They used to be 8 bucks. For someone like me who gets their philly steak with just cheese and onions it makes for a pretty measly sandwich. We used to throw in a little extra meat if someone didn't want any other toppings otherwise the meat gets lost in the bread.\n\nThis location is by far the worst I have ever been to. The employees at McDonalds and Taco Bell have a higher IQ and a better attitude. Ordered a philly steak with just onions. How easy is that? Not easy enough I guess. Luckily I was watching and noticed her throw on peppers instead of onions. I would understand if it was a busy day and there was a line of people with lots of orders how it can get mixed up but the store was empty and I was the only person there. There were other employees hanging out on one side of the store talking loudly with either friends or co-workers cursing, making out, etc.\n\nOne of the girls even mentioned loudly how she had to go pick up her mom from prison bc she just got released. (lol)\n\nAnyway- the food is still good quality but make sure if you are going to go to any JM find a coupon first. Lots of BOGO coupons and stuff out there. Def worth it if you get a BOGO.",0
3834,"Good God, this was a great breakfast experience!  Biscuits & Gravy, potatoes, bacon.  I even got a hot chocolate to boot.  I thoroughly enjoyed my food.  The prices are real cheap and the portions are real big, not to mention awesome greasy spoon fare.  My dining companions raved about the steak special and they say the meat is good too.  Plus a brewery that has good beer too!  You would never know that so much good stuff is in this place.  It pays to get off the strip!\n\nWhy the 4 stars instead of the whole she-bang!?  One - I could not swap the ham for bacon on the Biscuits & Gravy special plate.  Okay, fine.  I ordered the items I really wanted separately and the price cost the same as the special.  But hey, I wanted the swap.  Two - our waitress was not very attentive.  It was a busy morning, so I will not go too hard on her, but getting a glass of water and getting plates cleared was just not happening that morning.  Oh well.\n\nI will be back, that is for damn sure.  Bring on the gravy!!!",1
3835,Horrible service.  I called for a cab and they informed me that someone would be here in 45-60 minutes and that the driver would call me when he arrived.  No one ever showed up.  I called back to talk to the company and was informed no one was in the area to take the call.  I asked why no one called me to inform me and she stated that I was supposed to call them back to check on the status.  No one ever told me I needed to call back to check the status.  I am a business owner and communication with your customers is key.  I will never recommend this cab company to anyone.  STAY AWAY FROM DESERT CAB,0
3836,"Very confused about this establishment! My husband and I thought we would try it out since we had never been there before. I walked in and asked a young lady at the hostess station for a menu to look over quickly. She replied that they didn't really have any menus that night. I gave her a puzzled look. She saw that I was walking with a walker and stated that \""""All of our TABLES are reserved for West Virginia fans. You can only get in if you are wearing WV gear.\""""  I bluntly asked \""""Are you telling me that I can't eat here?\"""". She said \""""Yes.\"""" I said \""""Nice.\""""  And hobbled away. Discriminate much?????  Unbelievable! I work across the street and you just lost a regular customer. Seriously, Management, you discriminate against disabled persons? You are idiots!!!!  BTW, I saw a a family on the patio and they were NOT wearing WV gear! So your host is a lying POC! Discrimination!!",0
3837,Scottsdale Skin needling is the only place in AZ which offers dry tattoo needling for scars. Linda's DC method was developed by her - so she definitely knows what would work on a patient and what wouldn't. I found her online while I was searching for an acne scar revision specialist. The best thing about her is that she prepares a treatment plan for you and orders products based on the conditions that she is treating you for. She is not a promoter of some big-fancy-branded products. I really like that about her. She just did my first skin needling last saturday and I'm really optimistic about the results that I will see in the coming months. I should say that she is an expert in her field!,1
3838,"I called \""""Anyime Garage Doors\"""" because there is a man in my gated community who works there and I always see his truck.  I'm real big on supporting local business's.  All I needed was to have them program a remote for me, I called and they told me 20 dollars.  The guy who came out tried to tell me that I needed over 300 dollars worth of repairs and parts to get my garage door working which confused me because it already worked.  I just needed a universal remote I had bought at Sears programmed.  I am a military spouse whose husband is gone often and have grown used to scams like this.  I told him no and to put it back the way it was and leave.  Only he didn't.  He put it back on and after he left I put my door down and the chain was so loose I was afraid it was going to break off.  I called the next morning to have them come back and fix what he had done and was unable to close the door.  That day a man stole my 1000 dollar Trek bicycle out of my garage.  My husband came back from his TDY trip and fixed what the man from Anyime Garage had done.  All I wanted was a remote programmed.  Instead I got a headache, and a irreplaceable bike that I had purchased in Italy stolen.  Do not trust this company.",0
3839,"I'm here with my husband at least once a week. The variety of frozen yogurt is fine, but it doesn't change often, but the toppings are out of control! I can't think of a single topping I'd like that they don't have. A wonderland of syrups and sprinkles and mashed up cookies and candies. So good! The interior is usually pretty clean and cute cartoons play from large screens inside. Also, if you check in on Yelp, you get a 25% discount. So cool!!!",1
3840,"I too thought that the ratings were a bit off...I mean really???,...all 5 Stars except some crazy person that gave it a 1 star.  I had my mind set that I was going to travel from Henderson to Mr. Brake on Jones / Desert Inn.  I had always gone there in the past and if I your on that side of town, stop in and give them a shot...Very Very good and reputable.  I thought I should check here first and was glad I did.  Jeff and Craig are every bit as professional and customer oriented as anyone seeking a non-sketchy business.  Every person that worked there said hello to me and anyone else that came in and did it with a smile on their face.  They looked happy to be there and happy to be taking care of you.  While waiting, a couple came in who had been sending the business post cards of their travels.  Jeff had even kept them and filed them away and not the circular file as one might expect.  Why would anyone send a business post cards of their travels unless that business made an impact on them? \n\nOK, lets get down to the bare facts.  They inspect your car and the problems you are having and then show you the results of their findings.  After that, they search out the best prices for you...they may not be as low as you want, but they do go the extra mile to get you to the best bottom line number.  They had quoted me 3 hrs and they nailed it...they let me know at 10:30 it would be 3 hrs and I walked out at 1:30.  They even offer to shuttle you where you want.  I chose to wait, so Jeff gave me the wi/fi code for my ipad and he also gave me the remote for the TV.  They take a crappy situation and try and make it as comfortable and less crappy for you.  Professionalism and Customer Service is what makes this business a standout in a sketchy industry.  Thanks guys for making my day a little easier and a lot safer!",1
3841,"My husband and I went here for our anniversary. I was expecting something great and fun and was disappointed. We had never been there before and according to the elevator we needed to go to the 3rd floor. after doing so, we had to walk through a small crowd of people that were at a bar right beside the theater. we get inside and were told that we have to go down stairs to get our tickets. The theater was not impressive at all. We did not order anything bis or special, just teas, chips and salsa, and 2 chicken tender meals and it took us approximately 30 minutes to get our drinks and chips and then about 3 minutes later out chicken tenders came out. No one came back to check on us the entire time. Even when the check was brought to us, the empty plates were not taken away until i asked someone walking by if they could take it. When we left, the crowd at the bar beside the theater was huge and we had to push our way through them. Needless to say, neither of us were impressed and I do not think that we will be returning!",0
3842,"We stopped in here after reading the yelp reviews, and it is a really good place. The restaurant is pretty small, but the food was good.  We ordered the beef wraps, beef curry, and a beef and noodle vegetable dish, along with a durian slushy and banana mango smoothie. We had stomachaches eating at wahoos before, and this place is so much better. The price was good too, and I felt full after eating here.",1
3843,"Beautiful breakfast this morning! Everything is so fresh and tempting. In the end, I went for the Bircher muesli and was not disappointed.

The sandwiches looked amazing!",1
3844,"Not really impressed with this place. We came here for a simple family night out stop.   We received a simple greeting upon walking in the door. Luckily, we've gone to froyo places before so we knew the drill, but I can't imagine how lost someone would be if it was their first visit. There were no sample cups in sight. The original tart flavor was out of commission, which unfortunately was what I wanted. So I had to concoct some weird mixture that just didn't do my flavor buds justice. My husband and son were pleased, hence the 2 stars. But the toppings were even lacking. The fruit looked subpar and demolished. The boba balls (is that what they're called?) were all popped and liquified. It took me a minute or two to finalize my cup and when I got to the counter I felt like I was getting devil eyes from the girl behind the counter, but that easily could have been me feeling bad for being so disappointed. I honestly won't be requesting to keep this stop in our weekly family outings.",0
3845,Went based on the great reviews and was a bit disappointed. The play area is small and dirty feeling. This maybe because most things are old including the benches for parent seating and the toys. The cashier was rude also. Was on the phone while taking payment. Won't go again.,0
3846,"Love this club on Sundays. Had a table and bottle service in the corner. Perfect location, right next to the outdoor area and right next to the dance floor. The music is great. Lot's of top 40, old school hip hop and r&b. It was a nice break from all the fist pumping music.",1

I really like mexican food and wanted to eat here, but it seemed like too much trouble to ask for a menu or even a recommendation on a dish.  I went about three different times throughout my stay in hopes of having a better experience, but no luck.  Even the atmosphere was annoying: waitresses that have a competition on who can dress the trashiest using red and black, cheesy saying hanging from the bar, etc.  The wheel thing is clever, but not clever enough to make this place worth going to.",0

3850,"BWW has lost it's appeal as they became more and more corporate and political based (or biased) and pricey.  BWW just blends in with the other national food chains now, and frankly aren't any better or worse, just kinda irrelevant and blah. They look, feel, smell and taste the same.  The customer service is scripted, and feels phony. Like the others. \n\nNothing stands out, unless you like a $20 plate of meh, so so wings and a $6 beer.  They nickel and dime you from there (charge for a little extra sauce, etc.  Not worth the money anymore.  \n\nSticking with local bars, and local or regional restaurants that didn't loose their focus while chasing the dollar.\n\nTo be fair, if someone in the group suggests we go to BWW,  I'll still go and have a good time, but I've had to modify my expectations to do so.  Knowing what the once were as small, strip mall restaurant with a handful of locations hurts my review after the became a standalone (hey look at us, we're just like Chilis, Friday's and Applebee's now). \n\nGood, okay but yet, meh...we can do better.

3854,"First off, I'm not one of those two star reviewers. You know the kind: \""""It cost so much!\"""" \""""I don't get the food, I like hamburgers.\"""" \""""This place is too fancy, so here's your one star.\"""" That's not me. I am a foodie. Check my other reviews for proof. So, given this disclaimer here's my two cents on L'Atlier...\n\nOne word: \nHalf-assed.\n\nPre-game:\nOur group of nine ate here this last weekend. I made reservations in advance. They required a $75 reservation fee (non-refundable and not applied to the meal). That's a first. And because we were a large group we were limited to tasting menus only. Fine. Ain't no thing - this place is #2 on Yelp. I'm excited! I love food!\n\nThe experience:\nWe were smashed into the wall. There was not enough room to get into our seats. Once the table was moved so all the ladies, in their lovely dresses, could shimmy in, they were trapped - the whole meal - full bladders and all. The service sucked. They already had their guaranteed 20% gratuity (because of our party size). So, we endured a meal full of empty glasses, missing silverware, and a wonky table.\n\nThe Food:\nAverage. We had two vegetarians with us (the restaurant knew about this ahead of time) and when the amuse arrived they were served foie gras mouse. You can't take the time to whip them up a gazpacho shooter? Two of the courses (in a row) had the same pesto sauce. Not a big deal, but the primary components were so bland all you could taste was pesto. \""""Sir, for your fist and second courses this evening you will be having pesto.\"""" Come-on! Most of the dishes were one note. In general the meal was uninspired. \n\nIn summary:\nWe left disappointed. Michelin should revoke their one star. I know it's harsh, but it's truth. Do you hear me, Bibendum?",0
3855,"Harvest is an excellent restaurant on the main square in downtown Madison. Their food incorporates local seasonal ingredients. I had a special salad of local heirloom tomatoes with a soft cheese (forgot the name), small leaves of basil and sea salt. Some of the best tomatoes I've had in years. I selected the home-made cavatelli pasta - made with pesto. sliced baby potatoes and green beans. Very good - and finished with a passion fruit sorbet. Highly recommended!",1

Guess this place doesn't do a lot of lunch business. \n\n2. I had the lamb kabobs which were dry and gamey like overcooked deer meat.  Meh.\n\n3. The decor leaves much to be desired, the food leaves much to be desired, and the service was slow and grumpy.  Did I wake them from their midafternoon siesta?  \n\n4. Even Olive Garden has more variety, more consistency, a more pleasant atmosphere and better value.  \n\nWith so many better options in Vegas, why would you come here?  Oh that's right.  No one does.",0
3857,"I received a ten dollar gift card to Best Buy recently (as much as I am thankful to receive a gift, $10 won't get you much at an electronics store!).  In any case, I figured I might be able to pick up at least one little item for that price.  \n\nWhen I arrived at the store today (12/12/12) around 1:00 PM, I looked around and found a female employee (whom I cannot describe other than she was wearing a tan cardigan on top of her store uniform).  When I explained the little predicament I was in (looking for ANYTHING under ten bucks that I might buy), she looked a bit annoyed, and suggested I buy candy (perhaps she thought I had been given a ten dollar Visa or American Express gift card and I should take the card elsewhere to buy said candy...but then, why would I be so foolish as to go to an electronics store with a $10 gift card that I could take anywhere? Or maybe Best  Buy actually does sell candy...I don't know). \n\n In any case, after I awkwardly laughed at her suggestion to buy candy, I reiterated my problem, and she walked me over to the DVD section, where there are at least a few cheap DVDs.  She indicated that some were $9.99.  I stated, \""""That's good, except with tax, it will be over ten dollars,\"""" to which she responded: \""""Well, yeah.\""""  Apart from the fact that I wasn't asking for something I could buy with the gift card PLUS additional money, her sarcasm was, yet again, off-putting.  She kept stating that most stuff in the store falls above the ten dollar threshold, and because of the \""""I'm so done with this customer, get me out of here!\"""" vibe that radiated from her being, I thanked her with a smile, and indicated I could take things from there.  \n\nI found an area for DVDs on clearance for a price of $3.99, that she did not even bother to bring me to for some reason, but frankly, I either had most of the movies, or they didn't appeal to me, so I didn't end up buying anything today.  But the employee at the door, a young man, said \""""Thanks for coming in today,\"""" to the elderly gentleman about fifteen feet ahead of me leaving the store.  When I got to the door, however, the aforementioned door attendant gave me a hollow, almost annoyed glance, and looked back into the store, not uttering one word of thanks to me.  Now, I don't normally care that much whether an employee says goodbye to me or not...but when I witness it occurring to another customer right ahead of me, of course I'm going to note the lack of politeness when no such kindness is extended to me....what am I, chopped liver?!?!   And the annoyed look was certainly unnecessary.  \n\nAs an investor, I have seen the financial trouble that Best Buy is having in a world where internet retailers such as Amazon are totally undercutting them.  It is for this reason that I have to wonder....where is the customer service?!   What makes a tangible, real-life store different than an online retailer?  Two things:  getting to test the equipment, and the PEOPLE!  The customer service, getting help, and answers to questions.  \n\nI have already written another less-than-complimentary review of different Best Buy location (I promise, I don't have any ill will for the company...I'd actually prefer them to garner my highest praise), and it all hinges around the same issue...customer service.  It  always seems to be that the store is either like a middle school dance, with the employees awkwardly huddled with their friends talking, looking out at the customers but too timid to ask them if they need anything....or it is like today where the employees just seem to act as if they have better things to do.  \n\nNOTE TO ALL BEST BUY STORES:  If you want to stand even the slimmest chance of surviving the fierce competition that online retailers are giving you, then fix your customer service.  I believe that there is a large group of people that still, and will continue to want a real-life shopping experience.  Give them a good experience, or I am almost sure that your company will go the way of Circuit City...out of business.",0

3860,"I decided to dine at Good Food on Montford for my birthday.  2 reasons: it's highly recommended (look at all these 5 stars!) and it's on Montford, which makes post-dinner drinking easier since we could just walk up & down the street.  NOTE: parking is limited.  You may as well just look for a spot on the street.  DO NOT park in another lot or you risk being towed.\n\nConsidering that I have been disappointed by so many highly recommended places, I was trying to keep my expectation low all day.  We called at 5:30 (they open for dinner only) to make RSVP for 7 people.  My bf & I arrived earlier than expected and they already had our table ready.  The place is tiny but it feels warm and intimate.  Overall I like the decor & atmosphere.\n\nBecause I was there with my closest friends, I didn't pay much attention to service since we were occupied with conversations.  It was a little slow at times, took a while to be able to order our wine after we asked for a minute to look at the options.  They could have brought the bread out earlier since we didn't get to order food right away.  But overall it was fine.  We were having too much fun to mind the wait.\n\nNow the food... I am glad to announce there was no disappointment!  With a table full of foodies, we just forked each other plates.  Food are served tapas style, with the exception of the few larger plate items.  Here are my thoughts on some of the items:\n\nSteam bun: Reminds me of chinese sweet pork steam bun at dim sum places.  It was very delicious.  Well executed item but it's a little pricey.  The surprise hit item of the night.\n\nBeef carpaccio: It was fresh and served with a small side of arugula & shaved parm.  Not the most flavorful item.\n\nFalafel: The only item I say you shall skip.  It's not crispy and fluffy like it should be.  The consistency resembled play-doh... not exactly appealing as a food item.\n\nBroccoli soup: Very delicious and sizable.  I'm a soup freak and I loved it.\n\nPEI mussels: Everyone swore by this item and we love seafood.  The sauce was indeed fabulous.  It's a nice change from the typical white wine or tomato sauce.  The coconut and curry and cilantro were perfect together.  It's of good portion as well.  \n\nDuck fettuccine: Not at all what I thought it would be.  The sauce threw me off a little, it's more tomato than creme.  The duck was a little tough.  It was good, but not as great as I hope.\n\nCrispy quail lettuce wrap: More like quail served on a bed of lettuce.  Don't get me wrong, the little birdie tasted fabulous, but it's not as elaborate as it sounds.\n\nChilled noodles: light and tasty.  One of the more filling dishes.\n\nSeared scallops: Good, solid dish.  Not sure what it was served on, I thought it was risotto.  I had a little bite so I couldn't tell for sure.\n\nPomme frites: I'm not a big fan of fancy french fries.  It tasted good, but not sure if it's $6 good.  My friends said the truffle oil was a bit strong on the top. \n\nPork Tenderloin: It tasted good... but I felt like something was missing... not sure what.  The pork was tasty and moist.  The polenta was good.  \n\nPot de Creme: For someone who doesn't really eat much chocolate or sweet, this is a good dessert to have.  Not too heavy, enough chocolate taste but also a good hint of expresso.  \n\nWarm cobbler with vanilla ice cream:  Very cute presentation, since it's in an individual baking dish. \n\nWHEW!!!  I felt that I need to review all these items.  The food overall was excellent.  I see why everyone raved about this place.  Now I'm freaking hungry!",1
3861,"This was a real disappointment.  While it is in a great location - right downtown Charlotte, the food was pretty mediocre. I ordered the grilled Ceaser salad with pulled pork. There was a good amount of meat, but it was dry and pretty bland. The salad was watery and I saw no evidence of the \""""slightly charred\"""" lettuce leafs. I tasted my friend's brisket, and it was even drier than my pulled pork. \n\nThe service was ok, but if you want some good BBQ, I'd steer clear of this restaurant.",0
3862,"We dined in for lunch one day, the floor had been mopped with a dirty/sour mophead, you can smell the funky odor on the floor. Teri beef is fatty/greasy and tough. Mahi Mahi is just chunks of cooked fish. Huge slathering of stucky white rice and overly mayoed mac salad with no flavor. My chicken katsu came with what I still think is ketchup and no katsu sauce. I asked for katsu sauce and the boss lady says that is katsu. No it's Ketchup, not tonkatsu sauce like everyone knows. So I asked for a side of teri sauce instead. My chicken katsu is Deeeep fried extra hard and the chicken had tough skin underneath. Too crunchy and taste like low grade chicken, greasy. Overly mayoed mac salad and a huge wave of white rice that wasn't all that fresh. Is this good food? I guess some think so and they are welcome to it. I like a certain place on 215 and Green Valley or 215 and Eastern much better.",0
3863,"this review is from a past dining in February 2014, better late then never...\n\nfirst and foremost! great decor, location and atmosphere, It being a Thomas Keller signature restaurant at The Venetian Hotel and Casino i had full expectations, however its not what i got! and for those reasons i can rate this only 2 star based on my personal experience.   The night my Sister and I had decided to have dinner at this location, we got seated right away near the Seafood bar, 5 minutes later a couple was seated next to us. at this point we still had not received any complimentary bread & butter like most restaurants would do at the time your seated. \n\nour neighbors had received their's first in addition they were already ordering their appetizers, by this time we were barely getting our bread and drinks were being ordered. easy to notice that our service was becoming very slow and delayed on our table.  \""""ill remind you we were seated first, and this couple was seated 5 minutes later, after our arrival\""""  at this stage they are having their drinks and first order of appetizers were being served to our neighbors, Yet we were still waiting on our appetizers. \n\nminutes after our neighbors are having their entree's where we are still working on our first course. 15 minutes had past our neighbors are getting ready to pay their bill and go on with their night. YET, we still have not received our entree's waiter did come out and say what was happenings, 20 minutes later, i decided to call the manager on duty and explain what was going on, that our service from the time of arrival had not being going well, our neighbors who were seat next to us arrived 5 minutes later, and had already left..  at this stage i was very upset and very unhappy, that a 2 course dinner took nearly 2 hours! WTF\n\nthe food was good, but nothing extraordinary or worth the wait, meh, at this stage the manager decided to go and speak with the back of the house and all sudden 2 minutes later our waiter comes out being very applogetic about the service, and offered us complimentary desserts on the house. which my sister and I opted out! which just wanted to leave!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe overall experience at Bouchon was horrible service far the worst that i have received at any fine dining restaurant! there was no compassion on the staff of the serviced received, therefore for those reasons i would never come here again or recommend this to anyone. the food was not the greatest to my taste!",0
3864,This traditionally is my last stop in Vegas.  I was so FULL from eating eating eating the entire week... but the Gelato was so refreshingly delicious!  I have never had it before because I have always had a hard time choosing that over the delicious looking pastries.  Best Part.. Jean Phillipe Maury was standing in the hall across from the Chocolate Fountain talking with another chef... no one knew it was him:),1
3865,"I tried this restaurant due to it's proximity to hiking in the Superstitions.  We stopped by after a hike.  The only positive that I have is that the place looks nice and has a nice patio with a waterfall.  I ordered a green chili burro and my wife ordered beef tamales.  Several minutes after I placed my order the waiter came back to tell me they were out of green chili.  No biggie here but at a good restaurant I would expect the waiters to know if they were out of something this basic before the order went in.  \n\nI changed my order to green corn tamales.  When the waiter brought the order out he could not tell which plate had the beef tamales and which were green corn.  He takes the plates away for about 5 minutes to figure it out.  So we were teased with a preview of our meal only to be left hungry for 5 more minutes.  \n\nWhen he brought the plates back we discovered that they were both beef tamales.  I tasted one and it was hard, salty and not at all like any tamale I had ever had.  He took my plate and re-order my tamales.  It took too long for the re-order to come out.  My wife was pretty much finished by the time I got my plate.  She was disappointed in her meal but to starved to hold back from eating it.\n\nMy green corn tamales were better than the beef tamales but not good.  They smothered them with cheese and drenched the plate in a runny sauce.  The rice tasted like rice and tomato sauce and the beans were just straight up nasty.  I could not eat more than one bite.\n\nAs starving as I was from the hike I could not come close to finishing the plate.  I left still hungry.\n\nThe waiter, although friendly, did not offer any amends to the lack of green chili or the tamale mix-up.  \n\nI'll never go back to this place.  Overall this was the worst restaurant experience I have had in a long time.",0
3866,"My kids love coming here for storytime.  They sing songs, read a book and usually do some kind of craft at the end.  It can get a little crazy sometimes, people letting their kids run wild while the story is trying to be read, etc.  I recently rediscovered the library by coming here for storytime.  I didn't realize they had such a great selection and that you could get new releases at the library.  I am a pretty fast reader and hate paying for a book I read in a day.  It is super easy to request books online.  I usually just run in to grab something I have requested off the hold shelf.  They have computers you can reserve and like most libraries they have free wi-fi.  I have tried to use their wi-fi printing but it seems like they are always having issues with it.   They have a security guard that seems to keep everyone in line.  I've never seen any problems here.",1
3867,"I personally love this bakery but it is too far away!!  From bakery to bakery you will find that the sugar content changes even when comparing what you think are \""""like\"""" products. For instance, a cream puff, if you are at a french bakery the cream puff may look the same but they generally go lighter on the sugar ingredient so you may even be able to detect a slight egg taste in the pastry, Jewish bakeries and Mexican bakeries also tend to go lighter on the sugar so although it is a tasy treat I often walk away thinking it was good but I have had better. Great Buns bakes the way I like it. The Cream Puffs a light and fluffy and sweet like I believe a dessert should be. Not sugary, mind you, just sweet and delicious. Obviously there are bakeries that have slightly changed their recipes to meet the American sweet tooth market and this is one of those bakeries.\n\nAs an extra bonus, if you call them and tell them you are looking for a certain treat such as a Napolean, if they don't have them available that day they will try to accomodate your request by making them the following day or day after.  They have always been wonderful about trying to fill your sweet tooth cravings for you.  BTW Napoleans are very hard to find around town and theirs are to die for!!  Call ahead and make sure you arrive on a day they have Napoleans available. You will not be disappointed...:)",1
3868,"Everyone knows that when you go to a comedy club that you don't want to sit in the front row because you are going to get ripped into. Well, at Vinnie's show it doesn't matter where you sit because he will find you.  \n\nWe went to his show in February of 2009 and I have to tell you that we are still talking about it. He is hilarious. He says things that make you so very uncomfortable. I was torn between dreading the moment he saw me and having the anticipation kill me.  \n\nHis show is very definitely worth whatever the charge is. His show alone will make your Vegas vacation special and something you will talk about for years. \n\nTed's review says it all. The CD's you can purchase after the show are great. Now everyone back home can hear all that went on.  \n\nBest show in Vegas by far.",1
3869,Unbelievable experience!  Just moved here from Chicago and my mom is a hair stylist.  I've always been very wary of getting my hair cut as I never had to pay for it.  I was done up by Radi and he was absolutely amazing!  Attention to detail and precision were second to none.  Best haircut in my life!,1
3870,"Subways is Subways, and they generally all taste the same consistently and have pretty decent quality ingredients. The reason for the low rating at this particular location is because of our server. He was very rushed, brusque, and stingy when it came to any of the add-ons. \n\nNot sure if it was this location that was stingy or if it was just the server. I had to ask three times for more bell peppers because he barely put any on each time, and just didn't bother with the rest of the ingredients or we'd be there for a while. \n\nHe also dropped something behind the counter at one point and picked it up to throw away without changing his gloves as he went back to prepare food. Since I didn't see what it was or where/how he picked it up I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt.",0
3871,This place is amazing. What friendly service too! I ordered the steak w poached eggs on chilequiles. Everything was SO fresh and delicious tasting!!!!!!! My steak (ordered med rare) was cooked perfectly and tender! And the waitress was so nice & attentive. Loooooooove this place!,1
3872,"Well, based on the reviews, I would have to say that the sushi was disappointing. The flavor and quality of the sushi was decent, but the portions of the fish on the rolls was very skimpy. I have eaten a lot of sushi in my life and this was by far the smallest servings of fish that I have ever seen. Even my out of town guests commented.\n\nThe customer service was pretty good, that's about the best I can say, unfortunately.",0
3873,"I'm going to do a 2 for 1 review. I went here last Friday for lunch and had the steak sandwich special and it was really good. So I thought why not go back today for lunch. I ordered the guacamole burger and my lunch date ordered the beef stew. First they served me a moldy piece of lettuce on the burger and the burger tasted like shit. Second the beef stew looked and was actually worse than dog food. The meat was so tough that when I tried it it took me at least a minute to swallow one piece. So I guess this place is gonna be one of those hit or miss type restaurants. If the food was more consistent I would probably eat here at least once a week, now I'll probably avoid Sierra Bonita like the plague. $40 for lunch and crap food is unacceptable!!!",0
3874,"My daughter's cheer team stayed here for one night because that was about all we could take. Our girls are 6, 7 and 8 years old. There were all kinds of creepy people hanging out around the hotel along with a package of sex toys that one of our coaches happen to get a photo of.  One of our dad's was approached by one of the bartenders letting him know if he needed sexual services that he would be sure to get it there at Rumor. My cheer team was promised we could practice in the courtyard, but there was dog poop all over the place so that wasn't possible. Our cheer practice ended up being moved to an inside room, but the ceilings were short so we were unable to do our stunts. One of our moms had absolutely no hot water in her room to take a shower. the room I had was very dusty, missing a living room lamp, the sofa had black stains on it and had no throw pillows on the beds. The room literally had to be cleaned while we were in it. \n\nOverall it was HOTEL HELL. Nice try, but I can never do it again.",0
3875,"Normally have a great experience. Last time I came in, my entire experience only lasted 25 minutes!!!!

After dropping $60 and walking out with an uneven cut, I dont think I will be returning back here again. I think the Haircut portion of my appointment only 10 minutes! How can anyone expect to get a decent haircut in 10 minutes. they spent more time doing the foo foo pampering stuff",0
3876,"This dealership misrepresents and does not stand behind their repairs.  Our Acura broke down while we were on vacation.  We had to have a whole new engine installed.  Findlay Acura did the work and said we had a 12 month warranty on it.  6 months later, we had to take our car in.  This time it was the transmission.  The dealership said the part that was leaking was a non-authorized Acura part that Findlay installed.  Acura client relations confirmed this fact, yet Findley will not reimburse us for the damage this leak caused to the transmission or, at the very least, reimburse us for the cost of replacing this part.  A person pays more at a dealership expecting to get proper parts and service.  This is NOT the case!  If you see Findlay, run - for that matter, if you see Acura, run!  We have spend over $11k in repairs in one year.  Since we still owed on the car, we had no choice.",0
3877,"I wasn't sure to expect as this is my very first Kimpton experience ever. I've always heard good things, but I'm a bit of a snob and let's face it, I don't like being out in the middle of the desert. I mean, what is out here other than cacti and tacky Southwestern decor?\n\nWell, let me tell you I was all wrong. \n\nTaggia is great Italian out in the desert. We ate poolside for lunch today and it's been a while since I've felt so glamorous. \n\nThe bread is crusty and delicious. Everything that rustic Italian should be. I drenched the green olive bread in olive oil with a little salt and pepper. OoooooOOOhh. I think that was, uh, 6 slices that I downed.\n\nThe prosciutto crudo was ordered with a side salad instead of fries. It came out and I got looks of envy from my workmates who ordered the pizza or salad or turkey sandwich. *snore*\n\nI haven't seen this much prosciutto on a sandwich outside of my home in a long while and the mozzarella was plentiful and fresh with just a drizzle of olive oil. MMMMmmhhmmm.\n\nI don't think that people normally yelp side salads because really it's just a side. But there was an artful simplicity to this side of greens lightly tossed in a vinaigrette with julienned red onions on top. So pretty and so perfect with the sandwich. \n\nI couldn't have done it better myself.\n................................................................................................................\n2 October 2007\n\nWe had a \""""working lunch\"""" at Taggia. My branch chief and director both ordered my prosciutto crudo. I felt like the most popular intern there.\n\nI wanted another side salad so I went for the tuna sandwich which is tons more elegant than the average school yard version.\n\nWhole chunks of moist tuna with olive oil and sea salt with halved cherry tomatoes that were white, yellow, and orange. How chic!\n\nIt turns out that the chef at Taggia abhors cream and mayo (holla!) and refuses to mayo up sandwiches and drown pasta in cream sauce.",1
3878,"Highly recommend this place. I have told many of my co-workers about this place because it's so good. The Mexican food is great with amazing ambiance and a gorgeous building. The service was a bit slow and inattentive but we went fairly late so there is that. \n\nIf you go, you must try the Sopapillas! They are to die for! Great for a date night place too!",1
3879,"If you do want to come here, then ideally you want to come for a rugby game, simply because that is the sport this stadium was built to show and when you do decide to come you'll find it won't cost you much to do so even during the Six Nations.  You do get football games here, most notably for any European cup runs the Edinburgh teams might be having, but really this place deserves to be given the chance to show you a decent rugby clash.\n\nEven if you are not a great sports fan, watching a game at a stadium like this is not the same as watching it on the telly - it really is a completely different prospect.  Instead of being solely about watching the game it's all about the atmosphere and during Six Nation clashes the atmosphere really is electric.  On these days the stadium does deliver all it promises and if you get the chance to see a Scottish game here, do take the chance.",1
3880,"Very Good, But Not Memorable\n\nI went here with two friends, and we ordered the menu that allowed us to select two appetizers, two entrees, and one desert.  In doing so, we were able to try a lot of the dishes.  The food was delicious, sometimes borderline amazing, but all in all, a bit underwhelming.  The service was okay, but nothing that rises to the level of a Michelin star.  After finishing the meal, the only thing I was thinking was that Guy Savoy is better.  If you are fortunate to be able to afford a meal like this, choose Guy Savoy.  The service, food, and d\u00e9cor are a level above Joel Robuchon.  (I also found that L'Aterlier was also underwhelming.  Maybe the quality in Vegas just slipped.  Either way, at this price point, underwhelming is unacceptable.)",0
3881,"I'm normally a fan of PF Changs but this experience was not good at all!  I wanted to take my mother since she had never been.  I always bring home food for her to try.  This was not what I hoped her first PF Changs experience would be! \n\nThe beef with broccoli was over cooked, and when we asked about it we were told that's how it's ALWAYS made.  The Mongolian Beef was overlooked as well.  I had a cup of wonton soup...lets face it you can't really mess that up!\n\nOverall the service was less than stellar,the waitress was a bit rude. When the manager came over to speak with us we were asked had we ever been to PF Changs? I asked why he wanted to know he said because we were asking about the food and explained to me how PF Changs is not a \""""typical\"""" Chinese restaurant.  I explained to him I was a regular at my local location and have NEVER had beef cooked to the point it was basically beef jersey, nor had I ever been treated like that in a restaurant.  \n\nI will continue to frequent the PF Changs in the PH hotel/casino, but will NOT go back to this location!",0
3882,"Last time we went to this KFC they forgot the sides.  They did it to us again on Sep 3rd. No fries, and no biscuits.  We have had issues with this particular KFC location before so from now on I think we will stick to El Pollo Loco if we want chicken.  EPL tends to get the order correct.\n\nOne other thing: the chicken is extremely salty, like dead sea salty.  Is that a KFC trend or just this location?  I am guessing KFC in general.",0
3883,"The staff is amazing. The facility is clean and calm. This is our first visit and we will definitely return as regular patients. They handled our cat Howie with love and affection. \n\nWe came for a first time check up because Howie is a new addition to the family and came to us with matted fur: we want to have him groomed. I originally thought that he would need a complete shave, which would require anesthesia, and lots of money. Since the cat belongs to my teen, she is responsible for the cost. When the technician suggested that we could just have his matted areas shaved, we were very pleased. \n\nThe entire visit, checkup, nails clipped, shots and shaving, took less than 30 minutes. And Howie loved the attention and we could tell he wasn't traumatized by the visit. \n\nWe definitely recommend All About Cats!",1

I'm unsure why this was relevant, it only made me feel like an inconvenience and that she was doing us a favor. My son got the shrimp those were good. These rest of our meals were awful. I got the roast beef sandwich and it was so greasy I couldn't pick it up, the bun fell apart on the bottom. The Mac and cheese was not much above kraft. The pasta was way over cooked. I was going to give 2 stars until we sat and waited 20 minutes after we were done eating for someone to address we needed the check. After we received our food we did not see anyone until that point, once the 3 of us had to stare down the staff to get attention.",0
3888,"I saw Mystere summer of 2005, so I apologize for my review being so late, but I doubt the show has changed much since then.  Regardless if you pay $80-200 a ticket. Mystere is definitely a show worth every single penny. \n   Mystere's stage/theater is not as amazing as O, and the story for Mystere is definitely not up there with Ka.  However, what Mystere lacks in those areas it makes up with amazing acrobatics and gymnastics that Ka and O can't compete with.  Mystere's story (if there is one) is definitely more on the fun, circus-like kooky side of things.

I highly recommend Mystere for anyone regardless if you've seen another Cirque show or not.\n~G",1
3889,"Oh, how I wanted to love this place. We always want to support the businesses in Slope. \n\nOn a positive note, the horchata was excellent - not too sweet. The also have a great looking menu with tortas, tacos and cool apps. \n\nUnfortunately, the execution was horrible. We had to throw away both orders of elote (one of our favorite dishes). The corn was rubbery and SLATHERED in mayo. Also, no lime included. No lime with the elote? This was the very first time in my entire life I have had elote I didn't like. They need to send their cooks to Gallo Blanco to check out good elote. \n\nAfter seeing their PapaNachos dish on Facebook, we also ordered that. The picture showed cheesy waffle fries with jalape\u00f1os. Yes please! Like the elote, they were extremely disappointing. No jalape\u00f1os - just cheez wiz on waffle fries. Boring, soggy and gross. \n\nWe didn't finish any of the 4 items we ordered and left extremely disappointed. I'm being nice giving it 2 stars. With so many good options around (Reyes, Gallo, etc), they are going to need to improve quickly to stick around.\n\nMaybe their cooks need more training - not sure. I would skip this place for a bit until they get this figured out.",0
3890,"We came to Bratalian for Restaurant Week 2014 and were very excited, given the excellent reviews. Although some aspects of our experience were good, overall it was weak enough that I don't think we'll be back. \n\nService: We called at about 5:15 to make a reservation, but the line did that fax machine screechy sound. Okay, then! We'll take our chances! On the ride there (it's about 25 minutes away from us), we worried that the place would be packed because of Restaurant Week so we called. The hostess was very accommodating and cordial, promising us a table. When we arrived, however, our luck with service changed. We didn't have a single server. Our order was briskly taken by one waiter, the food was dropped by another, and our dessert order was taken and delivered by the manager. The place was pretty busy, but other tables seemed to have good service. We felt overlooked and kind of like nuisances! The biggest issue is that they added an 18% gratuity and then taxed it. This is not typical procedure for Restaurant Week and I resented not necessarily having the gratuity added (I guess), but being taxed on it - I think - is in bad form. \n\nFood: From the Restaurant Week menu, we had the meatballs and fried calimari and zuchinni to start. Then, for our entrees, we had the linguine clams and the salmon with a lemon-butter sauce. For dessert, we had the profiteroles and the ricotta cheesecake. I thought the food was fine. The fried calamari didn't have much seasoning and was overly greasy; the dipping sauce on the side was a simple, plain marinara. If the calimari is going to be so plain, at least offer something a bit zestier for dipping. The meatballs were below average. They are VERY large, but, again, there wasn't much flavor. They were also a bit dense and dry; we were hoping for plump, juicy meatballs. The entrees were much better. The clams in the linguine were big and so flavorful. My salmon was probably the best part. The skin was crispy, the fish was cooked perfectly, the lemon-butter was succulent, and the sauteed spinach was a lovely compliment. If I come back, I would get the same entree. I was really looking forward to dessert because of other reviews, but I gotta say, the ricotta cheesecake didn't live up to the hype. I thought it was too dense and bread-y. The flavor was fine, but I didn't finish it because of the density. It was like a having a mouthful of wet sand! The profiteroles that my boyfriend ordered were good. The pastry was flaky and what can go wrong with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce?We had a half carafe of red wine along with our food, which gave us about 3 glasses total. \n\nAtmosphere: It's a small restaurant, but it's very cute. It's decorated perfectly and arranged so that it's size is not a problem. It's lively - lots of groups. There were a few slip-ups that night: a tray of dishes crashed, the smoke alarm went off in the kitchen. No major issues, really. Just added to the fun. The biggest \""""atmosphere\"""" problem for me is the broken lock on the women's room door. I struggled to get out of that bathroom for like five minutes, which doesn't seem like a long time until that's the amount of minutes you spend involuntarily in a bathroom. I had almost resigned myself to my new life as a bathroom-dweller, about to start fashioning a bed out of toilet paper, when I finally escaped. Bratalian, you've got to fix the door. \n\nOverall, it was just okay. The service was unexceptional and simply got the job done. The food was fine. Unfortunately, that's not really enough to have me come back.",0

The waiting room, though small, was very nice and relaxing. The woman behind the counter was decently friendly but she looked busy. The woman that escorted me into the room was very nice as was the dentist Alex Song. The dentist's voice was so calming that he almost put me to sleep... normally that would be a bad thing for me but considering his profession, it's probably one of the best qualities he can have. Oh, and a nice flat screen playing Iron Man while I was in the hot seat didn't hurt either! Nice place, great aesthetics, and a nice staff. It's only not getting the full 5 stars because it's not the cheapest place I've found but they did give me a good discount because of some promotion they were running.",1
3896,"Decided to wait out rush hour here tonight. Nice staff. My BF and I shared the Primavera Con Carne and the Pizza Del Re.  Both were good Neapolitan style pizzas.  I am not very partial to white button mushrooms, so I had to ask the server about the mushrooms on the Del Re.  They were white button, but the pizza was still awesome.  The truffle spread was RICH!  I personally don't recommend eating the Del Re by yourself.  Don't get me wrong, I'd order it again in a heartbeat..... but it would just be too much by itself.  Doing a salad and half this pizza for two people would be the right amount.  Or like I did, mixing in the Primavera Con Carne which had the acidity from the tomato sauce and the marinated artichokes to cut the heaviness of the Del Re.  We finished with a sweet and creamy, yet tart acidity Key Lime Pie gelato, which was heavenly.  The girl behind the counter said that she was happy that I did a taste test of the key lime and liked it.  She said it was her favorite, but 90% of the time she recommends it, no one gets it.  So she just stopped recommending it.  Sometimes the best things are left undiscovered.  Leaves more for me:)   I will be coming back for your Key Lime Gelato.  It was a perfect ending to a rich and filling dinner.",1
3897,"This place was not great.  They weren't busy so I got in right away, but that's about it.  The towels used were dingy and had holes in them.  The place looked and felt dirty. When the guy was cleaning my toes, he would wipe his tools on my feet instead of the towel. I wasn't impressed and will continue looking for a good spot near my house (have a great one near my office).",0
3898,The doctors and techs at this hospital bar none have been the most caring and compassionate vet I have ever experienced. My dog swallowed the end of a rawhide bone yesterday and I rushed her there hysterical of course. They gave her immediate attention and saved her life. That let me sit with her as she woke up from sedation and also stayed with us as she came to. Dr.Isom was right by our side and couldn't have been more comforting through my hysterical crying. After all was said and done I returned home so grateful with my girl Jazzy. Thank you Indian Bend,1
3899,"I enjoy Encore. It's almost prettier than the Wynn. It's got lots of red and butterflies. I feel rich just walking through it. And there are some great restaurants. It's never as crowded as the Wynn and other uppity properties. The cocktails at the various bars are wonderful. The pool is awesome. Parking is a breeze. But alas, it is still too rich for my wallet. Gaming here is not exactly an option unless you can drop like $100 a hand. But nonetheless, very pretty to walk through.",1
3900,"Excellent meat.  Excellent cheese.  Friendly and knowledgeable staff to guide you through it all.  This is a place with a clear focus on what it wants to be, and it succeeds!  I highly recommend asking for help and advice as the folks here really know their stuff.  My personal favorite was the goat sausage, but the extra thick bacon sliced to order was a close second.",1
3901,"Well, one reviewer said that if I'm used to dining on NY or SF, this place won't blow my mind.  Maybe they didn't eat what we did.\n\nGranted, two of the four things we ordered were specials: a lovely capon rillette appetizer, and a top sirloin (slow cooked in a sealed bag with herbs for four hours, and it shows!) entree.  That appetizer was incredible, the top sirloin was delectable and from Australia, just like my date, and the salmon I ordered absolutely melted in my mouth, just like my d... err... anyway!  My warm goat cheese salad was amazing with plenty, if not too much cracked pepper on top.  I asked our waiter to bring lots of pepper, and being a total character from Chicago, he more than obliged.  I think he went a little overboard, yet otherwise, he was a really fantastic waiter, and I did find it hilarious, if not just a touch too spicy.  Delicious though!  He also chose us a very lovely wine to go with our meal, was a great conversationalist, and brought us tiny cookies from their pastry chef, who is diabetic, just like my date!  No kidding.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the menu comes wrapped around your napkin, and they will fold your napkin for you if they come by when you've momentarily left the table?  They are SO attentive: truly excellent service.\n\nOverall, a lovely dining experience, and I look forward to checking out the others here in CA once I finally drag my classy butt up to the wine country.",1
3902,"Rice Paper, a sister location, has it down. We are aware that both venues are owned by the same owner but this one need a little discipline. The spring rolls we loosely wrapped, filled with to much lettuce and the sause was good but runny. We will be back cause we live close but for now we will go back to 7th street for our fix.\nGave them another chance last night. Much better! So I added a star.",0
3903,Roberto's has the best carne asada burritos and the fixin's at the salsa bar are tasty. Red and green sauce and spicy carrots and lime wedges. Also enjoy the 3 rolled tacos with guc.I do agree with some of the reviews about the place being a mess. But that is some of the appeal to most taco shops. I mean risking your life for good tacos and burritos is exciting and I also agree this place is perfect after a late night of drinking.,1
3904,"I'm 100% Italian-American. I grew up on Italian, home-cooked food, I've spent a month in Italy and literally ate my way through the country, and have an eleven-letter Italian last name that people constantly butcher when they try to pronounce it.  It is that experience that prompted me to sign up for Yelp and give Battista's its deserved one star. It was dismal. \n\nThe main reason I am writing this is to dispel myths circling around (from LOCALS no less) that this place is fun and has good Italian food. Neither is true. Though our wait staff was attentive and prompt, the good service we got just didn't outweigh the bad food. \n\nThe decor is kitschy - crap all over the place. The food pricing is way too expensive for iceberg salad, adequate garlic bread and mediocre wine. I ordered a chicken dish and had minestrone. They were both way too salty (a trick used by restaurants to hide poor quality or good-tasting food). And yes, the accordion player was awkward to say the least. \n\nOver-priced, overrated and a tourist trap with a miraculously good reputation. My advice? Go to Maggiano's for GREAT Italian food. Or Olive Garden. Or Buca di Beppo's even.  Just please, don't go here. Don't perpetuate the Battista's myth.",0
3905,"We tried the cheese curds because we told they were among the best in town.  The might be, if you like lots of breading with bits of cheese. \n\nThe portobello sandwich had to be marinated in salt.  The mozzarella on it was dry and lacked any flavor. With all the salt you wouldn't be able to taste it anyway.\n\nThe chicken salad sandwich....the filling was minimal, the toasted bread was brushed (soaked) in butter. \n\nThe Rubin was tough and hard to eat.  The 4th person in our group ordered the bbq pork sandwich. He said it was good but certainly not worth coming back for.  Our water glasses were never refilled. Over all it is a thumbs down for all of us.   \n\nAs a positive the sweet potato fries were good.",0
3906,"While the title might be better suited for a Manhattan Chelsea night club, the allure of Jody Maroni's is an easy one here at Sky Harbor - everyone hates the typical airport food options but most folks (even vegans) love hot dogs.\n\nBut these hot dogs aren't even worthy of a Joey Chestnut or Kobayashi throw down. They often remind me of a layman's version of a Costco dog but cost nearly 4x as much. Sad to say I've eaten here more times than I'd like to admit, but there isn't a single dog I can recommend on the menu.\n\nI can however, digress somewhat on my experiences here, all of which included slow and lackadaisical service and were driven by the hope that each time would be better. I've had their chicken andouille dog, which was really just an overcooked hot dog served in a semi-toasted bun. Now substitute the chicken andouille with their bratwurst, polish dog, Louisiana boudin hot link, chicken apple, Chicago style dog, sweet Italian and you have the same result.\n\nThe biggest offender was their priciest option, the kobe beef dog, supposedly made of wagyu, the red meat from heaven, a gift from carnivore gods. Yet, even at $9 (airport prices, yikes) it still tasted like... just a Costco hot dog. Perhaps a tad juicier and an interesting snap to the casing but nothing mind blowing or back breaking but certainly wallet killing.\n\nIn the end, I mean Jodi Maroni no harm. After all, I've had a much more decent version of his hot dogs in other cities, but a little airport kiosk in a space full of commuters who are willing to pay the extra buck for (as Bourdain would coin it) \""""meat in tube form\"""" nourishment, is not going to be making anything revolutionary anytime soon.",0
3907,"This is the best hotel experience I've ever had in Vegas.  My fiance and I travel to Vegas about twice a year, but had not yet stayed at the Aria.  Upon checking in, we received a complimentary upgrade to a penthouse sky suite from a standard room!  On a weekend!  For three nights!  The room was unbelievable.  There were two bathrooms, a kitchen, living room, and dining room.  We had friends also visiting Vegas and, honestly, the four of us had more fun celebrating in our room than on the strip.  The master bath was enormous and featured a large sinking tub in the middle of it, a heated toilet seat with a built in bidet/dryer, and a huge glass shower with a steam-room feature.  The Aria hotel is beautiful and chic, conveniently located, with many delicious dining options (we ate at Julian Serrano, Javier's, and and Blossom- all fantastic), but it was the top-notch service we received that made our anniversary unforgettable.",1
3908,"I have had the same problem as other yelpers with the non stop calling.  ive asked to be removed from their calling list 3 separate occasions.  last night they called me past 9pm.

3909,"The BEST Filibertos, and I've eaten at them all as well as the *berto clones.  The meat never tastes like cat unlike at some of them and it's open 24 hours, inside too!

If you do go late you may encounter a line at the drive through because it's a hoppin place after everything else closes.",1

Went to the Sunday Brunch only because the hotels offer the $5 off per person (I now know why).  But if i had known how bad this place was I woulda said screw the discount.\n\nThe food was cold.  It looked days old. I definitely had to spit some of it out.\n\nRice was so dry it tasted like sand, Fajitas looked like and tasted like dog turd. Eggs were super watery. Their au jus tasted like armpit.  The \""""fresh\"""" crepes were newspaper tossed in some butter with canned strawberries inside.  And their bread pudding was basically egg with sugar.\n\nOn top of that every cook looked like they were miserable to be there, really if you dont enjoy what you do (especially when it comes to cooking) then what are you doing there?  The cooks' lack of enthusiasm to love what they do completely reflects on their food!\n\nAbsolutely do not recommend.

3914,"After hearing bad reviews about the staff, I still made the long trek from Verdun to get a great espresso pull. I entered around 3pm to see about 10 people in line and 15 or so sitting around the tables. I was immediately told to leave and that they were closing (after he let the local that held the door for me get in line). I told him I was in town from the US and was really looking forward to trying their coffee, had come over from Verdun, and would take my coffee to go. He very rudely told me that he has been working since 11am by himself and if I were in his shoes, I would understand. After pleading again, I was told to just leave. While I like to sympathize with people, working a 4 hour shift as a barista is most certainly not an excuse for being flat-out dismissive of your customers. That, sir, earns your business a poor rating on all the review sites I belong to. Should have listened to the others.",0
3915,My chicken parm was okay. But my mom ordered the salmon and that was amazing. My Aunts was also ok and why it only got 2 stars. I would expect for consistency especially with how prices all the food is. Having to track down your waiter is another reason for its low score,0

It was all really good. This will sound snobby and I can't do anything about it but, a lot of them weren't the traditional Spanish tapas or pintxos (Basque Country) we ate abroad, but still good. HOWEVER the ones that were traditional Spanish or Basque WERE AWESOME. I got completely nostalgic and felt like I was back there. If you can, try to go during happy hour (Monday-Sunday 3-6pm) otherwise you will leave with your wallet pretty worked out as they charge generally $5-8 per dish.",1

The kitchen does look dingy but I'm willing to overlook that because the food is so fantastic. The gentleman behind the burner is so quick and knows the recipes by heart, the son (I'm assuming) takes care of the orders and register and he is extremely kind. Everything is made to order even the hot & sour soup (which is the best I've ever had, seriously). I like to try new things each time I order but I'm stuck on the coconut curry tofu. Forget LuLu's, Howe Lee, New Dumpling House, and all of the other Chinese places, go to Zaw's instead.",1
3923,"Frankly, I am astounded this place has gotten the reviews it has.\n\nI guess, overall, its not an entirely hateful place.  I was able to get in immediately with a ladies VIP pass despite there being a huge crowd outside, and the music wasn't totally ridiculous.  I had a couple of drinks that were reasonably mixed and weren't too overpriced.  Um........ I think that's about it for the good things\n\nOn to the bad things - this place is freakin small man.  like ridiculous for a place calling itself a nightclub.  maybe it was the night i was there, about a week after their grand opening and on a Sunday, but it was so packed i don't think i even got on the actual dance floor till after 1am.  there was a stupid amount of females in there compared to males.  like other people have mentioned, the dress code was totally random.  i saw a lady, not a girl, a grown ass lady in there with some dirty aerobic walking shoes like she had been to every point on the strip that day.  craziness.  the bathroom is outside of the club, so not only did i put off going until the very last moment, but once i got there i had to force myself to go back into the club - the damn casino, with its free drinks, was right there calling.  and finally, maybe it's just me, but i never located this alleged patio outside area.  and no i don't drink that much, its just extremely dark in there and they had one security guy in particular i didn't feel like going near.  maybe that was the door outside, who knows.\n\nanyway, this would be a good place to start off a night, provided you were already in TI.  I guess if you had bottle service this joint wouldn't be so bad, those areas looked pretty decent and are not like right on top of the dance floor so you can enjoy yourselves.  i personally wouldn't make a special trip here though, even for free admission.",0

She was so sweet and she told us she was going through cosmetology school. Her service was EXCELLENT! Super kind and professional. She made my friend and I feel so comfortable. My eyebrows look awesome and my friend and I were in and out in under 20 mins or less. We went on Saturday around 11am (3/1/2014). The salon was clean and tidy.

We ordered #20 boiled, those are the shrimp, pork, egg, and leek dumplings and the #2 fried, those are the pork and mushroom. \n\nThe #20 were incredible, a light but flavorful taste and the boiling was the perfect choice. The dumplings didn't have that watery feel you get in some places either. The fried pork and mushroom arrived next and were a good counterpoint to the light #20s. The fried bottoms had a nice texture and went well with the flavors, but we agreed that maybe we should have ordered them boiled. They were still quite good.

They then offered to replace the steer wheel that they supposedly didn't damage at employee pricing with no labor.  Umm if you didn't do the damage why would you offer to do that.  The fact is that they knew they did the damage, but still tried to get into my pocket book for more money. It was very clear the gash was new because of the color and where it was at.

But she became incredibly agitated when my friend tried to get a book that was a bit higher than we could reach -- she insisted that he just put the book away altogether and escorted him out of the store, as if he had committed a crime. She then promptly turned to me and glowered, obviously wishing to kick me out as well. I was going to buy the book I had been skimming, but felt incredibly uncomfortable with how she was treating us.

There's also a potato bar.\n\nMy favorite section is the little pasta section where you can get some Mac n Cheese.\n\nNothing here is gourmet, so leave your fancy palates at home. \n\nSweet Tomatoes is just a fun, chill place to have a meal. Simple. Fun. Fast. Also, this is the same chain as Souplantation. A joint I used to frequent when I lived in Los Angeles.\n\nIf you are one of those weirdos who likes to bring your diet to a restaurant, I suppose they can accommodate you. Pile some raw vegetables on your plate. Whatever floats your boat, but if you are normal and can enjoy a meal like a decent human....this is a good place for that.",1
3944,"Xfinity is one of the buggiest systems I have experienced.  These are just a few examples that are at least weekly, and closer to daily.  The box announcing that a station selection has been switched to HD because of preference settings remains on screen, cannot be removed with the exit button or any other button, and the system has to be shut down and restarted.  The entire service needs rebooting every few days, and can take five minutes.   The program guide is so filled with station logos and search options, that simply scrolling down the programs easily overloads the system, causing either incomplete or hard to read information to appear, or the whole system to freeze.  The simple act of entering a station number via the remote is three times slower than the regular Comcast system, in part because entering a station number also initiates other searches.  And the remote is far more sensitive to distance from the box or direction in which it is pointed.  These are just a few of the bugs most often experienced.  True, Xfinity has capabilities not found in the earlier system, but unless you desperately want all of them, this is a terrible trade off for speed and reliability of simply catching some TV shows.  I have the system at no charge through a promotion, but will cancel it as soon as the penalty-for-cancellation period has expired,.",0

3946,"Let me start by saying two things - I agree with the previous post about the rates and caring nature of the staff.  However, we had a less than ideal experience when using Commonwealth Animal Hospital near the end of the life of one of our kitties.\n\nAt the advice of our regular vet (a traveling vet), we took our limping kitty to get an xray done.  The xray showed an old and healed hip fracture that probably occurred when she was a feral cat (before we adopted her).  However, they didn't note the mass in her pelvis.  She did not get better...and we made a new appointment, called for results, had to call back again because the doctor did not call back.  After several rounds of phone tag and visits, we ended up at a specialist.  When it was apparent that she had cancer and was near the end of her life, CAH was very compassionate in helping us make the decision to put her to sleep.    We decided to get her cremated, and they said they would handle it and let us know when her ashes were ready to be picked up.  About 2 weeks later, we got a bill from the crematorium.  When we called them, they said the ashes had been delivered to CAH well before the bill was mailed...and they never called us.  \n\nIn sum, they were very kind and sympathetic, but disorganized.  We could have known what was going on with our kitty much sooner and settled into the notion that she was dying.  And getting the bill before the ashes was really poor form.  I doubt if we will go back.",0

3952,"I spent eight nights in the Las Vegas Hotel for business.  Because of how the reservations worked out, I was in one room in the North Tower for four nights and one room in the Central Tower for four nights.  Those were totally different worlds.\n\nIN GENERAL:\nThe front desk area was nice, but there was almost always a wait for check-in, key pick-up, etc.  The front desk staff varied from nice to end-of-my-shift-grumpy.  They have a \""""Go Green\"""" program, which I thought was kinda cool.  If you don't want your room cleaned, press the \""""Go Green\"""" button on your phone and they'll slide a $10 hotel voucher under your door in the morning.  Score!  You can also check out from your room phone, which saved us some time.  \n\nWorst Paper Products Ever.  I know hotels aren't going to buy lovely Cottonelle and Puffs Plus for their rooms, but I'm not sure which was worse: the medium-grade sand paper tissues or the toilet paper that disintegrated on contact.  I never smelled cigarette smoke in the rooms, but every one of us got stuffed up noses the minute we walked in our rooms all week.  Something about the ventilation in the hotel is not right.  Also, there was a daily fee for WiFi access.  Boo hiss.  \n\nNORTH TOWER:\nI apparently got an upgraded room, which came with an extra sitting area.  There was a fridge, a nice tv, a couch, a couple of chairs, and a coffee table.  A colleague got a non-upgraded room across the hall, which was identical without the extra sitting area.  The room was super clean.  Everything looked pretty new, the carpet was in great condition, and the tile in the entryway and bathroom was gleaming.  Bathroom had a full-sized hair dryer and a garden tub.  Bed was super comfy, as part of the upgrade is an upgraded pillow-top mattress.  Other than the ventilation playing havoc with my sinuses, this was a great room.\n\nCENTRAL TOWER:\nObviously built before the North Tower, this wing has seen better days long ago.  The bedding seemed clean and the bed was comfy enough, but the room had a general \""""ick\"""" feel to it.  The carpet was very worn and stained.  There were a couple of used tissues on the floor behind the bathroom trash can.  The shower head was broken and flopped down, so I had to crouch and duck under it to wash.  No fridge.

The weather was beautiful last night, so thought we would ride the light rail to Tempe and enjoy some drinks and food on a patio.  I've always been intrigued by the Depot Cantina, so that is where we decided to go.  We found a nice table on the patio and we were off to a good start.  But, it all went downhill from there....the service was so terribly slow and she didn't really apologize for it.  It took us 15 minutes to get our drinks and then another 10 to get our food order in...only because I asked another server to help us.  They cranked the music too loud and it caused it to cut in and out.  We told multiple servers multiple times that if they turned the music down it would go back to normal...took 30 minutes for that to be fixed.  The food was just ok and the presentation was not impressive.  The soup was spilled all over the plate beneath it and they just threw a few tortillas on my friend's burro...seriously no attention to detail in this place.

Not only was the variety outstanding, but their popcorn might be the cheapest in town!  Didn't have a chance to try out the food, but looking forward to making it a meal next time!\n\nDrinks: Alcohol... and plenty (along with daily specials!).  Automatic win in my books.\n\nScreening Rooms:  Here's where the great and bad come into play.  I was ecstatic to see digital projection in room #4.  The image was super crisp from the get-go and the colours were vibrant (unlike the case at many other theatres).  The digital projection greatly enhanced the experience. The seats were also super comfy and reclined just perfectly!  The bad?  I have to admit I love Stadium Seating.  I was lucky in that the place wasn't crowded, but your view is automatically blocked (if only just a little) the second someone sits in front of you.\n\nI love this place and can't wait to go back for their amazing selection of hard-to-find film and great movie-going experience!",1

And oregano? It was treated more like a topping than a spice! Why is it many pizza joints think that good pizza should consist of large amounts of oregano? Oregano should enhance the flavor, not BE the flavor! \n\nNow, I have a high tolerance for crappy pizza; this pizza was horrible, in my opinion, and being charged for 3 toppings really turned me off.

3982,"Just got back home from here.......yup!  That's the best I can say about this place!  I made it out alive.....OK maybe that's a stretch but truly, eaters beware!  If you love poor quality canadianized Chinese food, this is your spot.  The food was mostly soggy, MSG-ed and was very limited in choice for your $18 (counted approx 24 items on the hot course buffet).  We had to wait around empty pans hoping someone would come out with something that was at least hot, and fresh enough to not have gone soggy from the copious amonts of oil being used here.  Having voiced all these complaints, the chicken wings were by far the very best thing on the buffet, the rice and chicken goo guy enjoyable, the rest won't make you sick but nothing you'll want to do again soon.\nWe ate here 10 years ago, it was exactly the same, I guess we figured that to still be in business after that long improvements must have been made...Nope!\nThe drinks were varied, interesting, delicious and fairly priced for their size, if you are ordering 'virgins' for the kids....VERY PRICEY!  They only take off $2 per drink, I should have told them to charge me the total and bring me the alcohol....the $6 I saved would have gotten me a pretty stiff drink! \nWe won't be back, unless of course we get a burning need to feed some of the 40+ turtles they have in their fountains!",0
3983,"If I could give this place negative stars I would. Years ago, there was an incident where they messed up our order, and instead of fixing the issue and having the driver come back with the right order I was told by the owner, \""""We are too busy tough luck.\"""" I can not make this up. He then called me sweat heart which I felt was very demeaning and sexist, so I called him an ass. Years later....years later, my boyfriend places an order and is told that we can not place one over the phone. He was told the only way they would take the order is if he placed it in the restaurant, according to the woman on the phone she said that is what the \""""note\"""" on the account said. I find that to be disturbing, why the hell does he need to go there, did they want to confront him? Also? They litter, horribly. I see their pieces of wasted paper all over where I work and live.  Obviously, they don't care about their reviews either. This place needs to be shut down, anyone reading this...please don't give them your business and hopefully they have to close shop.",0
3984,I would have rather stayed at the super 8 motel than this place ever again. I stayed here 3 years ago ANC the room itself was dirty and there was a unidentified red streak in the wall that looked like blood. It never rains in Vegas but the one time it did was when we were staying here and it was the most rainfall recorded in years... The room 2 doors down's ceiling collapsed and the whole floor smelled like mildew. Not one person checked up on us or anything and when we said something about the smell the didn't move us or anything. I will never stay here again and will tell everyone else not to either.,0
3985,"quite possibly the worst sushi I have ever had. I ordered spicy tuna don.   The tuna was spoiled, and the sauce was straight mayonnaise with no spice or flavor. This allowed me to really appreciate just how bad the fish was.  \n\nAt least it was a good portion size.  If you give bad food, at least give a lot of it so your customers really get sick.\n\nAddition from later same day, I was nauseous beginning 1 hour afterwards, lasting for several hours.",0
3986,"Express service department is amazing. Brought my Prelude for an oil change. They gave me an ET of completion of 35 minutes. Was in and out in 25! With a free car wash! They also notified me of an oil leak I had no idea I had. They brought me in the shop and showed me the leak to see for myself. In terms of the express service department, they're amazing! Will definitely come back!",1
3987,"Heaven...or 7-11....Hahahaha! Ok,  I thought that was pretty funny....cause it is the latter of the two. So, this is just your average, dirty, everything is about to expire, run in the wall 7-11. \n\nI know what your thinking....\""""But Tanya - you checked in here\"""" Guilty as charged. Sometimes a girl needs a twinkie and a coke to get her back on her feet. DON'T judge!\n\nWould I go out of my way to go back - no. Was I glad I stopped - yes.\n\n7 reasons to go, 11 reasons not too:)",0
3988,"I was so disappointed with my meal yesterday at Galanga Thai Eatery that I had to try to find some better Thai food today.  Prommares is closed on Sundays, so I took a chance with a new Thai restaurant, and I am so glad that I did!  This is a Thai restaurant that actually focuses on making people happy.  I haven't had service like this since I stopped eating at Thai Grill!  And the food is authentic and good too!  The waitress gave me my own fan even!\n\nAnyway, on to what really counts: the food.  I ordered a Thai iced tea, which wasn't as sweet as most places, but was good still.  I also ordered the duck curry, and sweet sticky rice with mango for desert.  \n\nAt $14, I initially thought the duck curry was a tad pricey, but when the dish was served I quickly realized that the portion of curry was quite generous, particularly in the duck department.  I was completely surprised at how tender the duck was.  I've never had duck at a Thai place this tender!  Yummy!  The yellow curry was soupy, just how I like it, with a unique, perhaps less bold than I prefer, taste.  I ordered a medium spice level, and it wasn't spicy enough, but this can always be remedied with Thai food.  Overall, a very good dish.  \n\nThe mango with sweet sticky rice was good to.  The waitress made sure I knew that the mango wasn't ripe and was going to be sour, so no complaints here... it was indeed sour, but the sweet sticky rice was quite nice.  \n\nI have no clue why this place only has two reviews.  I am tempted to give it five stars, but I can't yet say that Essence of Thai is on par with the (old) Thai Grill and Prommares.  I will definitely be coming back to try some of their other dishes though!",1
3989,"We were feeling courageous on a Friday night at 6pm to try and have dinner here, as it had been a while.  \n\nWe were lucky to get in right away, as there is usually a wait of about 30 minutes.  \n\nWe were seated and promptly served warm bread and drinks.  Our waitress was on top of it and she was pleasant, even though the restaurant was PACKED. \n\nThe app of grilled artichokes were brought out and about 10 minutes later our food.  The food is always good and generous portion sizes and reasonably priced.\n\nThe bf had the BBQ chicken pizza, which is always amazing but this time was especially good by his comments.\n\nI enjoyed the lettuce wrapped chicken tacos (asian).  \n\nOverall, this experience was as good as it usually is.  The only downside is the restaurant is always very VERY loud and table space is very small if you are not seated in a booth (we were not).\n\nFor a chain restaurant, this restaurant, especially this location is worth it.",1
3990,"Service: Slow! But very friendly.\n\nFood: The fish is always good, and they have a great selection of tacos.\n\nThe best: The patio! This is the best patio in the valley. You get great people watching, Light Rail watching, and sit in the beautiful Arizona night.\n\nGet the Pork Tacos. They are on the Happy Hour Menu, as well.",1
3991,"I frequent this establishment and generally ignore the poor service, but after my latest encounter they have lost me as a customer. I waited 30 min to even be acknowledged only to have longer waits for food and drinks. I have never had worse service.",0
3992,"I love how they open up the windows when it gets warm enough and have a beer garden up top.  They have good daily drink specials (Sharkbowls on Tuesdays!) and is kept very clean - and I don't just mean by campus bar standards!  During the day, it's also nice to sit by the open windows and grab some chow - just your typical bar food - but it can get pretty busy, especially for lunch.\n\nI remember getting a Sharkbowl for the first time on a barcrawl with co-workers: \""""Uh oh, these are really yummy\"""" =P  Needless to say, the fact that Firehaus was only the second stop on our list made sure that the rest of the night was comprised of a bunch of drunken debauchery.",1
3993,"What's not to like about Beach Hut Deli? Cool beach theme decoration, nice spacious interior and outdoor area, cold beer, delicious food, and large portions. Am I a fan?HELL YEAH!!\n\nYou can call them a \""""chain\"""" which is why I usually passed on the lunch invites, but I probably wouldn't now. If you did though think of a Subway or Quiznos but on steroids. I ordered The Pig Kahuna, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beach-hut-deli-las-vegas?select=rSBykeuQTeYDI_CPbuhaQg#rSBykeuQTeYDI_CPbuhaQg they should call it the Big Kahuna at least that's what I called it when I placed my order.  A pile of pulled pork covered in a sweet, kind of mild BBQ sauce, melted cheddar cheese, and chunks of pineapple in a French roll.  I had the hardest time picking up The Pig Kahuna and taking a bite that I started to use a fork and knife to attack it.  It was delicious and put a smile on my face. They have other healthier sandwiches and other dishes which seemed big also.\n\nThey also have daily happy hour specials which run from 3 pm to 6 pm. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beach-hut-deli-las-vegas?select=rSBykeuQTeYDI_CPbuhaQg#_G9o8Wiph6vpLOdvXc0u2g and the happiest hour 3 pm to 4 pm for $1 pints.  Did I mention that they have a lot of TV? Great place to watch a sporting event.",1
3994,"Fries were cold and greasy and flavorless. Hamburgers okay, not over the top like we were expecting. Got our drinks after we got our burgers. We left thinking Bobby would be pissed if he would have had the meal we had at his place!",0
3995,"The food and prices are amazing! The service was great, we had a group staying in the hotel next door and had about 30 person party roll in for brunch. They made everyone feel comfortable and welcomed. It didn't take long for the food to come out and I can't wait to eat here again.  This place is Canyon State Beard Club approved!",1
3996,"This is a small, no-nonsense creperie with a wide selection of items. I wanted to get something light and the associate at the counter was able to convert their Florentine Crepe into an omelet for me. The portion size was more than sufficient and the food tasted fresh. It's a great spot--very clean and they use compostable and recyclable cups, plates etc.",1
3997,Never again. The food is really good but the service is terrible. No utencils. How can you being me any glass with just ice when I asked for water. How is it possible that the waiter gives me the wrong plate because they don't know what kind of meet is on the plate. And they serve our food several minutes apart. This was their 2nd chance. We had to walk out the first time because they took our drink order and didn't return within 15 minutes.,0
3998,This place is very unorganized.  I will not be back.\n\nWe had to ask twice to get menus.  The pre-meal bread was cold.  Got the beverage near the end of the meal. They were out of the entree that my guest ordered. It took them 15 minutes to realize that and let us make another selection.\n\nThe sauce on the pasta I ordered was disgusting.  It tasted only slightly better than Chef Boyardee. \n\nAvoid this place and go to a better restaurant ...,0
3999,We have been here many times but tonight's ayce experience made us think about not going back there again. Food servers acted like they did not want us there. Felt like being rushed out. They missed a couple of our orders on the ayce list.  My last order was the dancing eel. It was not served to us yet and the waitress was already giving us the check. We felt like they wanted us out so we paid and left without getting our last order. Been in the food beverage industry for almost 10yrs. Would never treat my guests this way. Makes me sad since they have really good sushi. I,0
