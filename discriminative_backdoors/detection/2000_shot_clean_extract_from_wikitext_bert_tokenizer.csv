29," Cẩn was considered the most secular of the four Ngô brothers who controlled Vietnam 's domestic affairs .

38," In the first half of the 1880s , Stanford collaborated with the author Gilbert à Beckett on two operas , Savonarola , and The Canterbury Pilgrims . The former was well received at its premiere in Hamburg in April 1884 , but received a critical savaging when staged at Covent Garden in July of the same year . Parry commented privately , "" It seems very badly constructed for the stage , poorly conceived and the music , though clean and well @-@ managed , is not striking or dramatic . "" The most severe public criticism was in The Theatre , whose reviewer wrote , "" The book of Savonarola is dull , stilted , and , from a dramatic point of view , weak . It is not , however , so crushingly tiresome as the music fitted to it . Savonarola has gone far to convince me that opera is quite out of [ Stanford 's ] line and that the sooner he abandons the stage for the cathedral , the better for his musical reputation . "" The Canterbury Pilgrims had been premiered in London in April 1884 , three months before Savonarola was presented at Covent Garden . It had a better reception than the latter , though reviews pointed out Stanford 's debt to Die Meistersinger , and complained of a lack of emotion in the love music . George Grove agreed with the critics , writing to Parry , "" Charlie 's music contains everything but sentiment . Love not at all – that I heard not a grain of . ... And I do think that there might be more tune . Melody is not a thing to be avoided surely . "" In 1896 a critic wrote that the opera had "" just such a ' book ' as would have suited the late Alfred Cellier . He would probably have made of it a charming light English opera . But Dr. Stanford has chosen to use it for the exemplification of those advanced theories which we know him to hold , and he has given us music which would incline us to think that Die Meistersinger had been his model . The effect of the combination is not happy . "" ",0

49," The title of the book suggests a pilgrimage , and yet the narrator does not stray far from her home near the creek : the journey is metaphysical . Margaret Loewen Reimer , in one of the first critical studies based on the book , noted that Dillard 's treatment of the metaphysical is similar to that of Herman Melville .

61," Standing 188 cm , Johnston had a smooth ten @-@ pace approach to the wicket , with an idiosyncratic dip of his head before the instant of delivery . He had success on moist English pitches , with deliveries from over the wicket because of the increased chances of leg before wicket decisions and to induce edges from balls angling across the batsmen .

Carl Michael translated a French book by Du Four and dedicated it to his uncle , but the hint was ignored . Deep in debt , at the end of 1757 the family sent Carl Michael to the State Bank as an unpaid trainee . He had no aptitude for numbers , instead discovering the taverns and brothels which were to figure so largely in his songs . ",1

After spending several hours over cold waters , most of the convection associated with Hondo dissipated due to the lack of energy and the storm was further downgraded to a moderate tropical storm . Later that day , no convection remained around the storm as it weakened to a tropical depression . The JTWC issued their final advisory on February 12 as the storm showed no signs of convective activity . Hondo degenerated into a remnant @-@ low pressure area as Météo @-@ France issued their final advisory at 1200 UTC .

99," South Dakota can generally be divided into three regions : eastern South Dakota , western South Dakota , and the Black Hills . The Missouri River serves as a boundary in terms of geographic , social , and political differences between eastern and western South Dakota . The geography of the Black Hills , long considered sacred ground by Native Americans , differs from its surroundings to such an extent that it can be considered separate from the rest of western South Dakota . At times the Black Hills are combined with the rest of western South Dakota , and people often refer to the resulting two regions divided by the Missouri River as West River and East River . ",1
100," Nagumo was now in a quandary . Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi , leading Carrier Division 2 ( Hiryū and Sōryū ) , recommended that Nagumo strike immediately with the forces at hand : 18 Aichi [UNK] dive bombers each on Sōryū and Hiryū , and half the ready cover patrol aircraft . Nagumo 's opportunity to hit the American ships was now limited by the imminent return of his Midway strike force . The returning strike force needed to land promptly or it would have to ditch into the sea . Because of the constant flight deck activity associated with combat air patrol operations during the preceding hour , the Japanese never had an opportunity to position ( "" spot "" ) their reserve planes on the flight deck for launch .

102," The proposal to build a wind farm , in a joint venture between United Utilities and Peel Holdings , was announced in 2003 . Shortly afterwards a pressure group , The Friends of Scout and Knowle Moor , was formed , and on 9 September 2003 representatives of the group attended a meeting of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury 's , Ramsbottom and Tottington Area Board to oppose the plans . At the meeting , the spokesperson for the group said that , although they supported the use of alternative energy , they felt that this was the wrong area . Among the objections were that the scheme was contrary to the Unitary Development Plan and the Green Belt , and would adversely affect common land , open countryside and areas of ecological importance and special landscape value . The group also considered that the proposed development would be out of scale with the landscape , adversely affecting peat , water courses and wildlife , and would have a seriously detrimental visual impact , as well as causing a noise nuisance .

104," There were several challenges in building the Vine Street Expressway between 18th Street and the Ben Franklin Bridge . The road was to run through developed areas of Philadelphia , intersecting several streets and railroad lines . In addition , the route was to run through Franklin Square , a historically sensitive site , to connect to the Ben Franklin Bridge . As a result , the routing was modified in 1966 to avoid many of these obstacles . The route was to avoid running through Franklin Square , leading to the eastbound direction using surface streets to access the Ben Franklin Bridge , and a planned connector to Market Street was removed . In the 1970s , the proposed freeway ’ s environmental impact statement had to be evaluated again per new guidelines ; when the new environmental impact statement was issued in 1977 , it was found that more improvements were needed for mass transit in the area of the planned freeway . To comply with this , provisions were made concerning the proposed underground Center City Commuter Connection for SEPTA Regional Rail , in which the railroad tracks would pass under I @-@ 676 and residences would be built over the railroad tunnel in Chinatown . Construction was approved in 1986 on the Vine Street Expressway from 18th Street to the Ben Franklin Bridge , with no provisions for elevated connections between the Ben Franklin Bridge and the Vine Street Expressway to avoid disturbing Franklin Square . This portion of the Vine Street Expressway opened to traffic on January 10 , 1991 , completing I @-@ 676 . ",0

111," Orientalism concluded that Western writing about "" The Orient "" depicts the Oriental culture as an irrational , weak and feminized "" Other "" , an existential condition greatly contrasted with the rational , strong and masculine culture of the "" West .

115," Although NY 99 was signed as a state highway , maintenance on the route was performed by Franklin County , which designated the roadway as CR 26 . All of NY 99 was initially a gravel road ; however , most of the road was paved in the early 1970s through the use of state funds procured by New York State Senator Ronald Stafford of Plattsburgh . The western and eastern extents of the road were paved soon afterward ; however , the road was left unpaved in the vicinity of Loon Lake — a lake near the midpoint of the route — even though the necessary gravel base was applied to the entire highway .

119," During the Victorian era , Clevedon became a popular seaside town , having previously been an agricultural village . Due to improving transport links , via the Clevedon Branch Line , Clevedon was able to cater for the late 19th century craze for bathing in the sea with saltwater baths adjacent to the pier ( since demolished , though the foundations can still be seen ) , and bathing machines on the main beach . Many English seaside resorts built piers in the 1850s to attract tourists . At Clevedon tourism grew following the opening of a branch line from Yatton railway station which connected it to the Bristol to Exeter Line , enabling travel from the rest of the country . It was also proposed that a pier could form part of a route from London to South Wales with the use of steamers to cross the Severn Estuary . An enabling act was submitted to parliament in 1864 . ",1

Over the next decade , Congress approved building multiple modern armored cruisers and battleships , and by around the start of the 20th century had moved from twelfth place in 1870 to fifth place in terms of numbers of ships . After winning two major battles during the 1898 Spanish – American War , the Navy continued to build more ships , and by the end of World War I had more men and women in uniform than the Royal Navy . The Washington Naval Conference recognized the Navy as equal in capital ship size to the Royal Navy , and during the 1920s and 1930s , the Navy built several aircraft carriers and battleships . The Navy was drawn into World War II after the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 , and over the next four years fought many historic battles including the Battle of the Coral Sea , the Battle of Midway , multiple naval battles during the Guadalcanal Campaign , and the largest naval battle in history , the Battle of Leyte Gulf .

131," In October , with the war largely lost , Scheer and Hipper envisioned one last major fleet advance to attack the British Grand Fleet . Scheer intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy , to achieve a better bargaining position for Germany regardless of the cost to the navy . The plan involved two simultaneous attacks by light cruisers and destroyers , one on Flanders and another on shipping in the Thames estuary ; the five battlecruisers were to support the Thames attack while the dreadnoughts remained off Flanders .

160," In a cellular automaton , each cell in an infinite grid of cells may have one of a finite set of states , and all cells update their states simultaneously based only on the configuration of a small set of neighboring cells . A Life @-@ like cellular automaton rule is one in which the grid is the infinite square lattice , there are exactly two cell states , the set of neighbors of each cell are the eight neighbors of the Moore neighborhood , and the update rule depends only on the number of neighbors with each of the two states rather than on any more complicated function of those states .

345," The 18th Armoured Regiment disembarked at Taranto on 22 October 1943 and gradually travelled north towards the Sangro River , which it duly crossed on 3 December . In the following weeks , the regiment supported the 5th and 6th Brigades in their attack on Orsogna , as part of the Moro River Campaign . Although the infantry made some gains , the German defences were too strong and the attack soon faded into a stalemate , with a number of back and forth actions as winter set in , which led to many of the regiment 's tanks becoming stuck in the sodden ground . Offensive operations around Orsogna ceased in late December and the New Zealanders withdrew from the area on 13 January 1944 . ",0

351," Construction on the Brookville Tunnel , or the "" middle "" or "" second tunnel "" as it was then called , was begun sometime between 1849 and 1851 . The earth encountered at Brookville was of a much weaker quality than at the Greenwood Tunnel , rendering the digging of the tunnel both an extremely dangerous and difficult task . Although the eastern section of the ridge was composed of firm and sturdy rock , the majority of the tunnel passed through a mixture of frail slate that was formed at a steep angle , soapstone , and clay . When exposed to air , this mixture would often disintegrate causing large amounts of earth to fall into the tunnel bore . On two occasions during the tunnel 's construction , though great care was taken to provide temporary support , major cave @-@ ins occurred forming craters on top of the ridge , as much as 150 feet ( 46 m ) above the tunnel . Another slide occurred on the outside of the western portal that blocked the entrance to the tunnel and prevented workers from repairing the damage from the two internal cave @-@ ins . Rocks often fell down upon the timbers under which the men worked , creating sounds described as "" resembling that of distant thunder "" . The weakness of the earth , especially in the western sections , necessitated the implementation of a strong arch throughout approximately 500 feet ( 150 m ) of the tunnel and a durable brick lining . Crozet described the nature of the work on the tunnel in an 1854 letter : ",0

The Golden Horse had been engaged by HMS Adventure , under the command of Captain William Booth , and when the Nonsuch arrived on the scene the Golden Horse surrendered . A dispute then arose over the question of the prize money and how it should be shared out , and comments were made amongst the Nonsuch 's crew against those of the Adventure .

When William attempted to enter York on 9 May 1154 , Robert , along with Osbert de Bayeux , tried to prevent his entry , but their attempt was unsuccessful and they then went to Theobald of Bec , the Archbishop of Canterbury , and appealed in vain against William 's actions . It is possible that Robert feared that William would remove Robert from the deanship . After William 's death , Robert , once more acting with Osbert , pressured the cathedral chapter of York to elect Stephen 's choice of Roger de Pont L 'Évêque as the new Archbishop of York . Osbert was later accused of poisoning William , and was deprived of his office and clerical status when he could not clear himself from the accusation . Although Robert was associated with Osbert 's opposition to William , there is no evidence that Robert was ever thought to have been involved in the possible poisoning of William . ",0

Both began organizing a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961 , with people such as Marcel Duchamp and Peggy Guggenheim attending , and both Ono and Young claimed to have been the primary curator of these events , with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young . The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono 's earliest conceptual artwork , including Painting to Be Stepped On , which was a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork upon the accrual of footprints . With that work , Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible .

376," The cyclol fabric was shown to be implausible for several reasons . Hans Neurath and Henry Bull showed that the dense packing of side chains in the cyclol fabric was inconsistent with the experimental density observed in protein films .

[UNK] showed chemically that the outside of proteins could not have a large number of hydroxyl groups , a key prediction of the cyclol model , whereas Meyer and [UNK] showed that cyclol condensations of amino acids did not exist even in minute quantities as a transition state . More general chemical arguments against the cyclol model were given by Bergmann and Niemann and by Neuberger . Infrared spectroscopic data showed that the number of carbonyl groups in a protein did not change upon hydrolysis , and that intact , folded proteins have a full complement of amide carbonyl groups ; both observations contradict the cyclol hypothesis that such carbonyls are converted to hydroxyl groups in folded proteins . Finally , proteins were known to contain proline in significant quantities ( typically 5 % ) ; since proline lacks the amide hydrogen and its nitrogen already forms three covalent bonds , proline seems incapable of the cyclol reaction and of being incorporated into a cyclol fabric . An encyclopedic summary of the chemical and structural evidence against the cyclol model was given by Pauling and Niemann . Moreover , a supporting piece of evidence — the result that all proteins contain an integer multiple of 288 amino @-@ acid residues — was likewise shown to be incorrect in 1939 . ",0

The Yugoslav People 's Army ( Serbian : Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) confiscated Croatia 's Territorial Defence ( Croatian : Teritorijalna obrana – TO ) weapons to minimize resistance .

The request was denied and a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March prompted the JNA itself to ask the Federal Presidency to give it wartime authority and declare a state of emergency . Even though the request was backed by Serbia and its allies , the JNA request was refused on 15 March . Serbian President Slobodan Milošević , preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia with Croatia as a federal unit , publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency .

By the end of March , the conflict had escalated with the first fatalities . In early April , leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention to amalgamate the areas under their control with Serbia .

417," Chapter X examines whether patterns in the fossil record are better explained by common descent and branching evolution through natural selection , than by the individual creation of fixed species . Darwin expected species to change slowly , but not at the same rate – some organisms such as Lingula were unchanged since the earliest fossils . The pace of natural selection would depend on variability and change in the environment . This distanced his theory from Lamarckian laws of inevitable progress . It has been argued that this anticipated the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis , but other scholars have preferred to emphasise Darwin 's commitment to gradualism . He cited Richard Owen 's findings that the earliest members of a class were a few simple and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms , and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms , matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor . Patterns of extinction matched his theory , with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction , then not reappearing . Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras , and as he had seen in South America , and William Clift had shown in Australia , fossils from recent geological periods resembled species still living in the same area .

Chaco is one of the few natural regions in the world located between tropical and temperate latitudes that is not a desert . Precipitation and temperature are relatively homogeneous throughout the region . The general atmospheric circulation influences the climate of the region , primarily by two permanent high pressure systems - the South Pacific High and the South Atlantic High - and a low pressure system that develops over northeast Argentina called the Chaco Low . The interaction between the South Atlantic High and the Chaco Low generates a pressure gradient that brings moist air from the east and northeast to eastern coastal and central regions of Argentina . In summer , this interaction strengthens , favouring the development of convective thunderstorms that can result in heavy rainfall . In contrast , winters are dry due to these systems weakening , and the lower insolation that weakens the Chaco Low , and the northward displacement of westerly winds . During the entire year , the South Pacific High influences the climate by bringing cold , moist air masses originating in Patagonia leading to cold temperatures and frost , particularly during winter . Summers feature more stable weather than winter since the South Atlantic and South Pacific highs are at their southernmost positions , making the entrance of cold fronts more difficult . ",1

648," Most scholars do not currently believe that the Catalogue should be considered the work of Hesiod , but questions about the poem 's authenticity have not lessened its interest for the study of literary , social and historical topics . As a Hesiodic work that treats in depth the Homeric world of the heroes , the Catalogue offers a transition between the divine sphere of the Theogony and the terrestrial focus of the Works and Days by virtue of its subjects ' status as demigods . Given the poem 's concentration upon heroines in addition to heroes , it provides evidence for the roles and perceptions of women in Greek literature and society during the period of its composition and popularity . Greek aristocratic communities , the ruling elite , traced their lineages back to the heroes of epic poetry ; thus the Catalogue , a veritable "" map of the Hellenic world in genealogical terms , "" preserves much information about a complex system of kinship associations and hierarchies that continued to have political importance long after the Archaic period . Many of the myths in the Catalogue are otherwise unattested , either entirely so or in the form narrated therein , and held a special fascination for poets and scholars from the late Archaic period through the Hellenistic and Roman eras .

664," Walton 's next major composition was the massive choral cantata Belshazzar 's Feast ( 1931 ) . It began as a work on a modest scale ; the BBC commissioned a piece for small chorus , orchestra of no more than fifteen players , and soloist . Osbert Sitwell constructed a text , selecting verses from several books of the Old Testament and the Book of Revelation . As Walton worked on it , he found that his music required far larger forces than the BBC proposed to allow , and Beecham rescued him by programming the work for the 1931 Leeds Festival , to be conducted by Malcolm Sargent . Walton later recalled Beecham as saying , "" As you 'll never hear the work again , my boy , why not throw in a couple of brass bands ? "" During early rehearsals , the Leeds chorus members found Walton 's music difficult to master , and it was falsely rumoured in London musical circles that Beecham had been obliged to send Sargent to Leeds to quell a revolt . The first performance was a triumph for the composer , conductor and performers . A contemporary critic wrote , "" Those who experienced the tremendous impact of its first performance had full justification for feeling that a great composer had arisen in our land , a composer to whose potentialities it was impossible to set any limits .

The judges of the Court of Common Pleas and King 's Bench declared this to be illegal , and the Chief Justice Sir Ranulph Crewe was dismissed ; at this , the remaining judges succumbed to the king 's pressure . More and more people refused to pay , leading to Darnell 's Case , in which the courts confirmed that "" if no cause was given for the detention ... the prisoner could not be freed as the offence was probably too dangerous for public discussion "" . The result of this was that wealthy landowners refused to pay the loan and the Crown 's income fell below Charles 's expectations , forcing him to call a fresh Parliament in March 1627 .

Although she had no daughters , and gave birth to a son ( Guy Johnson ) , which she called "" the best thing that ever happened to me in my life "" , many women in Angelou 's career looked to her as a mother figure .

According to writer Gary Younge of The Guardian , most of the essays "" end with the kind of wisdom that , depending on your taste , qualifies as either homespun or hokey "" . For example , she uses what has been called her most famous statement , when speaking of Cuban artist Celia Cruz : "" We are more alike than unalike "" . Although Angelou discounts the idea when he brings it up to her , Younge thinks Letter reads like an extended farewell ; in her 500 @-@ word introduction she mentions death twice . ",1

The protectionism was the result of the desire of native French breeders to protect their interests against imports from the French colonies . The law was named after Edward [UNK] , a politician from Calvados , who argued that the law was supportive of French agriculture , and especially the Anglo @-@ Norman breed . He called the Anglo @-@ Norman a "" horse of the time ... suitable for all services . "" He said that they were useful for both riding and driving , and sought after by both military and commercial interests . The law significantly increased national breeding standards and encouraged the production of half @-@ blood horses , especially Anglo @-@ Normans , for military use . The development of the Anglo @-@ Norman saddle horse breed had long been delayed by a focus on the production of fashionable carriage horses . This resulted in the military imposing major breeding changes on breeders , who were often unaware of the jobs their horses performed for the military . However , conflict between breeders and the military often resulted from disagreements over breeding aims . ",1

1158," There is a variation in the rate and extent of recovery . The prognosis of Guillain – Barré syndrome is determined mainly by age ( those over 40 may have a poorer outcome ) , and by the severity of symptoms after two weeks . Furthermore , those who experienced diarrhea before the onset of disease have a worse prognosis . On the nerve conduction study , the presence of conduction block predicts poorer outcome at 6 months . In those who have received intravenous immunoglobulins , a smaller increase in IgG in the blood two weeks after administration is associated with poorer mobility outcomes at six months than those whose IgG level increased substantially . If the disease continues to progress beyond four weeks , or there are multiple fluctuations in the severity ( more than two in eight weeks ) , the diagnosis may be chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy which is treated differently .

1202," Throughout his 1993 autobiography A World Elsewhere , Hordern exhibited his pride on being able to play a wide range of parts , something which made him a frequent subject among theatrical critics . The author Martin Banham thought that many of Hordern 's characters shared a general identity of "" an absent @-@ minded , good @-@ hearted English eccentric "" . The American journalist Mel Gussow , writing in Hordern 's obituary in The New York Times in 1995 , described the actor as being "" a classical actor with the soul of a clown "" , while the actors John Hurt and Michael Bryant described Hordern as being "" the Austin Princess among British actors "" , which implied to the author Sheridan Morley that Hordern possessed an element of "" reliability but [ with ] a faint lack of charisma "" . Morley , who wrote Hordern 's biography for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography , went on to describe the actor as being "" one of the great eccentrics of his profession , perched perilously somewhere half way between Alistair Sim and Alec Guinness "" .

1203," For several decades , official British policy was to maintain strong ties with Mexico in the hopes that the country could stop the United States from expanding further . When the Texas Revolution erupted , Great Britain had declined to become involved , officially expressing confidence that Mexico could handle its own affairs . In 1840 , after years in which the Republic of Texas was neither annexed by the United States nor reabsorbed into Mexico , Britain signed a treaty to recognize the nation and act as a mediator to help Texas gain recognition from Mexico .

1204," The Court declined to accept Malaysia 's argument that the Singapore Colonial Secretary 's query about the status of Pedra Branca in 1953 indicated that the United Kingdom had no conviction that the island was part of its territory . It felt the letter of inquiry showed the Singapore authorities were not clear about events that had occurred over a century earlier and that they were unsure their records were complete , which was understandable in the circumstances . It also disagreed that the Acting State Secretary of Johor , who had stated in his letter of reply that Johor did not claim ownership of the island , had acted without authority . The Johor Agreement was irrelevant – as the Colonial Secretary was a representative of the United Kingdom government which was not a foreign state in relation to Johor at the time , there was no question of the United Kingdom having to consent to Johor issuing the reply . The Federation of Malaya Agreement also did not assist Malaysia because the action of responding to a request for information was not an "" exercise "" of "" executive authority "" . Further , since Malaysia had not invoked this argument in its negotiations with Singapore and in the ICJ proceedings until late in the oral phase , Singapore was entitled to presume that the Acting State Secretary had acted within his authority . The meaning of the reply was clear – as of 1953 , Johor understood it did not have sovereignty over Pedra Branca , and thus the Singapore authorities had no reason to doubt that the island belonged to the United Kingdom .

In many industrialized countries the prevalence of fluorosis is increasing even in unfluoridated communities , mostly because of fluoride from swallowed toothpaste . A 2009 systematic review indicated that fluorosis is associated with consumption of infant formula or of water added to reconstitute the formula , that the evidence was distorted by publication bias , and that the evidence that the formula 's fluoride caused the fluorosis was weak . In the U.S. the decline in tooth decay was accompanied by increased fluorosis in both fluoridated and unfluoridated communities ; accordingly , fluoride has been reduced in various ways worldwide in infant formulas , children 's toothpaste , water , and fluoride @-@ supplement schedules .

1247," In 1982 the future of the Chesham line came into serious question , as it became clear that the two bridges carrying the line into Chesham were deteriorating badly and that , unless the bridges were replaced , the branch could not continue to operate after 1986 .

Angered that the government had incurred this sizable expense without consulting the legislature , Conservative leader David Duggan introduced a motion calling on Aberhart to be hired in a similar capacity . This suited Reid , who hoped that by inducing both men to submit detailed plans he would at last have something concrete from Aberhart to attack , and something equally concrete from Douglas with which to contrast it . Aberhart confounded Reid 's plan by declining his offer . Douglas , for his part , provided mixed results : on his way to Edmonton he publicly repudiated Aberhart 's impugned pamphlet and also pronounced himself against the creation of a provincial social credit political vehicle . On the other hand , shortly after his arrival he sent Aberhart a letter , gleefully released by Aberhart , asserting that there was no conflict between the "" Douglas "" and "" Aberhart "" versions of social credit . Moreover , his interim report to the government concerned itself primarily with political and legal , rather than economic , realities : he recommended setting up a provincially controlled media outlet to counter the anti @-@ social credit propaganda he anticipated from the privately owned press , organizing a provincial government credit institution , and accumulating a stockpile of currency , stocks , and bonds . He also suggested that the UFA might need to form a coalition government to implement social credit . The report was of little use to Reid 's government , so he had his Attorney @-@ General , John Lymburn , ask Douglas to critique one of Aberhart 's radio broadcasts . Douglas demurred , and made only vague comments about minor technical errors in the transcript . ",0

1359," Worcester Cathedral , unlike Salisbury , has important parts of the building dating from every century from the 11th to the 16th . The earliest part of the building at Worcester is the multi @-@ columned Norman crypt with cushion capitals remaining from the original monastic church begun by St Wulfstan in 1084 . Also from the Norman period is the circular chapter house of 1120 , made octagonal on the outside when the walls were reinforced in the 14th century . The nave was built and rebuilt piecemeal and in different styles by several different architects over a period of 200 years , some bays being a unique and decorative transition between Norman and Gothic . It dates from 1170 to 1374 . The east end was rebuilt over the Norman crypt by Alexander Mason between 1224 and 1269 , coinciding with , and in a very similar Early English style to the greater part of Salisbury . From 1360 John [UNK] finished off the nave , built its vault , the west front , the north porch and the eastern range of the cloister . He also strengthened the Norman chapter house , added buttresses and changed its vault . His masterpiece is the central tower of 1374 , originally supporting a timber , lead @-@ covered spire , now gone . Between 1404 and 1432 an unknown architect added the north and south ranges to the cloister , which was eventually closed by the western range by John Chapman , 1435 – 38 .

1363," Academically Quisling proved talented in humanities , particularly history , and natural sciences ; he specialised in mathematics . At this point , however , his life had no clear direction . In 1905 , Quisling enrolled at the Norwegian Military Academy , having received the highest entrance examination score of the 250 applicants that year . Transferring in 1906 to the Norwegian Military College , he graduated with the highest score since the college 's inception in 1817 , and was rewarded by an audience with the King . On 1 November 1911 , he joined the army General Staff . Norway was neutral in the First World War ; Quisling detested the peace movement , though the high human cost of the war did temper his views . In March 1918 , he was sent to Russia as an attaché at the Norwegian legation in Petrograd , to take advantage of the five years he had spent studying the country . Though dismayed at the living conditions he experienced , Quisling nonetheless concluded that "" the Bolsheviks have got an extraordinarily strong hold on Russian society "" and marvelled at how Leon Trotsky had managed to mobilise Red Army forces so well ; by contrast , in granting too many rights to the people of Russia , the Russian Provisional Government under Alexander Kerensky had brought about its own downfall . When the legation was recalled in December 1918 , Quisling became the Norwegian military 's expert on Russian affairs . ",1

1365," Catechisms produced in specific dioceses from the mid @-@ fourteenth century emphasized the Commandments and laid the foundation for the first official Church @-@ wide catechism , the 1566 Roman Catechism . Commissioned by the Council of Trent , it provided "" thorough discussions of each commandment "" but gave greater emphasis to the seven sacraments to emphasize the Catholic belief that Christian life was dependent upon the grace solely obtained through the sacramental life provided by the Catholic Church . This emphasis conflicted with Protestant beliefs , which held the Commandments as the source of divine grace . While more recent papal encyclicals offer interpretations of Church teaching on individual commandments , throughout history official Church teachings on the Commandments are based on their mentions in the Old and New Testaments and the writings of the early Church Fathers Origen , Irenaeus and Augustine . Later , theologians Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure offered notable commentaries on the Commandments .

1372," The Point juts into the sea on a north @-@ facing coast , which means that migrant birds may be found in spring and autumn , sometimes in huge numbers when the weather conditions force them towards land . Numbers are relatively low in spring , but autumn can produce large "" falls "" , such as the hundreds of European robins on 1 October 1951 or more than 400 common redstarts , on 18 September 1995 . The common birds are regularly accompanied by scarcer species like greenish warblers , great grey shrikes or Richard 's pipits . Seabirds may be sighted passing the Point , and migrating waders feed on the marshes at this time of year . Vagrant rarities have turned up when the weather is appropriate , including a Fea 's or Zino 's petrel in 1997 , a trumpeter finch in 2008 , and an alder flycatcher in 2010 . Ornithologist and pioneering bird photographer Emma Turner started ringing common terns on the Point in 1909 , and the use of this technique for migration studies has continued since . A notable recovery was a Sandwich tern killed for food in Angola , and a Radde 's warbler trapped for ringing in 1961 was only the second British record of this species at that time . In the winter , the marshes hold golden plovers and wildfowl including common shelduck , Eurasian wigeon , brent geese and common teal , while common scoters , common eiders , common goldeneyes and red @-@ breasted mergansers swim offshore .

1381," Rita ( Laura Elena Harring ) is the mysterious and helpless apparent victim , a classic femme fatale with her dark , strikingly beautiful appearance . Roger Ebert was so impressed with Harring that he said of her "" all she has to do is stand there and she is the first good argument in 55 years for a Gilda remake "" . She serves as the object of desire , directly oppositional to Betty 's bright self @-@ assuredness . She is also the first character with whom the audience identifies , and as viewers know her only as confused and frightened , not knowing who she is and where she is going , she represents their desire to make sense of the film through her identity . Instead of threatening , she inspires Betty to nurture , console and help her . Her amnesia makes her a blank persona , that one reviewer notes is "" the vacancy that comes with extraordinary beauty and the onlooker 's willingness to project any combination of angelic and devilish onto her "" . A character analysis of Rita asserts that her actions are the most genuine of the first portion of the film , since she has no memory and nothing to use as a frame of reference for how to behave . Todd McGowan , however , author of a book on themes in Lynch 's films , states that the first portion of Mulholland Drive can be construed as Rita 's fantasy , until Diane Selwyn is revealed ; Betty is the object that overcomes Rita 's anxiety about her loss of identity .

1414," Higinbotham designed a game that used an oscilloscope to display the path of a simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from the side . The attached computer calculated the path of the ball and reversed its path when it hit the ground . The game also simulated the ball hitting the net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance . Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer , each consisting of a button and a knob . Pressing the button hit the ball , and turning a knob controlled the angle of the shot . Originally , Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity of the shot , but decided it would make the controller too complicated . The device was designed in a few hours with the help of colleague Dave Potter and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak .

The first Hebrew cookbook , written by Erna Meyer , and published in the early 1930s by the Palestine Federation of the Women 's International Zionist Organization ( [UNK] ) , exhorted cooks to use Mediterranean herbs and Middle Eastern spices and local vegetables in their cooking . The bread , olives , cheese and raw vegetables they adopted became the basis for the kibbutz breakfast , which in more abundant forms is served in Israeli hotels , and in various forms in most Israeli homes today .

1450," Subarachnoid blood can be detected on CT scanning in as many as 60 percent of people with traumatic brain injury . Traumatic SAH ( [UNK] ) usually occurs near the site of a skull fracture or intracerebral contusion . It usually happens in the setting of other forms of traumatic brain injury and has been linked with a poorer prognosis . It is unclear , however , if this is a direct result of the SAH or whether the presence of subarachnoid blood is simply an indicator of severity of the head injury and the prognosis is determined by other associated mechanisms .

1455," However , four days before it was scheduled to be built , Tydeman determined the structure design was too high to withstand the winds , and that there was a risk that it could topple along with the Soldiers ' & Sailors ' Monument . Tydeman resigned from the project to protect his company from possibly liability , but helped the committee come up with a new , safer design . The committee considered piercing the plywood panels to allow wind to travel through , but Jones said "" some of the wood could have splintered apart and taken someone 's head off "" . Jones called A.P. Heller , the Reading @-@ based company that built the Soldiers ' & Sailors ' Monument , and sought advice from the son of the man who owned the firm when the work was done .

1459," The recognised metalloids can be obtained by chemical reduction of either their oxides or their sulfides . Simpler or more complex extraction methods may be employed depending on the starting form and economic factors . Boron is routinely obtained by reducing the trioxide with magnesium : B2O3 + 3 Mg → 2 B + [UNK] ; after secondary processing the resulting brown powder has a purity of up to 97 % . Boron of higher purity ( > 99 % ) is prepared by heating volatile boron compounds , such as [UNK] or BBr3 , either in a hydrogen atmosphere ( 2 [UNK] + 3 H2 → 2 B + 6 HX ) or to the point of thermal decomposition . Silicon and germanium are obtained from their oxides by heating the oxide with carbon or hydrogen : SiO2 + C → Si + CO2 ; GeO2 + 2 H2 → Ge + 2 H2O . Arsenic is isolated from its pyrite ( [UNK] ) or [UNK] pyrite ( [UNK] ) by heating ; alternatively , it can be obtained from its oxide by reduction with carbon : 2 As2O3 + 3 C → 2 As + 3 CO2 . Antimony is derived from its sulfide by reduction with iron : Sb2S3 → 2 Sb + 3 FeS . Tellurium is prepared from its oxide by dissolving it in aqueous NaOH , yielding tellurite , then by electrolytic reduction : TeO2 + 2 NaOH → Na2TeO3 + H2O ; Na2TeO3 + H2O → Te + 2 NaOH + O2 . Another option is reduction of the oxide by roasting with carbon : TeO2 + C → Te + CO2 . ",0

1461," The idea of hosting the 1967 World Exhibition dates back to 1956 , but it was in 1958 that Conservative Senator Mark [UNK] suggested during his speech at the Brussels Exhibition that Canada should host a World Exhibition to celebrate its centennial . The exposition was offered first to Toronto but politicians there rejected the idea . However , Montreal 's mayor , Sarto Fournier , backed the proposal , allowing Canada to make a bid to the Bureau International des Expositions ( BIE ) . At the BIE 's May 5 , 1960 meeting in Paris , Moscow was awarded the fair after five rounds of voting that eliminated Austria 's and then Canada 's bids . In April 1962 , the Soviets scrapped plans to host the fair because of financial constraints and security concerns . Montreal 's new mayor , Jean Drapeau , lobbied the Canadian government to try again for the fair , which they did .

"" All the same , his grades were good enough to win a place at Rhodes University College , in Grahamstown , South Africa , which was often attended by Rhodesian students , partly because Rhodesia then had no university of its own , and partly because of the common eponymous association with Cecil Rhodes . Smith enrolled at the start of 1938 , reading for a Bachelor of Commerce degree . After injuring his knee playing rugby , he took up rowing and became stroke for the university crew . ",1
1466," Marine Harvest 's operations have been severely affected in the south of Chile , where millions of fish have died by the disease infectious salmon anemia . The rapid propagation of the virus has motivated the enterprise to sell some of its facilities , firing more than a thousand employees , with the aim of translating its installations further south to the [UNK] Region . Parasitic , viral and fungal infections are all disseminated when the fish are stressed and the centres are too close together , and a spokesman for Marine Harvest recognized that his company was using too many antibiotics in Chile and that fish pens were too close , contributing to the dissemination of the ISA virus .

1469," In a retrospective focusing on the entire Metroid series , GameTrailers remarked on the original game 's legacy and its effect on the video game industry . They noted that starting with Metroid , search and discovery is what continues to make the franchise popular . The website felt that the combination of detailed sprites , original map designs , and an intimidating musical score "" generated an unparalleled ambience and atmosphere that trapped the viewer in an almost claustrophobic state "" . They also noted that the Morph Ball , first introduced in Metroid , "" slammed an undeniable stamp of coolness on the whole experience and the franchise "" , and they enjoyed the end segment after defeating Mother Brain , claiming that the race to escape the planet Zebes was a "" twist few saw coming "" . The game brought "" explosive action "" to the Nintendo Entertainment System and a newfound respect for female protagonists .

1470," Staunton continued writing the chess column in Illustrated London News until his death in 1874 , greeting new developments with enthusiasm . In 1860 he published Chess Praxis , a supplement to his 1847 work The Chess Player 's Handbook . The new book devoted 168 pages to presenting many of Morphy 's games and praised the American 's play . Five years later Staunton published Great Schools of England ( 1865 ) , whose main subject was the history of major English public schools but which also presented some progressive ideas : learning can only take place successfully if the active interest of the student is engaged ; corporal punishment is to be avoided and [UNK] should be abolished . But most of his later life was occupied in writing about Shakespeare , including : a [UNK] reproduction of the 1600 Quarto of Much Ado about Nothing in 1864 and of the First Folio of Shakespeare in 1866 ; and papers on [UNK] Corruptions of Shakespeare 's Text , published from 1872 to his death . All these works were highly regarded at the time . When he died suddenly of heart disease , on 22 June 1874 , he was at his desk writing one of these papers . At the same time he was also working on his last chess book , Chess : Theory and Practice , which was published posthumously in 1876 . ",1
1471," Following the 1897 tour , many English counties were interested in securing King 's services . It was thought that he would not play as a professional , so alternative means of remuneration had to be found : one county reportedly offered to arrange a marriage with a widow who had an income of £ 7000 per year .

1472," By the early 1980s cracks had appeared in the wall built at the back of the Grosvenor Road End . The rear of the terracing was cordoned off , and the capacity of the ground reduced to under 13 @,@ 500 . The Grosvenor Road End was segregated and allocated to away supporters , and fencing was erected for the first time before the FA Cup match against Liverpool in February 1985 . All the fencing had been dismantled by the early 2000s . During the 1983 – 84 and 1984 – 85 seasons problems had arisen in handling big crowds , due to the ground having only two of four sides available for entry and exit , and the home supporters funnelling through the car park to the Shipton Street End . Extensive improvements were made in the summer of 1985 for approximately £ 100 @,@ 000 , and eight new turnstiles were installed at the Shipton Street End . Further , the dressing rooms were refurbished to incorporate new baths and showers , and a new referees ' changing room and physiotherapist 's treatment room were readied . Hospitality boxes were built into the Main Stand during 1986 – 87 , and video equipment was installed inside the ground . Crash barriers were strengthened , meaning ground safety requirements were met . These improvements meant that shortly before the Taylor Report was published , the ground 's capacity was 14 @,@ 109 , including 3 @,@ 059 seats .

1478," According to Jewish Law , one is obligated to grieve and rend one 's garment upon visiting the Western Wall and seeing the desolate site of the Temple . Bach ( 17th century ) instructs that "" when one sees the Gates of Mercy which are situated in the Western Wall , which is the wall King David built , he should recite : Her gates are sunk into the ground ; he hath destroyed and broken her bars : her king and her princes are among the nations : the law is no more ; her prophets also find no vision from the Lord "" . Some scholars write that rending one 's garments is not applicable nowadays as Jerusalem is under Jewish control . Others disagree , pointing to the fact that the Temple Mount is controlled by the Muslim waqf and that the mosques which sit upon the Temple site should increase feelings of distress . If one hasn 't seen the Wall for over 30 days , the prevailing custom is to rend one 's garments , but this can be avoided if one visits on the Sabbath or on festivals . According to [UNK] Epstein , a person who has not seen the Wall within the last 30 days should recite : "" Our Holy Temple , which was our glory , in which our forefathers praised You , was burned and all of our delights were destroyed "" .

1482," In the first superstring revolution in 1984 , many physicists turned to string theory as a unified theory of particle physics and quantum gravity . Unlike supergravity theory , string theory was able to accommodate the chirality of the standard model , and it provided a theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects . Another feature of string theory that many physicists were drawn to in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness . In ordinary particle theories , one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary Lagrangian . In string theory , the possibilities are much more constrained : by the 1990s , physicists had argued that there were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of the theory . ",1

1485," Armillaria gallica is a weaker pathogen than the related A. [UNK] or A. [UNK] , and is considered a secondary parasite — typically initiating infection only after the host 's defenses have been weakened by insect defoliation , drought , or infection by another fungus . Fungal infection can lead to root rot or butt rot . As the diseased trees die , the wood dries , increasing the chance of catching fire after being struck by lightning . The resulting forest fire may in turn kill the species that killed the trees . Plants that are under water stress caused by dry soils or waterlogging are more susceptible to infection by A. gallica . It has been shown to be one of several Armillaria species responsible for widespread mortality of oak trees in the Arkansas Ozarks . The fungus has also been shown to infect [UNK] in South Carolina , Northern highbush blueberry ( Vaccinium [UNK] ) in Italy and vineyards ( Vitis species ) of [UNK] [UNK] in northwestern Spain . The latter infestation "" may be related to the fact that the vineyards from which they were isolated were located on cleared forestry sites "" .

1486," The barn 's main posts are made of oak . Each is about 14 inches ( 36 cm ) square and sits on a block of Reigate sandstone , a common building material in medieval London . The posts were cut into shape using axes , adzes and saws , the marks from which can still be seen in some instances . The builders cut and fitted the timberwork together on the ground and scratched Roman numerals , called assembly marks , on the joints to indicate where pieces of timber were to be combined . Some of the pairs of main posts were made from the trunks of very large individual trees which were cut in two . They were all placed upside down , relative to the original direction of the tree . This was because the bottom of a tree is always wider than the top ; the greater width was needed to accommodate the joints with the beams that support the roof . Despite the care that the builders took to get the joints right , they may have made some mistakes along the way , as some of the timbers have holes for pegs and [UNK] that were never used . Alternatively , the timbers may have been reused from another construction . ",0

1604," The false catshark was first described by Portuguese ichthyologist Félix de Brito [UNK] in the Jornal do [UNK] [UNK] , [UNK] e [UNK] in 1868 . He based his account on a 2 @.@ 3 m ( 7 @.@ 5 ft ) long adult male caught off [UNK] , Portugal .

Thus , he assigned it to the new genus Pseudotriakis , from the Greek pseudo ( "" false "" ) . At the time , Triakis was classified with the catsharks , hence "" false catshark "" . The specific name microdon comes from the Greek mikros ( "" small "" ) and odontos ( "" tooth "" ) . Other common names for this species are dumb shark ( from its Japanese name [UNK] ) and keel @-@ dorsal shark . ",0
1605," Stage cylinders are cylinders which are stored by scuba divers along the return route containing decompression and emergency gas .

This salvation may not only extend to humans ; following Origen , there are passages where he seems to suggest ( albeit through the voice of Macrina ) that even the demons will have a place in Christ 's "" world of goodness "" . Gregory 's interpretations of 1 Corinthians 15 : 28 ( "" And when all things shall be subdued unto him ...

1615," Hindley made the first of two visits to assist the police search of Saddleworth Moor on 16 December 1986 . Four police cars left Cookham Wood at 4 : 30 am .

1616," The opposing sides began bringing in reinforcements to the Kupres Plateau on 5 March to strengthen positions held around individual settlements populated by different ethnic groups , communications between those positions , and roads leading away from the plateau to the north and south . Different parts of the town of Kupres were controlled by the opposing forces , while the adjacent territory surrounding the town was controlled by the Bosnian Croat TO .

1619," In the days leading to the "" Smoke Gets in Your Eyes "" premiere , the watchdog group Commercial Alert filed a complaint against producers to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States . Commentators from the group criticized distillery brand Jack Daniel 's for its decision to sponsor Mad Men , citing that it violates industry codes that prohibit alcohol marketing , as well "" depictions of irresponsible drinking , overt sexual activity or sexually lewd images "" . Robert Weissman , the director for Commercial Alert , stated that based on AMC 's website , "" it appears that the sponsorship arrangement will violate numerous provisions of the industry 's self @-@ regulatory marketing code .

1620," The Court of Appeal suggested that , in the light of Chng Suan Tze , the validity of an order for preventive detention made by the Minister under section 30 of the CLTPA is dependent on the objective satisfaction of the Minister . Moreover , in Re Wong Sin Yee ( 2007 ) , which also involved judicial review of an applicant 's detention under section 30 of the CLTPA , the High Court , following the decision in Chng Suan Tze , held that the absence of the need to establish a jurisdictional or precedent fact meant that the scope of judicial review as regards the exercise of the Minister 's discretion under section 30 was limited to the GCHQ grounds of judicial review . The Court thus applied an objective test to the subjectively worded powers in section 30 ; if it Court had applied a subjective test , it would have deferred to the subjective satisfaction of the Minister that the detention was in the interests of public safety , peace and good order .

1621," Their conclusions have been disputed ; soon after the initial description , other researchers published a paper where they asserted that the heart is really a concretion . As they noted , the anatomy given for the object is incorrect ( for example , the "" aorta "" narrows coming into the "" heart "" and lacks arteries coming from it ) , it partially engulfs one of the ribs and has an internal structure of concentric layers in some places , and another concretion is preserved behind the right leg .

1623," The sixth nocturne , dedicated to Eugène d [UNK] , is widely held to be one of the finest of the series . Cortot said , "" There are few pages in all music comparable to these . "" Morrison calls it "" among the most rich and eloquent of all Fauré 's piano works . "" The pianist and writer Nancy [UNK] calls it "" one of the most passionate and moving works in piano literature . "" Fauré wrote it after a six @-@ year break from composing for the piano .

The second theme , at first seemingly tranquil , has what the composer Charles Koechlin calls a persistent [UNK] , emphasised by the syncopated accompaniment . The initial theme returns , and is followed by a substantial development of a gentle , contemplative melody . A recapitulation of the principal theme takes the piece to its conclusion . Copland wrote that it was with this work that Fauré first fully emerged from the shadow of Chopin , and he said of the piece , "" The breath and dignity of the opening melody , the restless C sharp minor section which follows ( with the peculiar syncopated harmonies so often and so well used by Fauré ) , the graceful fluidity of the third idea : all these elements are brought to a stormy climax in the short development section ; then , after a pause , comes the return of the consoling first page .

1625," Later that year , Barbara Gordon appeared in Alan Moore 's Batman : The Killing Joke . In this graphic novel , the Joker shoots and paralyzes Barbara in an attempt to drive her father insane , thereby proving to Batman that anyone can be morally compromised . Although events in The Killing Joke exert a great impact on the character , the story has little to do with her .

1626," Nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch . This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing .

1627," In the early twentieth century , archaeological and historical research was conducted regarding a potential connection between Carantouan and the structures described on the hill . After surveying the area in spring and fall , archaeologist L.D. Shoemaker discovered evidence of Native American habitation , including shell heaps , corn and flint chips , along with various other implements . In 1918 , historian and archaeologist George P. Donehoo , after a survey of the site , determined that it was impossible for Spanish Hill to have been the site of the town described by Brûlé . He cited the sharp incline , which would have made ascension difficult , as well as the lack of water and archaeological evidence on the hill as evidence against it having been the location of Carantouan . Speculation that Spanish Hill was the site of the village was also countered by James Bennett Griffin , who found nothing of interest in the area following an archaeological survey in 1931 . However , historian Deb Twigg suggests that prior excavations conducted by early twentieth @-@ century archaeologist Warren Moorehead , as well as years of heavy farming activity in the area may have contributed to the lack of artifacts found during the Griffin expedition . As Twig wrote : “ Until more information is known , it seems imprudent to eliminate Spanish Hill as a possible site related to the nation of Carantouan , as some researchers have done . ” ",0

1633," If 3 John was written by John the Apostle , however , it is strange that Diotrephes would oppose him since the apostles were highly respected in the early church .

1636," In late 1977 , while in rehearsal for their next album , and just days before the band was set to enter the studio , Osbourne abruptly quit the band . Iommi called vocalist Dave Walker , a longtime friend of the band , who had previously been a member of Fleetwood Mac and Savoy Brown , and informed him that Osbourne had left the band .

On 8 January 1978 , Black Sabbath made their only live performance with Walker on vocals , playing an early version of the song "" Junior 's Eyes "" on the BBC Television program "" Look ! Hear !

1641," The physical impacts of ashfall can affect the operation of water treatment plants . Ash can block intake structures , cause severe abrasion damage to pump impellers and overload pump motors . Many water treatment plants have an initial coagulation / flocculation step that is automatically adjusted to turbidity ( the level of suspended solids , measured in [UNK] turbidity units ) in the incoming water . In most cases , changes in turbidity caused by suspended ash particles will be within the normal operating range of the plant and can be managed satisfactorily by adjusting the addition of coagulant . [UNK] will be more likely to cause problems for plants that are not designed for high levels of turbidity and which may omit coagulation / flocculation treatment . Ash can enter filtration systems such as open sand filters both by direct fallout and via intake waters . In most cases , increased maintenance will be required to manage the effects of an ashfall , but there will not be service interruptions . ",0

Similarly , a gene 's introns can be much larger than its exons . Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome . ",0

1692," Notre Dame had the worst start to their season in program history , opening 0 – 5 ( the previous record was 0 – 3 ) and headed into their game with USC at 1 – 6 . With significant problems at most positions , Notre Dame head coach Charlie Weis made several changes at quarterback : Starting the opener with sophomore Demetrius Jones , he chose to start heralded freshman Jimmy Clausen for games two through seven ; during which time Jones transferred from the program . After Clausen also showed trouble at the position , Weis elected to go with junior Evan Sharpley as the starter for the USC game ; Sharpley had backed up Brady Quinn the previous season . In response to controversy over the length of the grass in Notre Dame Stadium during the 2005 game , where USC kickoff returner Desmond Reed suffered torn right knee ligaments and nerve damage while trying to turn on the field , the Fighting Irish cut the grass significantly shorter . Notre Dame entered the game ranked last in total offense ( 190 @.@ 9 yards a game ) and rushing ( 32 @.@ 1 yards a game ) , and next to last in scoring ( 11 @.@ 4 points ) ; their offensive line had given up 34 sacks .

1693," For decades after its discovery , Megalosaurus was seen by researchers as the definitive or typical large carnivorous dinosaur . As a result , it began to function as a wastebasket taxon , and many large or small carnivorous dinosaurs from Europe and elsewhere were assigned to the genus . This slowly changed during the 20th century , when it became common to restrict the genus to fossils found in the middle Jurassic of England . Further restriction occurred in the late 20th and early 21st centuries , researchers such as Ronan Allain and Dan Chure suggesting that the Stonesfield Slate fossils perhaps belonged to several , possibly not directly related , species of theropod dinosaur . Subsequent research seemed to confirm this hypothesis , and the genus Megalosaurus and species M. bucklandii became generally regarded as limited to the taxon having produced the lectotype , the dentary of the lower jaw . Furthermore , several researchers failed to find any characteristics in that jaw that could be used to distinguish Megalosaurus from its relatives , which would mean the genus were a nomen dubium . However , a comprehensive study by Roger Benson and colleagues in 2008 , and several related analyses published in subsequent years , overturned the previous consensus by identifying several autapomorphies , or unique distinguishing characteristics , in the lower jaw that could be used to separate Megalosaurus from other megalosaurids .

1694," Quantitative methods are often used to ask questions about a population that is very large , making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible . A ' sample ' then forms a manageable subset of a population . In quantitative research , statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding the population as a whole . The process of selecting a sample is referred to as ' sampling ' . While it is usually best to sample randomly , concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling . Conversely , the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates [UNK] sampling , such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling . ",0
1695," After London seasons in 1906 – 07 and 1908 – 09 , the opera company did not perform in the West End again until 1919 , although it continued to tour in Great Britain . According to the theatre writer H. M. Walbrook , "" Through the years of the Great War they continued to be on tour through the country , drawing large and grateful audiences everywhere . They helped to sustain the spirits of the people during that stern period , and by so doing they helped to win the victory . "" Nevertheless , Carte later recalled , "" I went and watched the Company playing at a rather dreary theatre down in the suburbs of London . I thought the dresses looked dowdy .... I formed the view that new productions should be prepared , with scenery and dresses to the design of first class artists who understood the operas but who would produce a décor attractive to the new generation . "" In a 1922 memoir , Henry Lytton , having admired Richard D 'Oyly Carte 's keen eye for stagecraft , added , "" That ' eye ' for stagecraft ... has been inherited in a quite remarkable degree by his son , Mr. Rupert D 'Oyly Carte . He , too , has the gift of taking in the details of a scene at a glance , and knowing instinctively just what must be corrected "" . In 1911 , the company hired J. M. Gordon as stage manager , and Carte later promoted him to director . Gordon , under Carte 's supervision , preserved the company 's traditions in exacting detail for 28 years . ",1

1699," As a result of Carr Gomm 's letters to The Times , Merrick 's case attracted the notice of London 's high society . One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal . Although she probably never met him in person , she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick . She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver to go to his rooms and teach him the craft . Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however , bringing gifts of photographs and books . He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets . Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows . A young man , Charles Taylor , the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick 's rooms , spent time with him , sometimes playing the violin . Occasionally , he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital . When he was discovered , he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses , who feared that he might frighten the patients . ",1

1702," The second stage of construction in the 17th and 18th centuries , when the tower was under the charge of the Vatican librarian , involved Mgr . Filippo Luigi Gilii , a clergyman of St. Peter 's Basilica . Earlier in 1797 , Pius VI gave approval to placing a Latin inscription [UNK] Vaticana at the entrance to the upper part of the tower , which was implemented by Cardinal [UNK] with plans to enhance the instrumentation system in the tower 's observatory . The original observatory was then set up above the second level of the tower with the agreement of Pope Pius VI . Its instrumentation , apart from many normal devices ( such as meteorological and magnetic equipment , with a seismograph and a small transit and pendulum clock , ) was noted for the [UNK] Telescope . The instrumentation facilitated recording of occurrences of eclipse , appearance of comets , Satellites of Jupiter and Mercury ’ s transit . As an addition , under the patronage of Pope Pius X , four rotary observatory domes were also added at strategic locations on the 1 @,@ 300 feet ( 400 m ) long fortification walls , more than a thousand years old . Mgr . Gilii , highly respected as a polyglot with a knowledge of physics , biology , archeology and the Hebrew language , was in charge of the observatory from 1800 to 1821 . He carried out continuous meteorological observations ( twice a day at 6 AM and 2 PM ) conforming to the programme of the Mannheim Meteorological Society . While the observation records for seven years were published , the balance data in a manuscript form was preserved in the Vatican Library . Subsequent to Gilii 's death in 1821 , the observatory on the tower was discontinued and the instruments were moved to the observatory at the Roman College . Established in 1787 , it was considered more suitable for making observations than the Vatican . ",1

1709," Stephen 's early life was heavily influenced by his relationship with his uncle Henry I. Henry seized power in England following the death of his elder brother William Rufus .

Post @-@ war budget cuts saw Australia 's role downgraded to a training ship before she was placed in reserve in 1921 . The disarmament provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty required the destruction of Australia as part of the British Empire 's commitment , and she was scuttled off Sydney Heads in 1924 . ",0

As in the case with Guerriere , Java lay in shambles , an unmanageable wreck with a badly wounded crew . The British ship surrendered . Bainbridge determined that Java was far too damaged to retain as a prize and ordered her burned , but not before having her helm salvaged and installed on Constitution . Constitution returned to São Salvador on 1 January 1813 , where she met with Hornet and that ship 's two British prizes to disembark the prisoners of Java . Bainbridge ordered Constitution to sail for Boston on 5 January , being far away from a friendly port and needing extensive repairs , leaving Hornet behind to continue waiting for Bonne Citoyenne in the hopes that she would leave the harbor ( she did not ) . Constitution 's victory over Java , the third British warship in as many months to be captured by the United States , prompted the British Admiralty to order its frigates not to engage the heavier American frigates one @-@ on @-@ one ; only British ships of the line or squadrons were permitted to come close enough to these ships to attack .

After James was liberated in June 1583 , he assumed increasing control of his kingdom . Between 1584 and 1603 , he established effective royal government and relative peace among the lords , assisted by John Maitland of Thirlestane , who led the government until 1592 . In 1586 , James signed the Treaty of Berwick with England , which , with the execution of his mother in 1587 , helped clear the way for his succession to the childless Queen Elizabeth I of England .

1744," A charitable trust created from a gift must be exclusively charitable ; if there are any purposes which would not be charitable on their own , the trust fails . Trust instruments should ideally identify that the money is to be used for "" charitable purposes "" .

1758," Richard ( died 1184 ) was a medieval Benedictine monk and Archbishop of Canterbury . Employed by Thomas Becket immediately before Becket 's death , Richard arranged for Becket to be buried in Canterbury Cathedral and eventually succeeded Becket at Canterbury in a contentious election . Much of Richard 's time as archbishop was spent in a dispute with Roger de Pont L 'Evêque , the Archbishop of York over the primacy of England , and with St Augustine 's Abbey in Canterbury over the archbishop 's jurisdiction over the abbey . Richard had better relations with King Henry II of England than Becket had , and was employed by the king on diplomatic affairs . Richard also had the trust of the papacy , and served as a judge for the papacy . Several of his questions to Pope Alexander III were collected into the Decretals , a collection of ecclesiastical laws , and his patronage of canon lawyers did much to advance the study of canon law in England .

1759," Kojima commented that the outside environment was very difficult to create .

1763," In 2008 , General Motors was concerned about how the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) would test the Volt to determine its official fuel economy rating . The controversy centered on whether , by including a gasoline engine , the Volt should be classified as a hybrid rather than an electric car as claimed by General Motors . If tested with the same EPA tests used by other hybrids , the Volt 's EPA fuel economy rating would be around 48 mpg @-@ US ( 4 @.@ 9 L / 100 km ; 58 mpg @-@ imp ) due to the current EPA test for hybrids disallowing vehicles from boosting their mpg rating using stored battery power . General Motors stated that the Volt is an entirely new type of vehicle which the EPA 's current fuel economy tests were not suited to rate and that a new test should be devised for this emerging class of hybrid @-@ electrics . General Motors also advocated for a more simplified mpg calculation method to take into account the range of a plug @-@ in hybrid while running solely on electricity . Because the Volt can travel 40 miles ( 64 km ) on batteries alone , GM argued that most drivers with a daily commute of less than that distance would drive only in electric mode , so long as they recharged their vehicle at work or at home overnight .

1768," The opening of the Great Western Railway in 1841 removed much of the canal 's traffic , even though the canal company lowered tariffs . In 1852 the railway company took over the canal 's operation , levying high tolls at every toll point and reducing the amount spent on maintenance . Ice @-@ breaking was stopped in 1857 , and traders were further encouraged by preferential tolls to use the railway rather than the canal .

By 1868 the annual tonnage had fallen from 360 @,@ 610 in 1848 to 210 @,@ 567 . In the 1870s water abstraction from the canal near Fobney Lock followed the regulations introduced in the Reading Local Board Waterworks , Sewerage , Drainage and Improvements Act of 1870 , and contributed to the silting up of locks and stretches of the canal .

1772," Much of the right @-@ hand court of Kenilworth Castle is occupied by the castle garden . For most of Kenilworth 's history the role of the castle garden , used for entertainment , would have been very distinct from that of the surrounding chase , used primarily for hunting . From the 16th century onwards there were elaborate knot gardens in the base court . The gardens today are designed to reproduce as closely as possible the primarily historical record of their original appearance in 1575 , with a steep terrace along the south side of the gardens and steps leading down to eight square knot gardens . In Elizabethan gardens "" the plants were almost incidental "" , and instead the design focus was on sculptures , including four wooden obelisks painted to resemble porphyry and a marble fountain with a statue of two Greek mythological figures .

1776," The frequency and severity of recurrent outbreaks vary greatly between people . Some individuals ' outbreaks can be quite debilitating , with large , painful lesions persisting for several weeks , while others experience only minor itching or burning for a few days . Some evidence indicates genetics play a role in the frequency of cold sore outbreaks . An area of human chromosome 21 that includes six genes has been linked to frequent oral herpes outbreaks . An immunity to the virus is built over time . Most infected individuals experience fewer outbreaks and outbreak symptoms often become less severe . After several years , some people become perpetually asymptomatic and no longer experience outbreaks , though they may still be contagious to others . [UNK] individuals may experience longer , more frequent , and more severe episodes . Antiviral medication has been proven to shorten the frequency and duration of outbreaks . Outbreaks may occur at the original site of the infection or in proximity to nerve endings that reach out from the infected ganglia .

1779," The Mesa Verde region saw unusually cold and dry conditions during the beginning of the 13th century . This might have driven emigration to Mesa Verde from less hospitable locations .

Many smaller communities in the Four Corners region were also abandoned during this period . The Ancestral Puebloans had a long history of migration in the face of environmental instability , but the depopulation of Mesa Verde at the end of the 13th century was different in that the region was almost completely emptied , and no descendants returned to build permanent settlements . While drought , resource depletion , and overpopulation all contributed to instability during the last two centuries of Ancestral Puebloan occupation , their overdependence on maize crops is considered the "" fatal flaw "" of their subsistence strategy .

1859," Around this time , Dickinson 's behavior began to change . She did not leave the Homestead unless it was absolutely necessary and as early as 1867 , she began to talk to visitors from the other side of a door rather than speaking to them face to face . She acquired local notoriety ; she was rarely seen , and when she was , she was usually clothed in white .

Few of the locals who exchanged messages with Dickinson during her last fifteen years ever saw her in person .

1861," While the road building went on , Washington pressed Tanacharison for more Indian support . However , the Half King seemed to have lost confidence in the British cause , and he and his followers soon abandoned the British camp . This complete loss of Indian support prompted Washington to withdraw his work crews back to Fort Necessity . Not long afterward , a force of 700 French and Indians surrounded the fort , and Washington was soon compelled to surrender . The surrender document that Washington signed prevented his men from returning to the Ohio Country for one year , and included an admission that Jumonville had been "" assassinated "" . ( The document was written in French , which Washington could not read , and may have been poorly translated for him . ) Because the French claimed that Jumonville 's party had been on a diplomatic ( rather than military ) mission , the "" Jumonville affair "" became an international incident , and the military escalation that followed blossomed into the global Seven Years ' War . Although most Virginians were not particularly critical , there was rumbling about Washington 's actions in other quarters . One New Yorker wrote that Washington acted rashly and that he was "" too ambitious of acquiring all the honor "" , while London commentators dismissed the failure casually , citing a lack of colonial military experience . Governor Dinwiddie was publicly supportive of Washington , but criticized him privately , noting that some of the Virginia Regiment 's problems originated in a "" want of proper Command "" . Dinwiddie assigned command of a follow @-@ up expedition ( that never actually reached the Ohio Country ) to North Carolina militia colonel James Innes . In another step that may have been calculated to clip the young colonel 's wings , Dinwiddie reorganized the Virginia Regiment into separate companies , with no ranks above captain ; Washington resigned rather than accept a demotion .

1867," From government documents and propaganda , to public discourse and newspapers , many euphemisms have been used to describe the experiences of Japanese Americans who were forced from their homes and communities during World War II . Words like evacuation , relocation , and assembly centers imply that the United States Government was trying to rescue Japanese Americans from a disastrous environment on the West Coast and simply help them move to a new gathering place . These terms strategically mask the fact that thousands of Japanese Americans were denied their rights as US citizens , and forcibly ordered to live in poorly constructed barracks on sites that were surrounded by barbed wire and guard towers . Although the use of euphemisms was commonplace during World War II , and in many subsequent years , we realize that the continued use of these inaccurate terms is highly problematic . ",0
1868," Commentary on the beheadings varied widely .

There is no sense of the decapitation as being an act of vandalism , even less that it could have been motivated by malevolence ... [ T ] he piece has a definite authorising function "" . On the other hand , academic analysis has treated the act with much more gravity . In 2007 , for example , David Martin described the decapitation as "" an act which speaks not only to the continuance of white settler racism , but also to the power of mimesis to invigorate our modern memorials and monuments with a life of their own .

1938," Questions and criticisms were raised by air force experts and the Malaysian opposition about the state of Malaysia 's air force and radar capabilities . The failure of the Royal Malaysian Air Force to identify and respond to an unidentified aircraft ( later determined to be Flight 370 ) flying through Malaysian airspace was criticised by many . The Malaysian military became aware of the unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight 's disappearance . The failure to recognise and react to the unidentified aircraft was a security breach , and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time @-@ consuming and expensive search operation .

1939," While Burger King 's advertising programs were highly focused on its new product , most of the company 's sales gains were the result of aggressive price cutting by Burger King , specifically pricing its signature Whopper sandwich at 99 ¢ , according to analysts at Salomon Brothers . The price cutting promotions by Burger King , and number @-@ three chain Wendy 's , forced McDonald 's into its own price cutting program . According to Salomon , the burger segment 's price wars would have a detrimental effect on the profits of segment leaders , allowing other smaller chains such as Sonic Drive @-@ In , Jack in the Box and Carl 's Jr to position themselves as attractive alternatives to the big three chains .

1947," In the first published discussion of the Trossingen Plateosaurus finds , Fraas suggested that only miring in mud allowed the preservation of the single complete skeleton then known . Similarly , Jaekel interpreted the Halberstadt finds as animals that waded too deep into swamps , became mired and drowned . He interpreted partial remains as having been transported into the deposit by water , and strongly refuted a catastrophic accumulation . In contrast , von Huene interpreted the sediment as aeolian deposits , with the weakest animals , mostly subadults , succumbing to the harsh conditions in the desert and sinking into the mud of ephemeral water holes . He argued that the completeness of many finds indicated that transport did not happen , and saw partial individuals and isolated bones as results of weathering and trampling . Seemann developed a different scenario , in which Plateosaurus herds congregated on large water holes , and some herd members got pushed in . Light animals managed to get free , while heavy individuals got stuck and died . ",0
1948," The term "" non @-@ competitive antagonism "" ( sometimes called non @-@ surmountable antagonists ) can be used to describe two distinct phenomena : one in which the antagonist binds to the active site of the receptor , and one in which the antagonist binds to an allosteric site of the receptor . While the mechanism of antagonism is different in both of these phenomena , they are both called "" non @-@ competitive "" because the end @-@ results of each are functionally very similar . Unlike competitive antagonists , which affect the amount of agonist necessary to achieve a maximal response but do not affect the magnitude of that maximal response , non @-@ competitive antagonists reduce the magnitude of the maximum response that can be attained by any amount of agonist . This property earns them the name "" non @-@ competitive "" because their effects cannot be negated , no matter how much agonist is present . In functional assays of non @-@ competitive antagonists , depression of the maximal response of agonist dose @-@ response curves , and in some cases , rightward shifts , is produced . The rightward shift will occur as a result of a receptor reserve ( also known as spare receptors , see in pharmacodynamics ) and inhibition of the agonist response will only occur when this reserve is depleted .

1949," As freshmen struggled with the Athenian curriculum , he reverted to classification by academic discipline and offered companion texts in the field of the current work studied . In their dorms , the college students were known for their lack of respect for property , with three times the breakage in dorm assets than the rest of the university . Meiklejohn saw this as desirable and indicative of abetting nonconformity , and did not attempt to curb it .

Upon their exit two years later , students transferred to a number of Ivy League and prominent state universities . By this time , the college was known throughout the nation and Europe . ",1
1950," The series forced the NHL and the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association to reassess all aspects of how the game was played in North America . Journalist Herb Pinder described the NHL to that point in this way : "" The Europeans took our game and evolved it , while we stood still or even went backwards . The Russians had a style , and the Czechs ' style was different from that ... There was this hockey world evolving through international competition , and we 're back here , stuck , just playing ourselves . It was a business monopoly .

1957," Martin 's more formal musical expertise helped fill the gaps between the Beatles ' unrefined talent , and the sound which distinguished them from other groups , which would eventually make them successful . Most of the Beatles ' orchestral arrangements and instrumentation ( as well as frequent keyboard parts on the early records ) were written or performed by Martin , in collaboration with the less musically experienced band . It was Martin 's idea to put a string quartet on "" Yesterday "" , against McCartney 's initial reluctance . Martin played the song in the style of Bach to show McCartney the voicings that were available . Another example is the song "" Penny Lane "" , which featured a piccolo trumpet solo .

Through the rest of the 1960s , he continued to explore such possibilities of "" process composition "" in works for live performance , such as [UNK] ( 1967 ) , [UNK] , and Spiral ( both 1968 ) , culminating in the verbally described "" intuitive music "" compositions of Aus den sieben Tagen ( 1968 ) and Für [UNK] Zeiten ( 1968 – 70 ) ( Fritsch 1979 ; Kohl 1981 , 192 – 93 , 227 – 51 ; Kohl 1998b , 7 ; ( Toop 2005 , 191 – 92 ) ) . Some of his later works , such as [UNK] ( 1972 ) and the first three parts of [UNK] ( 1974 ) , also fall under this rubric ( Maconie 2005 , 254 , 366 – 68 ) . Several of these process compositions were featured in the all @-@ day programmes presented at Expo 70 , for which Stockhausen composed two more similar pieces , Pole for two players , and Expo for three ( Kohl 1981 , 192 – 93 ; Maconie 2005 , 323 – 24 ) . In other compositions , such as Stop for orchestra ( 1965 ) , Adieu for wind quintet ( 1966 ) , and the Dr. K [UNK] , which was written in 1968 – 69 in honour of Alfred Kalmus of Universal Edition , he presented his performers with more restricted improvisational possibilities ( Maconie 2005 , 262 , 267 – 68 , 319 – 20 ) .

2035," Perl 5 @.@ 000 was released on October 17 , 1994 . It was a nearly complete rewrite of the interpreter , and it added many new features to the language , including objects , references , lexical ( my ) variables , and modules .

Their book therefore offers bare facts and little in the way of interpretation . ",1
2037," In 2006 , Cisco Systems and Apple negotiated over allowing Apple rights to use Cisco 's [UNK] iPhone trademark , but the negotiations stalled when Cisco pushed for the two products to be [UNK] . Following the public unveiling of the Apple iPhone at the 2007 Macworld Expo , Cisco filed a lawsuit against Apple in January 2007 , alleging Apple 's iPhone name infringed on Cisco 's iPhone trademark . Cisco alleged that Apple created a front company subsequent to their negotiations to try to acquire the rights another way , while Apple countered that there would be no likelihood of confusion between the two products , because Apple 's iPhone product was the first cell phone with such a name , while Cisco 's iPhone was a VoIP phone . Bloomberg reported Cisco 's iPhone as a product marketed for less than $ 100 and part of the [UNK] home routers , enabling internet @-@ based calls through Skype and Yahoo !

2050," As with Kasumi 's , Ayane 's age has not been listed in the Western versions of the games to avoid backlash regarding characters portrayed as underage ; according to Itagaki , Ayane 's age in Ninja Gaiden would "" cause problems with the ESRB .

2051," Livia Kohn provides an example of how Laozi encouraged a change in approach , or return to "" nature "" , rather than action . Technology may bring about a false sense of progress . The answer provided by Laozi is not the rejection of technology , but instead seeking the calm state of wu wei , free from desires . This relates to many statements by Laozi encouraging rulers to keep their people in "" ignorance "" , or "" simple @-@ minded "" . Some scholars insist this explanation ignores the religious context , and others question it as an apologetic of the philosophical coherence of the text . It would not be unusual political advice if Laozi literally intended to tell rulers to keep their people ignorant .

2091," In early 1944 No. 73 Wing was selected to support the US Army 's Admiralty Islands campaign . The 1st Cavalry Division began to land on the islands on 29 February , and the wing moved to Momote Airstrip on Los Negros Island in March 1944 . No. 79 Squadron became operational there with 24 aircraft on the 29th of the month . From Momote , the squadron flew ground attack sorties in support of US troops until Japanese resistance ceased . No Japanese aircraft were encountered throughout this operation . By the end of April , No. 79 Squadron 's main role was to escort Allied shipping , though flying was hampered by a shortage of spare parts . The squadron 's commanding officer , Squadron Leader M.S. Bott , was killed in an accident on 16 April . Shipping escort patrols continued in May , but difficulties maintaining the Spitfires reduced the squadron to just two operational aircraft with another 12 awaiting repair . Due to a shortage of aircraft the squadron 's flying activities were limited to training sorties between August and October , and aircraft availability continued to be a problem until late November . On 9 November , two Spitfires unsuccessfully attempted to intercept three Japanese A6M fighters which had raided Hyane Harbour ; while the Japanese force had been tracked by Allied radar for 25 minutes prior to the attack , the Spitfires were scrambled only after the raiders had left the area . No. 79 Squadron subsequently maintained a three @-@ aircraft patrol over Los Negros during daylight hours until 22 November .

2092," As regards the second question , in R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority , ex parte Coughlan ( 1999 ) , the Court of Appeal of England and Wales identified three categories of legitimate expectations . Category ( b ) involves procedural legitimate expectations , and so are not discussed here because breaches of them are a form of procedural impropriety rather than illegality . Categories ( a ) and ( c ) relate to substantive legitimate expectations . Category ( a ) cases are those which lie "" in what may inelegantly be called the macro @-@ political field "" . The public authority "" is only required to bear in mind its previous policy or other representation , giving it the weight it thinks right , but no more , before deciding whether to change course "" , and the court may only review the authority 's decision on the ground of Wednesbury unreasonableness . On the other hand , category ( c ) cases are usually those "" where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people , giving the promise or representation the character of a contract "" . When assessing such a case , the court decides whether for a public authority to frustrate an expectation is so unfair that it amounts to an abuse of power . The court must weigh the requirements of fairness towards the individual against any overriding interests relied by the authorities to justify the change of policy . A slightly different approach has been adopted by Lord Justice John Laws . In R. v. Secretary of State for Education and Employment , ex parte Begbie ( 1999 ) , he suggested that the Coughlan categories are not "" hermetically sealed "" , and in Nadarajah v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ( 2005 ) , he expanded on this by taking a proportionality approach : ",0

2099," Gather Together was not as critically acclaimed as Angelou 's first autobiography , but received mostly positive reviews and was recognized as being better written than its predecessor . The book 's structure , consisting of a series of episodes tied together by theme and content , parallels the chaos of adolescence , which some critics feel makes it an unsatisfactory sequel to Caged Bird . Rita 's many physical movements throughout the book , which affects the book 's organization and quality , has caused at least one critic to call it a travel narrative . ",1
2100," Official scorers are only occasionally terminated , but there have been cases when a scorer was replaced after making decisions which displeased the home team .

2103," In November 1539 , Philip asked Bucer to produce a theological defence of bigamy , since he had decided to contract a bigamous marriage . Bucer reluctantly agreed , on condition the marriage be kept secret . Bucer consulted Luther and Melanchthon , and the three reformers presented Philip with a statement of advice ( [UNK] [UNK] ) ; later , Bucer produced his own arguments for and against bigamy . Although the document specified that bigamy could be sanctioned only under rare conditions , Philip took it as approval for his marriage to a lady @-@ in @-@ waiting of his sister . When rumours of the marriage spread , Luther told Philip to deny it , while Bucer advised him to hide his second wife and conceal the truth . Some scholars have noted a possible motivation for this notorious advice : the theologians believed they had advised Philip as a pastor would his parishioner , and that a lie was justified to guard the privacy of their confessional counsel . The scandal that followed the marriage caused Philip to lose political influence , and the Reformation within the Empire was severely compromised . ",0
2104," Prince Rakoto acceded to the throne on August 16 , 1861 upon the natural death of his mother , Queen Ranavalona I , assuming the throne name Radama II . His coronation ceremony was held the following year on September 23 , 1862 . Once upon the throne , he immediately initiated a rapid and dramatic reversal of many of his mother 's traditionalist policies . He reopened the country to foreign powers and concluded treaties of friendship with Britain and France . The Lambert Charter opened up business possibilities for French investors . Freedom of religion was declared , persecution of Christians ceased , missionaries returned to the island and their schools were reopened . Radama abolished the traditional trial by ordeal of tangena , in which the guilt or innocence of an accused person was determined based on the outcome of consuming the poison of the tangena nut , and inhabitants of Antananarivo were permitted to raise swine within the city walls , a practice previously forbidden by a fady ( taboo ) forbidding them from being kept near the royal talismans ( sampy ) . The sampy were dispersed to the sacred villages where they had originated under 16th @-@ century Merina king Ralambo and other early monarchs . Significantly , Radama freed numerous political prisoners captured under Ranavalona I during provincial wars of subjugation and offered repatriation of confiscated property . This pardon was reciprocated by many of the beneficiary ethnic groups around the island , and good will between the coasts and central administration at Antananarivo improved significantly . These changes , and the king himself , were unequivocally praised by Madagascar 's European partners : ",1
2105," All Things Must Pass received almost universal critical acclaim on release – as much for the music and lyrical content as for the fact that , of all the former Beatles , it was the work of supposed junior partner George Harrison . Beatles author Robert Rodriguez has written of critics ' attention being centred on "" a major talent unleashed , one who 'd been hidden in plain sight all those years "" behind Lennon and McCartney . "" That the Quiet Beatle was capable of such range , "" Rodriguez continues , "" from the joyful ' What Is Life ' to the meditative ' Isn 't It a Pity ' to the steamrolling ' Art of Dying ' to the playful ' I Dig Love ' – was revelatory .

2106," While Ten deals with dark subject matter , it has generally been seen as a high @-@ water mark of the early 1990s alternative rock sound , with Vedder 's unusually deep and strong ( and later much @-@ imitated ) voice alternating between solidity and vibrato against the unrestrained , guitar @-@ heavy , hard rock sound that drew influence from Led Zeppelin and other rock bands of the 1970s .

2109," Science Fiction was not selling well , and later that year Silberkleit merged it with Future Fiction , under the title Future Combined with Science Fiction . The last independent issue of Science Fiction was dated September 1941 , and the first merged issue was dated October 1941 . The final two issues of the combined magazine , dated April and June 1943 , were , confusingly , titled Science Fiction Stories ; this was an attempt to improve sales by reminding readers of Science Fiction , but before sales figures could be tallied to determine the impact of the title change , Silberkleit made the decision to cease publication .

2116," The mostly synthesized orchestral score of the season was composed by Christopher Lennertz and Jay Gruska .

For the fifth Test , he dropped down from opening the batting , which he had done throughout the series , to batting at number five , and responded with his first Test century . Batting with greater caution than usual , he scored 120 before accidentally standing on his own wicket . England won the match to take the series 3 – 2 , amid great public interest in England and Australia . MacLaren scored 240 runs at 26 @.@ 67 in the Test series , finishing fourth in the English averages .

2130," In writing Young Modern , Johns tried to make the music sound very simple , despite a complex musical structure . The lyrics were written after the music was created , sometimes as late as the day of recording . As Johns dreads writing lyrics , he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future . Johns is the band 's primary songwriter , and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes , they are key to the band 's overall sound . For that album , Hamilton co @-@ wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award winning "" Straight Lines "" . Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but "" still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements "" . He said that much of the band 's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing . Self @-@ producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label . ",1
2131," The Malay and English voices of the characters were dubbed by Malaysian voice actors . Child actors were employed for the younger roles ; however , Mat , Ana , Bo , and Tak were voiced by actors who were in their early twenties . Certain actors had the task of voicing multiple roles ; for example , the voice director was responsible for speaking the roles of Mrs Hew and Yah . Initially , voice talents were hired in Los Angeles to dub the English version , but they "" kept slipping into a Jamaican accent "" . Although this soundtrack was not used in the series , the producers felt it was too funny to waste and included it in The Making of Kampung Boy , which was broadcast a week before the start of the series .

2138," As proof of the successful revival of the British hard rock and metal scene , tours and gigs of old and new acts were sold out , both at home and in other European countries , where the movement had spread . Groups arising from the NWOBHM were no longer precluded from world tours and were often chosen as opening acts for major bands in arenas and stadiums . Iron Maiden supported Kiss in Europe in 1980 , embarking on their first world tour as headliners in 1981 , as well as opening for Judas Priest and UFO in the US . Def Leppard visited the US for the first time in 1980 for a three @-@ month trek supporting Pat Travers , Judas Priest , Ted Nugent , AC / DC and Sammy Hagar .

NWOBHM bands were already present on the roster of the famous Reading Festival in 1980 , and were quickly promoted to headliners for the 1981 and 1982 events . The 1980 edition was also remarkable for the violent protests against Def Leppard , whose declared interest in the American market was received badly by British fans . In addition to Reading , a new festival called Monsters of Rock was created in 1980 at Castle Donington , England , to showcase only hard rock and heavy metal acts . ",1

2159," During the 16th century the city became the chief cultural and religious centre of Transylvania ; in the 1820s and the first half of the 1830s , Kolozsvár was the most important centre for Hungarian theatre and opera , while at the beginning of the 20th century , still a Hungarian city , it became the chief alternative to the cinematography of Budapest . After its incorporation into the Kingdom of Romania at the end of World War I , the renamed Cluj saw a resurgence of its Romanian culture , most conspicuous in the completion of the monumental Orthodox cathedral in 1933 across from the ( newly nationalised ) Romanian National Theatre .

2161," In the time after myth , most gods were said to be either in the sky or invisibly present within the world . Temples were their main means of contact with humanity . Each day , it was believed , the gods moved from the divine realm to their temples , their homes in the human world . There they inhabited the cult images , the statues that depicted deities and allowed humans to interact with them in temple rituals . This movement between realms was sometimes described as a journey between the sky and the earth . As temples were the focal points of Egyptian cities , the god in a city 's main temple was the patron god for the city and the surrounding region . Deities ' spheres of influence on earth centered on the towns and regions they presided over . Many gods had more than one cult center , and their local ties changed over time . They could establish themselves in new cities , or their range of influence could contract . Therefore , a given deity 's main cult center in historical times is not necessarily his or her place of origin . The political influence of a city could affect the importance of its patron deity . When kings from Thebes took control of the country at start of the Middle Kingdom ( c . 2055 – 1650 BC ) , they elevated Thebes ' patron gods — first the war god Montu and then Amun — to national prominence .

2170," During the 1960s , various philosophers such as Donald Davidson , Hilary Putnam , and Fodor tried to resolve the puzzle of developing a way to preserve the explanatory efficacy of mental causation and so @-@ called "" folk psychology "" while adhering to a materialist vision of the world which did not violate the "" generality of physics "" .

The problem with logical behaviorism was that it failed to account for causation between mental states and such causation seems to be essential to psychological explanation , especially if one considers that behavior is not an effect of a single mental event / cause but is rather the effect of a chain of mental events / causes . The type @-@ identity theory , on the other hand , failed to explain the fact that radically different physical systems can find themselves in the identical mental state . Besides being deeply anthropocentric ( why should humans be the only thinking organisms in the universe ? ) , the identity @-@ type theory also failed to deal with accumulating evidence in the neurosciences that every single human brain is different from all the others .

2173," In the original series , divisions in ship assignments were denoted by shirt color ; for the movie , these color codes were moved to small patches on each person 's uniform . The Starfleet delta symbol , which previously indicated duty branches — command , science , medical , engineering , and so forth — was replaced with the command symbol for all branches , superimposed over a circle of color indicating area of service . The blue color of previous uniforms was discarded , for fear they might interfere with the blue screens used for optical effects . Three types of uniforms were fabricated : dress uniforms used for special occasions , Class A uniforms for regular duty , and Class B uniforms as an alternative . The Class A designs were double @-@ stitched in gabardine and featured gold braid designating rank . It was felt that the traditional four gold sleeve stripes for the captain 's rank was too blatantly militaristic . Povill had to send out a memo to Fletcher with the modified stripe rank system , as the designer continued to get the 20th and 23rd centuries confused . Fletcher designed the Class B uniform as similar to evolved T @-@ shirts , with shoulder boards used to indicate rank and service divisions .

The wall is painted in gold , adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon . The details of Bertin 's face are highly symmetrical . His eyes are heavily lidded , circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar , the winds of his hair , eyebrows and eyelids . His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right . This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality : he is a hard @-@ nosed businessman , and a patron of the arts . The reflection of a window can be seen in the rim of Bertin 's chair . It is barely discernible , but adds spatial depth . The Portrait of Pope Leo X ( c . 1519 ) by Raphael , a source for the Bertin portrait , also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope 's chair . ",1

Lloyd began shooting the episode in late October . Soon before the episode aired , Lloyd told reporters "" I was very excited for this role . My character is going through an experience he never expected to happen to him , and he 's adjusting to that . "" Lloyd also added he felt welcomed in as a part of the ensemble cast . In a conference call interview with journalists , John Noble explained that "" probably the best fun that I 've had [ on Fringe ] was doing the stuff with Chris Lloyd , because it was two crazy old guys just trying desperately to communicate with each other . We had a lot of laughs . There was a common thread of trying to find the music again , because Chris ' character had forgotten how to play the piano , so we go through this journey of bringing the music back to him , and [ it 's a ] thrill to Walter .

2184," Arthur 's costume was the easiest to create , as the color scheme mirrored his comic book counterpart , and was constructed to give a "" wetsuit look "" . The costume was also designed to be more form @-@ fitting , to complement Ritchson 's physique . Victor and Arthur 's tops were also hoodie variations . When designing Dinah Lance 's Black Canary costume , certain aspects of the comic book character were kept , while others changed entirely . For instance , the character retains her classic fishnet stockings , but the external , black mask the character wears is swapped for a painted mask . Cranstoun researched the various versions of Black Canary 's costume , looking through the 1940s and 50s , to try to come up with the right version for the show . Cranstoun explained that she primarily came across two versions . One version reminded the designer of a Playboy Bunny , with a "" curvy , corseted , strapless thing that was not at all action @-@ friendly "" . The other was more reminiscent of Lara Croft and Tank Girl , which is the route Cranstoun took . What Cranstoun created was a "" zipped , sleeveless body suit with a boot that was really flat and practical "" . The designer also kept the yellow accents the comic version had , as well as the long gloves . The filming crew did test shots with various masks for the character , including a leather mask reminiscent of the comic book character 's look , before going with the painted variation . ",0

2187," Congestion pricing or congestion charges is a system of [UNK] users of public goods that are subject to congestion through excess demand such as higher peak charges for use of bus services , electricity , metros , railways , telephones , and road pricing to reduce traffic congestion ; airlines and shipping companies may be charged higher fees for slots at airports and through canals at busy times . This pricing strategy regulates demand , making it possible to manage congestion without increasing supply . Market economics theory , which encompasses the congestion pricing concept , postulates that users will be forced to pay for the negative externalities they create , making them conscious of the costs they impose upon each other when consuming during the peak demand , and more aware of their impact on the environment .

2190," On July 28 , 1862 , gold was discovered along Grasshopper Creek , a tributary of the Beaverhead River , in a remote part of eastern Idaho Territory , leading to the establishment of the town of Bannack . Bannack was a gold rush boomtown that was the first territorial capital of Montana Territory for a brief period after the territory was established in 1864 . Less than a year after the Grasshopper Creek find , on May 26 , 1863 , gold was discovered along Alder Gulch , a tributary creek northeast of the Ruby River that lies between the Tobacco Root Mountains and the [UNK] Range and 70 miles ( 110 km ) east of Bannack . The Alder Gulch find became one of the largest placer mining gold fields in the western U.S. The mining settlements of Virginia City and Nevada City , Montana , which sprang up in Alder Gulch , boasted thousands of prospectors and fortune seekers by the end of 1863 . These new settlements generally lacked justice systems found in populated portions of the territory , such as in the territorial capital in Lewiston , Idaho . In 1863 , gold was the preferred form of currency in western frontier communities and had a value , fixed and guaranteed by the U.S. Government , of $ 20 @.@ 67 per ounce . Almost all economic transactions in western mining communities were accomplished with gold nuggets , flakes or dust as currency and not surprisingly , the more gold one had , the more wealth one possessed . During the early years of the territory , there was no secure way to transport wealth out of the region . The only means of transporting wealth out of the Alder Gulch gold fields was via horseback or slow moving wagons and stagecoaches on a limited number of trails and primitive roads leading south and west to Salt Lake City and San Francisco or east to Minnesota . Roads and trails leading to Alder Gulch included the Bozeman and Bridger Trails connecting to the Oregon Trail from the east , the Mullan Road from points west and from Fort Benton , Montana the head of navigation on the Missouri River and the Corinne Road from Corinne , Utah and points south . Additionally , there was a single track , 70 @-@ mile ( 110 km ) stage road that connected Alder Gulch with Bannack . Several commercial freight and two passenger stage companies — Peabody and Caldwell 's and A.J. Oliver 's — operated on this route . [UNK] had to stop at several different ranches during the trip to water and change horses , feed passengers and provide overnight lodging . One of these ranches , the Rattlesnake Ranch , was owned by Bill Bunton and Frank Parish , who were later hanged by the vigilantes as road agents and members of the Plummer gang . ",1
2191," Van Eyck had earlier portrayed Rolin in the c . 1435 Madonna of Chancellor Rolin , and the patron is recognizable from that work ; both portraits show similar lips , a large chin and somewhat pointed ears . In van Eyck 's portrait , Rolin is presented as perhaps pompous and arrogant ; here – ten years later – he appears more thoughtful and concerned with humility . Campbell notes wryly that van der Weyden may have been able to disguise the sitter 's ugliness and age , and that the unusual shape of his mouth may have been downplayed . He writes that while "" van Eyck impassively recorded , van der Weyden imposed a stylised and highly personal vision of the subject "" . Van Eyck 's depiction was most likely the more accurate ; van der Weyden embellished , mainly by lengthening the nose , enlarging the eyes and raising the eyebrows . ",1
2192," In response to McHugh 's speech , Chief Justice Gleeson said that the issue of whether or not Australia should have a bill of rights was a purely political one , and not a matter for the courts .

2193, The solar heavy @-@ element abundances described above are typically measured both using spectroscopy of the Sun 's photosphere and by measuring abundances in meteorites that have never been heated to melting temperatures .

2194," As with other early sauropodomorphs , it has been proposed that Massospondylus had cheeks . This theory was proposed because there are a few large holes for blood vessels on the surfaces of the jaw bones , unlike the numerous small holes present on the jaws of [UNK] reptiles . The cheeks would have prevented food from spilling out when Massospondylus ate . Crompton and [UNK] ( 1986 ) described skulls of Massospondylus as possessing pronounced [UNK] and suggested the presence of a horny beak on the tip of the lower jaw to make up the difference in length and account for tooth wear on the teeth at the tip of the snout . However , the difference in length may be a misinterpretation based on crushing in a top – bottom plane , and the possession of a beak is considered unlikely in recent studies . ",0

2198," Production in Sydney commenced the week beginning 1 October and lasted for 18 days . The main cast and Sean Pertwee were flown out along with a skeleton crew . Additional staff were drawn from those already working for Granada Australia , the Australian production arm of Granada Productions , as flying a complete British crew overseas would have been prohibitively expensive . Filming locations included Hyde Park , Kirribilli , Double Bay and the Northern Beaches . The scenes of Shawn 's barbecue were filmed in Palm Beach and the facade of a terraced house in Paddington was used for an establishing scene of Lucy 's apartment . The wedding scenes were set in the grounds of Strickland House , Vaucluse . Another scene was filmed on location outside the Sydney Opera House . While preparing for the scene , Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst were distracted by a group of British tourists yelling that Karen should leave David after David 's affair in Series 3 . The group remained quiet when the scene was being shot . Karen and David 's apartment was filmed at a building near Luna Park in [UNK] Point . A stunt team co @-@ ordinated the fight scene between Mark and David but could not convincingly choreograph a headbutt between Mark and David . The stunt co @-@ ordinator and Pertwee , who was already experienced in stunt fighting , agreed Pertwee would get a better reaction from Bathurst by almost headbutting his face for real , instead of "" hitting air "" . Initially startled by the move , Bathurst conceded that it was better for him to be surprised as he might have flinched if he had known what Pertwee was about to do . Hermione Norris found the scene upsetting insofar as it was unusual to see Robert Bathurst playing David in such an emotional state . ",0

In contrast , drugs that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes , such as St John 's wort , the antibiotic rifampicin , and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and phenytoin , accelerate elimination of many benzodiazepines and decrease their action .

2226," Because the relationships between the members of the family tree are uncertain , it is difficult to identify the features inherited from the last common ancestor of all molluscs . For example , it is uncertain whether the ancestral mollusc was [UNK] ( composed of repeating units ) — if it was , that would suggest an origin from an annelid @-@ like worm . Scientists disagree about this : [UNK] and colleagues concluded , in 2006 , the repetition of gills and of the foot 's retractor muscles were later developments , while in 2007 , [UNK] concluded the ancestral mollusc was [UNK] , and it had a foot used for creeping and a "" shell "" that was mineralized . In one particular branch of the family tree , the shell of [UNK] is thought to have evolved from the spicules ( small spines ) of aplacophorans ; but this is difficult to reconcile with the embryological origins of spicules .

2228," Bohemian waxwings are not brood parasitised by the common cuckoo or its relatives in Eurasia because the cuckoo 's young cannot survive on a largely fruit diet . In North America , the waxwing 's breeding range has little overlap with brown @-@ headed cowbird , another parasitic species . Nevertheless , eggs of other birds placed in a Bohemian waxwing 's nest are always rejected . This suggests that in the past , perhaps 3 million years ago , the ancestral waxwing was a host of a brood parasitic species , and retains the rejection behaviour acquired then . ",0
2229," Mina 's voice has distinctive timbre and great power . Her main themes are anguished love stories performed in high dramatic tones . The singer combined classic Italian pop with elements of blues , R & B and soul music during the late 1960s , especially when she worked in collaboration with the singer @-@ songwriter Lucio Battisti . Top Italian songwriters created material with large vocal ranges and unusual chord progressions to showcase her singing skills , particularly "" Brava "" by Bruno Canfora ( 1965 ) and the pseudo @-@ serial "" Se telefonando "" by Ennio Morricone ( 1966 ) . The latter song was covered by several performers abroad . Shirley Bassey carried Mina 's ballad "" Grande grande grande "" to charts in the U.S. , U.K. , and other English @-@ speaking countries in 1973 . Mina 's easy listening duet "" Parole parole "" was turned into a worldwide hit by [UNK] and Alain Delon in 1974 .

2234," Hurley was by now aware that his forward was using drugs , and attempted to keep his player 's habit a secret while he patiently worked to bring him back around . However , Friday began to regularly miss training and Hurley 's subtlety was misinterpreted as inaction by the other Reading players , who became unsettled and complained about Friday 's conduct . The club became increasingly minded to sell him , but although top @-@ flight clubs Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United were interested , they were reluctant to buy because of Friday 's temperament ; in Downs 's words , "" They weren 't sure they could handle him "" . By the end of October 1976 , Hurley had given up on attempting to rehabilitate his player , believing that the only solution was to sell him to a bigger team . "" The squad needs you but I owe it to the club because I can 't have you using drugs , "" Hurley told Friday . "" If I know you 're using drugs it won 't take them [ the major clubs ] long to find out . You have got to get your act together .

2235," His tragic efforts , however , were consistently ridiculed by contemporaries : when Cibber in the role of Richard III made love to Lady Anne , the Grub Street Journal wrote , "" he looks like a pickpocket , with his shrugs and grimaces , that has more a design on her purse than her heart "" . Cibber was on the stage in every year but two ( 1727 and 1731 ) between his debut in 1690 and his retirement in 1732 , playing more than 100 parts in all in nearly 3 @,@ 000 documented performances . After he had sold his interest in Drury Lane in 1733 and was a wealthy man in his sixties , he returned to the stage occasionally to play the classic fop parts of Restoration comedy for which audiences appreciated him . His Lord Foppington in Vanbrugh 's The Relapse , Sir Courtly Nice in John Crowne 's Sir Courtly Nice , and Sir [UNK] Flutter in George [UNK] 's Man of Mode were legendary . Critic John Hill in his 1775 work The actor , or , A treatise on the art of playing , described Cibber as "" the best Lord Foppington who ever appeared , was in real life ( with all due respect be it spoken by one who loves him ) something of the coxcomb "" . These were the kind of comic parts where Cibber 's affectation and mannerism were desirable . In 1738 – 39 , he played Shallow in Shakespeare 's Henry IV , Part 2 to critical acclaim , but his Richard III ( in his own version of the play ) was not well received . In the middle of the play , he whispered to fellow actor Benjamin Victor that he wanted to go home , perhaps realising he was too old for the part and its physical demands . Cibber also essayed tragic parts in plays by Shakespeare , Ben Jonson , John Dryden and others , but with less success . By the end of his acting career , audiences were being entranced by the innovatively naturalistic acting of the rising star David Garrick , who made his London debut in the title part in a production of Cibber 's adaptation of Richard III in 1741 . He returned to the stage for a final time in 1745 as Cardinal [UNK] in his play Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King John . ",1

2241," Waugh 's adherence to Catholic teaching on divorce caused him personal and sexual frustration while awaiting the possible annulment of his marriage . He had fallen in love with Teresa Jungman , a lively socialite whose Catholicism precluded any intimacy in their relationship since in the eyes of the Church Waugh remained married . Waugh 's conversion did not greatly affect the acerbic and sharply satirical tone of his fiction — his principal characters were frequently amoral and their activities sometimes shocking . Waugh claimed "" the right to write of man 's depravity in such a fashion as to make it unattractive "" . When Black Mischief was published in 1932 , the editor of the Catholic journal The Tablet , Ernest Oldmeadow , launched a prolonged attack on the book and its author , stating that the novel was "" a disgrace to anybody professing the Catholic name "" . Waugh , wrote Oldmeadow , "" was intent on elaborating a work outrageous not only to Catholic but to ordinary standards of modesty "" . Waugh made no public rebuttal of these charges ; an open letter to the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster was prepared , but on the advice of Waugh 's friends was not sent . ",0
2242," NIST found that the fireproofing on the Twin Towers ' steel infrastructures was blown off by the initial impact of the planes and that , had this not occurred , the towers likely would have remained standing . A 2007 study of the north tower 's collapse published by researchers of Purdue University determined that , since the plane 's impact had stripped off much of the structure 's thermal insulation , the heat from a typical office fire would have softened and weakened the exposed girders and columns enough to initiate the collapse regardless of the number of columns cut or damaged by the impact .

2243," Also during the 1970s , Bill Morris was studying giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California . He named them ? L. [UNK] in 1981 ( type specimen LACM [UNK] ) .

From what was known of the skull , he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus . He interpreted this species as water @-@ bound , due to features like its size , its tall and narrow tail ( interpreted as a swimming adaptation ) , and weak hip articulations , as well as a healed broken thigh bone that he thought would have been too much of a handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal . This species was later ( 2012 ) assigned to the new genus [UNK] . ",0

2249," MD 286 originally connected Chesapeake City with Bethel , a small community on the south side of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal just west of the state line . The state highway was paved from George Street , which is the original alignment of U.S. Route 213 ( US 213 , now MD 213 ) , east along Bethel Road and then north along what is now Bethel Cemetery Road in 1930 . MD 286 was disconnected from US 213 when the Chesapeake City Bridge was completed in 1948 and George Street was designated MD 537C . In 1954 , the United States Congress approved for the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal to be widened to 450 feet ( 140 m ) and the depth increased to 35 feet ( 11 m ) . The canal was expanded as it was not big enough to accommodate large ships and there were frequent collisions between ships and bridges . The community of Bethel was evacuated shortly before the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal was expanded in the 1960s . Most of the buildings in the community , including the church , were demolished . As a result of the canal expansion , MD 286 was removed from Bethel Cemetery Road and extended east to the state line in 1961 . Bethel Cemetery Road presently leads to a dead end at the canal where Bethel once existed . ",0

2252," For The Lion King 's first film trailer , Disney opted to feature a single scene , the entire opening sequence with the song "" Circle of Life "" .

Whedon acknowledged that the "" lyrical , heavenly quality "" of Benson 's voice led him to assign her the episode 's love song . Alyson Hannigan ( Willow ) was unwilling to sing much and her performance is "" apprehensive "" , according to Shuttleworth . He considers this an example of Tara 's quieter strength coming out in front of Willow 's showy demonstrations of powerful magic . Buffy studies scholar Rhonda Wilcox interprets Willow 's diminished role representing the show 's silence about Willow 's descent into addiction and darkness through the rest of the season .

2258," Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the Asian financial crisis of 1997 – 98 . From mid @-@ 1997 there were large capital outflows and against the US dollar . Due to poor bank lending practices , many Indonesian companies borrowed cheaper US dollar loans while their income is mainly in Indonesian rupiah .

2260," In 1992 , Kiarostami directed Life , and Nothing More ... , regarded by critics as the second film of the Koker trilogy . The film follows a father and his young son as they drive from Tehran to Koker in search of two young boys who they fear might have perished in the 1990 earthquake . As the father and son travel through the devastated landscape , they meet earthquake survivors forced to carry on with their lives amid disaster . That year Kiarostami won a Prix Roberto Rossellini , the first professional film award of his career , for his direction of the film . The last film of the so @-@ called Koker trilogy was Through the Olive Trees ( 1994 ) , which expands a peripheral scene from Life and Nothing More into the central drama . Critics such as Adrian Martin have called the style of filmmaking in the Koker trilogy as "" [UNK] "" , linking the zig @-@ zagging patterns in the landscape and the geometry of forces of life and the world .

This symbolically links to the post @-@ earthquake reconstruction in Through the Olive Trees in 1994 . In 1995 , Miramax Films released Through the Olive Trees in the US theaters . ",1

2300," This poor reasoning includes appeals to ancient astrologers such as Kepler despite any relevance of topic or specific reasoning , and vague claims . The claim that evidence for astrology is that people born at roughly "" the same place have a life pattern that is very similar "" is vague , but also ignores that time is reference frame dependent and gives no definition of "" same place "" despite the planet moving in the reference frame of the solar system . Other comments by astrologers are based on severely [UNK] interpretations of basic physics , such as a claim by one astrologer that the solar system looks like an atom . Further , James noted that response to criticism also relies on faulty logic , an example of which was a response to twin studies with the statement that coincidences in twins are due to astrology , but any differences are due to "" heredity and environment "" , while for other astrologers the issues are too difficult and they just want to get back to their astrology .

Moreover , Iorio stated that the modern ephemerides of the Solar System outer planets has provided even tighter constraints : no celestial body with a mass of 15 times that of Earth can exist closer than 1100 – 1300 AU . However , work by another group of astronomers using a more comprehensive model of the Solar System found that Iorio 's conclusion was only partially correct . Their analysis of Cassini data on Saturn 's orbital residuals found that observations were inconsistent with a planetary body with the orbit and mass similar to those of Batygin and Brown 's Planet Nine having a true anomaly of − 130 ° to − 110 ° or − 65 ° to 85 ° .

2424," Research in the late 19th century lead to what Rishel describes as "" one of the [UNK] conundrums in the study of Early Netherlandish art "" , as efforts were made to establish authorship and date the panels in terms of precedence . The panels are neither signed nor dated , and have proved especially difficult to attribute . Establishing an approximate date of completion is usually one of the most important factor in attributing an old master painting . Dendrochronological analysis of the Philadelphia panel dated its growth rings to between 1225 and 1307 . It was established that the board was cut from the same tree as the wood of two known panels by van Eyck , the Portrait of Baudouin de Lannoy ( c . 1435 ) and Portrait of Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini ( 1438 ) . These have tree @-@ rings that developed between 1205 and 1383 , and 1206 and 1382 , respectively . Examination of the sapwood suggests a felling date of around 1392 . Assuming a typical 10 years of seasoning before use , any of the paintings could have begun from around 1408 onwards . The Turin version is painted on two glued boards , vertical to the image . The rings from board I are dated between 1273 and 1359 , those of board II from 1282 to 1365 . ",0

2480," In The Simpsons and Philosophy : The D 'oh ! of Homer , the authors cite "" escaping from a cult commune in ' The Joy of Sect ' "" as evidence of "" Aristotle 's virtuous personality traits in Marge . "" As the title suggests , the book The Psychology of the Simpsons : D 'oh ! examines "" The Joy of Sect "" from a psychological point of view . It discusses the psychology of decision @-@ making in the episode , noting , "" Homer is becoming a full @-@ blown member of the Movementarians not by a rational choice , ... but through the process of escalating behavioral commitments . "" The Psychology of the Simpsons explains the key recruitment techniques used by the Movementarians , including the charismatic leader , established authority based on a religious entity or alien being ( in this case "" Blisstonia "" ) , and the method of taking away free choice through acceptance of the Leader 's greatness . The book also analyzes the techniques used during the six @-@ hour Movementarian recruitment film . In that scene , those who rise to leave are reminded that they are allowed to leave whenever they wish . They are , however , questioned in front of the group as to specifically why they wish to leave , and these individuals end up staying to finish watching the film . The book describes this technique as "" subtle pressure "" , in contrast to the "" razor wire , landmines , angry dogs , crocodiles and evil mystery bubble Marge confronts to escape , while being reminded again that she is certainly free to leave "" . The Psychology of the Simpsons writes that "" the Leader "" is seen as an authority figure , because "" he has knowledge or abilities that others do not , but want "" . Instead of traditional mathematics textbooks , the children on the compound learn from Arithmetic the Leader 's Way and Science for Leader Lovers . ",1

2483," The Foreigner song "" Hot Blooded "" plays over Apu 's bachelor binge , and he dances in a manner similar to Riverdance . Additionally , an Indian version of The Carpenters ' song "" ( They Long to Be ) Close to You "" is sung at the wedding ; an Indian vocal group was hired to sing , while Alf Clausen wrote the instrumental part . The scene where Moe walks on and off the stage without breaking his stride was loosely based on a moment that occurred during a stand up show of comedian Redd Foxx . During a show in Las Vegas , Foxx came on stage to the Sanford and Son theme song , only to find that there were very few people in the audience . Foxx reacted angrily refusing to do a show with such a small audience and walked off . The house orchestra , puzzled by Foxx 's leave simply played him off with the Sanford and Son theme song again . This incident was also referenced in the later episode "" Trash of the Titans "" , when Ray Patterson is reinstated , although the reference is more similar to the real event then . ",0
2484," Stress in English is phonemic , and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress . For instance , the word contract is stressed on the first syllable ( / [UNK] / [UNK] @-@ [UNK] ) when used as a noun , but on the last syllable ( / [UNK] / [UNK] @-@ [UNK] ) for most meanings ( for example , "" reduce in size "" ) when used as a verb . Here stress is connected to vowel reduction : in the noun "" contract "" the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel / ɒ / , but in the verb "" contract "" the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to / ə / . Stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases , so that a compound word receives a single stress unit , but the corresponding phrase has two : e.g. to [UNK] [UNK] versus a [UNK] , and a [UNK] versus a [UNK] [UNK] .

2487," The white @-@ eyed river martin may be migratory , and if the breeding habitat resembles that of the African river martin , it is likely to be the forested valleys of large rivers ; these can provide sandbars and islands for nesting , and woodland over which the birds can catch insect prey . The breeding grounds and habitat are unknown , although river valleys in northern Thailand or southwestern China are possibilities . A claimed depiction of this species in a Chinese scroll painting initially appeared to support the possibility of the martin breeding in China . The bird in the painting had a similarly shaped head and bill , a white eye and a long tail , although it lacked the white rump , did not show the correct bill colour , and elongated the outer , rather than central , tail feathers . Painted before 1970 , it pre @-@ dated the publication of pictures of the Thai bird , so it must have been painted from life . It is now thought more likely that the scroll shows Oriental pratincoles ( [UNK] [UNK] ) . Cambodia and Burma have also been suggested as possible refuges for the martin , but there has also been speculation on whether it is migratory at all . ",0

2489, This model was ideal for close combat and was efficient in trench warfare due to its 20 inch cylinder bore barrel . Buckshot ammunition was issued with the trench grade during the war . Each round of this ammunition contained nine 00 ( .33 @-@ caliber ) buckshot pellets . This gave considerable firepower to the individual soldier by each round that was fired . This shorter barrel and large amount of firepower is what made this grade ideal for trench warfare . The Model 1897 was used by American troops for other purposes in World War I other than a force multiplier . American soldiers who were skilled at trap shooting were armed with these guns and stationed where they could fire at enemy hand grenades in midair . This would deflect the grenades from falling into the American trenches and therefore protect American soldiers . ,1

2501," Francis Galton ( 1822 – 1911 ) was a pioneer in investigating both eminent human achievement and mental testing . In his book Hereditary Genius , writing before the development of IQ testing , he proposed that hereditary influences on eminent achievement are strong , and that eminence is rare in the general population . Lewis Terman chose "" ' near ' genius or genius "" as the classification label for the highest classification on his 1916 version of the Stanford – Binet test . By 1926 , Terman began publishing about a longitudinal study of California schoolchildren who were referred for IQ testing by their schoolteachers , called Genetic Studies of Genius , which he conducted for the rest of his life . Catherine M. Cox , a colleague of Terman 's , wrote a whole book , The Early Mental Traits of 300 Geniuses , published as volume 2 of The Genetic Studies of Genius book series , in which she analyzed biographical data about historic geniuses . Although her estimates of childhood IQ scores of historical figures who never took IQ tests have been criticized on methodological grounds , Cox 's study was thorough in finding out what else matters besides IQ in becoming a genius . By the 1937 second revision of the Stanford – Binet test , Terman no longer used the term "" genius "" as an IQ classification , nor has any subsequent IQ test . In 1939 , Wechsler specifically commented that "" we are rather hesitant about calling a person a genius on the basis of a single intelligence test score . "" ",1

2506," The writers originally conceived several premature joke game endings if the player performed certain actions , but these required too much development effort for little payback and were scrapped . One of these joke endings was triggered by shooting a portal onto the moon 's surface , after which the player 's character would die from asphyxiation over a closing song , but the idea of creating a portal on the moon was incorporated into the game 's final ending . The writers planned that Chell would say a single word during the ending , but this was not considered funny enough .

2509," Nineteen moons are known to be massive enough to have relaxed into a rounded shape under their own gravity , and seven of them are more massive than either Eris or Pluto .

2523," R.C. MacLeod considered the above ' fairy lover ' tradition to be connected to another about a lullaby . This tradition originated with Neil MacLeod , who was the clan bard in the last half of the 19th century ; he obtained the tradition from several old women in ' MacLeod country ' . This lullaby @-@ tradition related how on an autumn night , a beautiful fairy visited Dunvegan Castle . She passed through several closed doors and entered the nursery where the infant heir to the chief was lying in his cradle . The nursemaid , who was within the room as well , was rendered powerless by a spell and could only watch as the fairy took the infant on her knee and sang him a lullaby . This song was so remarkable that it was imprinted upon the nursemaid 's memory , and later she lulled the baby asleep by singing the same song . R.C. MacLeod stated that , over time it was believed that any infant of the chiefly family , to whom this lullaby was sung , would be protected by the power of the fairies . For a while , no nurse was employed by the family who could not sing this song . A period of 200 years then passed before any chief had been born within the castle , and the custom of singing the fairy 's lullaby ceased to be followed — but according to R.C. MacLeod , not completely forgotten . R.C. MacLeod claimed that a nursemaid sang this lullaby at the castle in the year 1847 , for his infant elder brother , who would later become Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod ( 1847 – 1935 ) , 27th chief of the clan . An English translation of the lullaby is shown to the right . ",1

2526," Parsons and Parsons have shown that juvenile and sub @-@ adult specimens of Deinonychus display some morphological differences with the adults . For instance , the arms of the younger specimens were proportionally longer than those of the adults , a possible indication of difference in behavior between young and adults . Another example of this could be the function of the pedal claws . Parsons and Parsons have suggested that the claw curvature ( which Ostrom [ 1976 ] had already shown was different between specimens ) maybe was greater for juvenile Deinonychus , as this could help it climb in trees , and that the claws became straighter as the animal became older and started to live solely on the ground . This was based on the hypothesis that some small dromaeosaurids used their pedal claws for climbing . In a 2015 paper , they reported after further analysis of immature fossils that the open and mobile nature of the shoulder joint might have meant that young Deinonychus were capable of some form of flight .

2551," Reviewing Patterson 's and Thewissen 's contributions in 1994 , Ross MacPhee found little support for the classification of Plesiorycteropus as a [UNK] in their data . MacPhee used a cladistic analysis of eutherians to ascertain the relationships of the genus , but found that while different analytic variants supported different affinities — with aardvarks , hyraxes , ungulates ( [UNK] mammals ) , and even [UNK] ( shrews , moles , hedgehogs , and allies ) — there was no compelling evidence linking it to any other eutherian group . Therefore , he erected a separate order for Plesiorycteropus , named [UNK] , arguing that it would be unacceptable to leave a Recent eutherian unassigned to any order and that discovery of more material , or further analysis , was unlikely to demonstrate close affinities of Plesiorycteropus with any other order . He considered it possible but unlikely that a few fossil taxa , such as [UNK] and [UNK] from the Paleogene of France , would eventually be found to be [UNK] . Various analyses published by Robert Asher and colleagues in 2003 , 2005 , and 2007 , based on morphology combined with DNA sequence data in some analyses , produced different estimates of the relationships of Plesiorycteropus , some placing it within Afrotheria close to aardvarks or [UNK] , but others supporting a relationship with the hedgehog [UNK] . A 2004 morphological study by Inés Horovitz , focusing on extinct South American ungulates ( such as [UNK] and [UNK] ) , placed Plesiorycteropus among tubulidentates and closer to the extinct aardvark relative [UNK] than to Orycteropus . A 2013 study by Michael Buckley examined preserved collagen sequences in Plesiorycteropus bones .

Daley 's disapproval of Gehry 's subsequent design of an 800 – 900 @-@ foot ( 240 – 270 m ) bridge caused Gehry to come up with ten more designs . The first of these plans was for a Z @-@ shaped bridge that would have run northwest – southeast with western ramps in Millennium Park , leading south , and eastern ramps in the empty north section of Daley Bicentennial Plaza , leading north . It would have required elevators to conform to the Americans with Disabilities Act . This plan was abandoned because it would have segregated the handicapped .

2568," Although very distinctive in appearance , the fly agaric has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom species in the Americas , such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita [UNK] — a Mexican species similar to A. caesarea of Europe . Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that [UNK] ( Spanish for ' yellow ' ) is a common name for the A. caesarea @-@ like species in Mexico . Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric . Furthermore , the stem , gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow , not white . The volva is a distinct white bag , not broken into scales . In Australia , the introduced fly agaric may be confused with the native vermilion grisette ( Amanita [UNK] ) , which grows in association with eucalypts . The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A. muscaria and bears no ring . ",0

2572," Once the machine was completed , the filming , using a single Steadicam , took two days to complete on February 11 and 12 , with an estimated 60 takes for the machine to properly function . The first day of filming included 47 takes , none of which successfully completed the entire machine and necessitated a second day of filming . Many of the takes ended only 30 seconds into the process , at the start of the song 's chorus , where a tire would fail to roll properly into the next section of the machine . Syyn Labs had a group of 30 people to help reset the machine after each failed take , a process that took upwards of an hour depending on how far the machine ran . There were no significant injuries during filming ; Tim Nordwind once was hit hard with paint at the end , while the Steadicam operator nearly got hit with one of the barrels at the end of the mechanism in the shot used for the final video . His reaction may be seen in the released version of the video . ",0

2582," An example progress curve for an enzyme assay is shown above . The enzyme produces product at an initial rate that is approximately linear for a short period after the start of the reaction . As the reaction proceeds and substrate is consumed , the rate continuously slows ( so long as substrate is not still at saturating levels ) . To measure the initial ( and maximal ) rate , enzyme assays are typically carried out while the reaction has progressed only a few percent towards total completion . The length of the initial rate period depends on the assay conditions and can range from milliseconds to hours . However , equipment for rapidly mixing liquids allows fast kinetic measurements on initial rates of less than one second .

2620," The Canadian National Vimy Memorial site has considerable sociocultural significance for Canada . The idea that Canada 's national identity and nationhood were born out of the Battle of Vimy Ridge is an opinion that is widely published in military and general histories of Canada . Historian Denise Thomson suggests that the construction of the Vimy memorial represents the culmination of an increasingly assertive nationalism that developed in Canada during the interwar period . Hucker suggests that the memorial transcends the Battle of Vimy Ridge and now serves as an enduring image of the whole First World War , while expressing the enormous impact of war in general . Hucker also suggest that the 2005 restoration project serves as evidence of a new generation 's determination to remember Canada 's contribution and sacrifice during the First World War . The Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada recognized the importance of the site by recommending its designation as a National Historic Site of Canada ; it was so designated , one of only two outside of Canada , in 1997 . The other is the Beaumont @-@ Hamel Newfoundland Memorial , also in France .

With the Reformation , painted depictions of saints and miracles fell out of favour in Protestant areas . In Catholic thought , charitable works of mercy such as giving alms to the blind and poor were good works which , together with faith , helped the salvation of the doer ; but the Protestant doctrine of sola fide rejected the efficacy of works in salvation , which depended on faith alone ( and the complication of God 's predestined will for each individual ) . The status of charity for the poor and infirm diminished , and beggars saw their circumstances deteriorate . In popular literature of the time , the blind were depicted as rogues or targets of pranks . The parable of the blind leading the blind also appears as one of the illustrated proverbs in Bruegel 's Netherlandish Proverbs ( 1559 ) . ",0

2818," Remains of Plesiorycteropus have been misidentified as rodents and primates . Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major described [UNK] [UNK] in 1908 as a "" giant subfossil rat "" on the basis of two innominate bones ( pelvic bones ) . The generic name was replaced by Majoria in 1915 , because [UNK] was preoccupied by the name of a nematode worm . However , according to MacPhee , [UNK] of Majoria are identical to those assigned to Plesiorycteropus . Guillaume Grandidier assigned a well @-@ preserved femur ( upper leg bone ) to a gigantic relative of the living [UNK] ( Hypogeomys antimena ) , a large rodent , which he described as Hypogeomys boulei . Lamberton identified this femur as Plesiorycteropus and MacPhee concurred . Remains of both Majoria [UNK] and Hypogeomys boulei fall at the upper end of the size range of the genus , indicating that they are referable to P. madagascariensis . Another Plesiorycteropus innominate was mistakenly assigned to Daubentonia robusta , the extinct giant aye @-@ aye , and other material has been misidentified as of a dwarf lemur ( Cheirogaleus ) .

2820," This still left the problem of getting government support for uranium research . Another friend of Szilárd 's , the Austrian economist Gustav [UNK] , suggested approaching Alexander Sachs , who had access to President Franklin D. Roosevelt . Sachs told Szilárd that he had already spoken to the President about uranium , but that Fermi and Pegram had reported that the prospects for building an atomic bomb were remote . He told Szilárd that he would deliver the letter , but suggested that it come from someone more prestigious . For Szilárd , Einstein was again the obvious choice . Sachs and Szilárd drafted a letter riddled with spelling errors and mailed it to Einstein . ",0
2821," It took sixteen years from the initial developing stage begun in 1994 , until the Greenville Bridge opened to traffic on August 4 , 2010 . The entire cost of the bridge totaled $ 336 million . In 2011 , the massive process of removing the old bridge by cutting into small sections to be recycled was begun , and is expected to be completed by September 2012 .

2822," It has also been suggested that the 1968 releases of 2001 : A Space Odyssey and Planet of the Apes established an unattainable standard for other films of the science @-@ fiction genre . Erickson argues that the film is inferior to 2001 for its depiction of a realistic "" working future "" in which humans remain attached to commercialism . Comparing the visual style of Doppelgänger to that used by film director Stanley Kubrick , he notes similarities in the use of close @-@ up eye shots and various "" psychedelic "" images , regretting that "" all these borrowings are fluff without any deeper meaning .

2826," Isolation manifolded twin sets or manifolded doubles with two regulators , consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves connected by a manifold , with a valve in the manifold that can be closed to isolate the two pillar valves . In the event of a problem with one cylinder the diver may close the isolator valve to preserve gas in the cylinder which has not failed . The advantages of this configuration include : a larger gas supply than from a single cylinder ; automatic balancing of the gas supply between the two cylinders ; thus , no requirement to constantly change regulators underwater during the dive ; and in most failure situations , the diver may close a valve to a failed regulator or isolate a cylinder and may retain access to all the remaining gas in both the tanks . The disadvantages are that the manifold is another potential point of failure , and there is a danger of losing all gas from both cylinders if the isolation valve cannot be closed when a problem occurs . This configuration of cylinders is often used in technical diving . ",0
2827," In 1998 , the historic status of the barges was a concern for the Port Authority of Bridgeport Harbor , as the sunken ships interfered with a billion @-@ dollar redevelopment project . Over the years , the barges had deteriorated so that a salvage operation would likely result in them breaking apart . No action had been taken by 2003 , but a report noted that prior to any activity of the Berkshire No. 7 , the Federal Transit Administration and / or the City of Bridgeport should document the barge with photos and a technical description . Specifics regarding the documentation based on the activity would be archived at the State Historic Preservation Office and the Mystic Seaport Museum . ",0

2829," All Saints ' originally consisted of a nave and chancel , to which a sanctuary was added in the first building phase . The church was extended on three occasions between the 10th and 14th centuries – a period of population growth – to include an aisled nave , a western tower and a northern chapel ; its windows featured stained glass . The church was abandoned in the 15th century , presumably because the parish could no longer support two churches . It was demolished , and virtually all of its masonry removed , some of which may have been used in improvements to the church of St Nicholas . The settlement of Shuart remained as an area of local administration into the 17th century , but it is now regarded as a deserted medieval village . There were no visible remains of All Saints ' Church by 1723 , although land there remained as glebe belonging to the parish of St Nicholas . The site of All Saints ' Church was excavated by archaeologists between 1978 and 1979 . The main structure had been robbed of its materials leaving only the foundations , from which the archaeologists were able to interpret the history of the building 's construction and its form . Among the foundations were discovered numerous stone carvings , floor tiles , remnants of stained glass , and several disturbed graves . ",0

2832," The 52nd remained in India until 1865 , when they returned to England . Over the next sixteen years they received postings in Ireland , England , Malta and Gibraltar . In 1881 , due to the Childers Reforms , they were merged with the 43rd ( Monmouthshire ) Regiment of Foot , a regiment they had fought alongside as part of the Light Division during many campaigns . The newly combined unit was named the "" Oxfordshire Light Infantry "" – the 52nd becoming the 2nd Battalion – and in 1908 the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry .

2836," The city of Preslav was made the capital of Bulgaria early in Simeon 's reign , partly because of the former capital Pliska 's association with pre @-@ Christian paganism . Simeon turned Preslav into a cultural centre , a true rival to Constantinople . Some of the most eminent scholars of Bulgaria 's Golden Age worked at the Preslav Literary School . Intended more as a royal residence and a showcase of cultural power than a fortress , the city boasted impressive architecture , including a large number of characteristic palaces and dozens of churches .

2840," A further complication is that a certain proportion of the Allied manpower was needed to man the fleet , which amounted to at least 110 triremes , and thus approximately 22 @,@ 000 men .

2842," An important generalization of the derivative concerns complex functions of complex variables , such as functions from ( a domain in ) the complex numbers C to C. The notion of the derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition . If C is identified with R2 by writing a complex number z as x + i y , then a differentiable function from C to C is certainly differentiable as a function from R2 to R2 ( in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist ) , but the converse is not true in general : the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is complex linear and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the Cauchy – Riemann equations – see holomorphic functions .

A short stub called Church Siding would run northwest into Wotton Underwood itself , terminating near the parish church , and a 1 mile 57 chains ( 2 @.@ 8 km ) siding would run north to a coal siding near Kingswood . The branch to Kingswood was routed to pass a pond , to allow the horses working the line to drink . ",0
2877," The original Macintosh version of Myst was constructed in HyperCard . Each Age was a unique HyperCard stack . Navigation was handled by the internal button system and [UNK] scripts , with image and QuickTime movie display passed off to various plugins ; essentially , Myst functions as a series of separate multimedia slides linked together by commands . As the main technical constraint that impacted Myst was slow CD @-@ ROM drive read speeds , Cyan had to go to great lengths to make sure all the game elements loaded as quickly as possible . Images were stored as 8 @-@ bit [UNK] resources with custom color palettes and QuickTime still image compression . Animated elements such as movies and object animations were encoded as QuickTime movies with [UNK] compression ; in total , there were more than 66 minutes of [UNK] animation . This careful processing made the finished graphics look like [UNK] images despite their low bit depth ; the stills were reduced in size from 500 kB to around 80 kB . ",0

2880," Du Bois was inspired to greater activism by the lynching of Sam Hose , which occurred near Atlanta in 1899 . Hose was tortured , burned and hung by a mob of two thousand whites . When walking through Atlanta to discuss the lynching with newspaper editor Joel Chandler Harris , Du Bois encountered Hose 's burned knuckles in a storefront display . The episode stunned Du Bois , and he resolved that "" one could not be a calm cool , and detached scientist while Negroes were lynched , murdered , and starved . "" Du Bois realized that "" the cure wasn 't simply telling people the truth , it was inducing them to act on the truth . "" ",1
2881," After training as a teacher at Bede College , Durham University , he was not called up for military service during World War II , because teaching was a reserved occupation .

2884," By no stretch of the imagination can the score of Giselle be called great music , but it cannot be denied that it is admirably suited to its purpose . It is danceable , and it has colour and mood attuned to the various dramatic situations ... As we listen today to these haunting melodies composed over a century ago , we quickly become conscious of their intense nostalgic quality , not unlike the opening of a Victorian Keepsake , between whose pages lies an admirably preserved Valentine — in all the glory of its intricate paper lace and symbolic floral designs — which whispers of a leisured age now forever past . For a brief space the air seems faintly perfumed with [UNK] violet and gardenia . The music of Giselle still exerts its magic . ",1
2885," Most , if not all , of the victims — Emma Elizabeth Smith , Martha Tabram , Mary Ann Nichols , Annie Chapman , Elizabeth Stride , Catherine Eddowes , Mary Jane Kelly , Rose Mylett , Alice McKenzie , Frances Coles , and an unidentified woman — were prostitutes . Smith was sexually assaulted and robbed by a gang . Tabram was stabbed 39 times . Nichols , Chapman , Stride , Eddowes , Kelly , McKenzie and Coles had their throats cut . Eddowes and Stride were killed on the same night , minutes and less than a mile apart ; their murders were nicknamed the "" double event "" , after a phrase in a postcard sent to the press by someone claiming to be the Ripper . The bodies of Nichols , Chapman , Eddowes and Kelly had abdominal mutilations . Mylett was strangled . The body of the unidentified woman was dismembered , but the exact cause of her death is unclear . ",0

2888," After the 1997 provincial election , Klein appointed Stelmach Minister of Agriculture , Food , and Rural development . While he held this office , his department encouraged the establishment of feedlots . The opposition parties charged that the government was not regulating these sufficiently , but Stelmach responded that municipalities had the authority necessary to effectively regulate them . On the Canadian Wheat Board controversy , Stelmach sided with farmers who wanted an end to the federal body 's monopoly on grain sales in the western provinces . [UNK] , Stelmach sponsored five bills while in the Agriculture , Food , and Rural Development portfolio , all of which passed through the legislature . 1997 's Meat Inspection Amendment Act required meat inspectors to acquire a search warrant before entering a private dwelling , but also allowed for fines to be voluntarily paid without requiring a court case . It was called by Liberal agriculture critic Ken Nicol "" a really good bill "" . The Livestock and Livestock Products Amendment Act of the same year eliminated government guarantee of the Livestock Patrons ' Assurance Fund , designed to protect cattle producers from payment defaults by livestock dealers , in favour of leaving the Fund entirely in the hands of the industry . It too was supported by the Liberals , with Nicol calling it "" very easy for us to accept "" . In 1998 , Stelmach sponsored the Agriculture Statutes ( Penalties ) Amendment Act , which overhauled the penalty system for violation of various agricultural statutes , setting maximum fines and leaving the precise amount up to judges on a case by case basis . It also passed with Liberal support , as MLA Ed Gibbons said that it "" really makes a lot of sense "" . Another 1998 bill was the Marketing of Agricultural Products Amendment Act , which allowed provincial agricultural marketing boards to revise their marketing plans , and was supported by the opposition . Finally , Stelmach initiated the Agriculture Statutes ( Livestock Identification ) Amendment Act , which allowed the government to delegate the inspection of branding to the cattle industry . The bill was the subject of considerable debate on second reading , but was ultimately supported by the Liberals on the third and final reading . ",1
2889," Both Clements and Wetherby endorsed Bert T. Combs to succeed Wetherby as governor . Wetherby had named Combs to the Kentucky Court of Appeals in 1951 to fill a vacancy created by the death of Judge Roy Helm . Happy Chandler , Clements ' old foe , ran against Combs in the primary and painted him as a pawn of "" Clementine "" and "" Wetherbine "" , his derogatory nicknames for Clements and Wetherby . In fact , Chandler ran the entire campaign not just against Combs , but against Clements and Wetherby as well . He charged both Clements and Wetherby with extravagant spending in their administrations . Among his allegations were that Clements had purchased a $ 20 @,@ 000 rug for his office and that Wetherby had paneled his office with African mahogany . Chandler promised that , if elected , he would use "" good , honest Kentucky wood "" in his office and that all Kentuckians would be invited to the capitol to walk on the $ 20 @,@ 000 rug . Ultimately , invoices showed that no $ 20 @,@ 000 rug had been purchased by Clements and Wetherby 's paneling had been purchased from and installed by a local contractor . Chandler 's charges may have been inaccurate , but he defeated Combs in the primary and went on to win the general election . ",0

2912," The [UNK] is a distinctive bones found lining the frills of ceratopsians . The name is a misnomer , as they are not associated with the occipital bone . [UNK] begin as separate bones that fuse during the animal 's growth to either the squamosal or parietal bones that make up the base of the frill . These bones were ornamental instead of functional , and may have helped differentiate species . [UNK] probably were present in all known ceratopsids with the possible exception of Zuniceratops . They appear to have been broadly different between short @-@ frilled ceratopsids ( centrosaurines ) and long @-@ frilled ceratopsids ( chasmosaurines ) , being elliptical with constricted bases in the former group , and triangular with wide bases in the latter group . Within these broad definitions , different species would have somewhat different shapes and numbers . In centrosaurines especially , like Centrosaurus , Pachyrhinosaurus , and Styracosaurus , these bones become long and [UNK] or hook @-@ like . A well @-@ known example is the coarse sawtooth fringe of broad triangular epoccipitals on the frill of Triceratops .

The project was an extremely costly one but was completed in 1897 , and football was first played on the Crabble site in the same year . In 1902 , the original owners of the site , beset by financial problems , contemplated selling the land for redevelopment but eventually sold the site to the town council for £ 5 @,@ 500 . The pitch was shared by the town 's cricket and football teams , with the cricketers being given priority , which meant that the football team was forced to begin and end its season either with a long run of consecutive away matches or by playing matches at other , less satisfactory , venues in the town . To resolve the issue , the council opted to lay out a new football pitch further up the hillside , behind the lower pitch 's pavilion .

2977," The most notable omissions from the team were Dan Carter , Richard Loe , and Reuben Thorne . Daniel Carter was omitted due to the strength of Andrew Mehrtens and Aaron Mauger who occupied the first and second five @-@ eighth positions respectively , and because he was regarded as "" the star of the next decade "" . Despite being considered one of Canterbury 's best ever props , Richard Loe missed out as he was only in the team for the unsuccessful 1996 season .

2982," Modes are numbered according to the number of half @-@ wavelengths in the vibration . Some modes exhibit vibrations in more than one direction ( such as drumhead mode which has two ) and consequently the mode number consists of more than one number . When the vibration is in one of the higher modes , there will be multiple nodes on the resonator where there is no motion . For some types of resonator , this can provide a convenient place to make a mechanical attachment for structural support . Wires attached at nodes will have no effect on the vibration of the resonator or the overall filter response . In figure 5 , some possible anchor points are shown as wires attached at the nodes . The modes shown are ( 5a ) the second longitudinal mode fixed at one end , ( 5b ) the first torsional mode , ( 5c ) the second torsional mode , ( 5d ) the second flexural mode , ( 5e ) first radial expansion mode and ( 5f ) first radially symmetric drumhead mode .

2983," P. fluviatile was formerly divided into three subspecies : P. f. [UNK] , P. f. [UNK] and P. f. fluviatile . The first two of these live in North Africa , and were later combined and separated from P. fluviatile as the species Potamon [UNK] . By 1983 , the nominate subspecies ( equivalent to the current circumscription of the species P. fluviatile ) had been divided into six [UNK] , or "" tribes "" . [UNK] fluviatilis was found in northern Italy , natio [UNK] in southern Italy , and [UNK] [UNK] , [UNK] and [UNK] were found in parts of Greece . The geographical distribution of natio [UNK] was not reported , and it was suggested that a further ( undescribed ) tribe inhabited the Greek island of Andros . Despite this wealth of infraspecific taxa , they are rarely used by scientists , and some have questioned directly the value of defining infraspecific taxa within P. fluviatile . In 1990 , the population on Malta was described as a separate subspecies , Potamon fluviatile [UNK] , and that taxon has become a conservation icon in Malta following its legal protection in 1993 , although not all scientists recognise the taxon .

2986," Upon arriving in England in June 1858 , Morphy promptly challenged Staunton to a match . At first , Staunton declined Morphy 's offer saying that the challenge came too late . Morphy did not give up negotiations and urging Staunton to play . In early July Staunton agreed provided he was given time to get back into practice on openings and endgames , and provided that he could manage all this without breaking the publication contract for his Shakespearean work . In early August , Morphy wrote asking Staunton when the match could occur , and Staunton asked again for a delay of some weeks . Staunton competed in a tournament that started in on 22 August in Birmingham , but this was a knock @-@ out tournament and he was eliminated in the second round by Johann Löwenthal , after playing a total of four games . This was to be Staunton 's last public chess competition . [UNK] Murray wrote that Staunton had overexerted himself and damaged his health by trying both to get ahead of schedule on the Shakespeare project and to play some competitive chess . Just before Staunton left London for Birmingham , his old enemy George Walker published an article accusing him of trying to delay the match indefinitely , and Staunton received another letter from Morphy pressing him to name a date for the match . Staunton and Morphy met socially in Birmingham and , after a tense discussion , Staunton agreed to play in early November . Just after the tournament a letter signed by "" Anti @-@ book "" appeared in Staunton 's column in the Illustrated London News , alleging that Morphy did not actually have the money for his share of the stakes . This letter is widely thought to have been written by Staunton himself ; if so , he must have written it immediately after reading Walker 's article and Morphy 's letter and immediately before leaving for Birmingham . Around this time Morphy wrote to friends in the US asking them to obtain the stake money for the Staunton match . Morphy 's family refused to contribute as they "" should not allow him to play a money match either with his own money or anyone else 's "" , but the New Orleans Chess Club sent £ 500 . Meanwhile , Morphy went to Paris to play against continental masters . In September the Illustrated London News printed both a complimentary full @-@ page article about Morphy and a complimentary mention of him in its chess column . On 6 October 1858 , while in Paris Morphy wrote Staunton an open letter which was also circulated to several publications , in which Morphy complained about Staunton 's conduct . Staunton replied on 9 October , re @-@ stating the difficulties he faced , but now giving them as reasons to cancel the match . On 23 October , Staunton published his entire reply along with a partial copy of Morphy 's open letter , omitting the reference to the "" Anti @-@ book "" letter . Various chess columns then printed anonymous and acrimonious letters . Morphy took no part in any of this , but wrote to Lord Lyttelton , the president of the British Chess Association , explaining his own efforts to bring about the match , accusing Staunton of avoiding the match by all means short of admitting he did not wish to play , complaining about Staunton 's representation of the facts in the Illustrated London News , and demanding "" that you shall declare to the world it is through no fault of mine that this match has not taken place . "" Lyttelton replied that it was reasonable for Staunton to decline the match , but that in his opinion Staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to America , but had instead often given the impression that he would soon be ready to start the match .

The two armies met at the village of [UNK] , northeast of Negroponte . The battle resulted in a major victory for Licario : John de la Roche was unhorsed and captured , while Giberto was either killed ( according to Sanudo ) or captured and taken along with de la Roche as a prisoner to Constantinople , where , according to Nikephoros Gregoras , the sight of the hated renegade , moving triumphantly among the assembled Byzantine court , caused him to drop dead .

2991," The report of the Commissioners was not binding , and the rivalry between supporters of the two routes intensified . An independent Glasgow , Dumfries and Carlisle Railway was proposed , to build from Carlisle to meet the GPK & AR , and the GPK & AR itself proposed several branches , mostly for tactical reasons , to weaken or exclude the Caledonian Railway ( CR ) , as the dominant supporter of the Annandale route . Of these only an extension from Kilmarnock to Horsecleugh , south of the mining town of Old Cumnock was authorised , by Act of 21 July 1845 . The CR case was strengthened by its intended branch to Edinburgh ; moreover locomotive designs were being improved , and the capacity to haul trains over the steep gradients of the Annandale route was diminishing in importance . In Parliamentary hearings in 1845 , the Caledonian Railway passed the Commons and despite the GPK & AR fighting on in the Lords , the Caledonian Railway was authorised , in preference to the Nithsdale route , on 31 July 1845 .

As a result , firms cannot pass on any part of the tax by raising prices , so they would be forced to pay all of it themselves . ",0

3144," Much of the album 's early American success is attributed to the efforts of Pink Floyd 's US record company , Capitol Records . Newly appointed chairman Bhaskar Menon set about trying to reverse the relatively poor sales of the band 's 1971 studio album Meddle . Meanwhile , disenchanted with Capitol , the band and manager O 'Rourke had been quietly negotiating a new contract with CBS president Clive Davis , on Columbia Records . The Dark Side of the Moon was the last album that Pink Floyd were obliged to release before formally signing a new contract . Menon 's enthusiasm for the new album was such that he began a huge promotional advertising campaign , which included radio @-@ friendly truncated versions of "" Us and Them "" and "" Time "" . In some countries – notably the UK – Pink Floyd had not released a single since 1968 's "" Point Me at the Sky "" , and unusually "" Money "" was released as a single on 7 May , with "" Any Colour You Like "" on the B @-@ side .

3149," In the early 1970s , the RAF issued an Air Staff Requirement for the development of a new interceptor intended to replace both the Phantom and the Lightning . One initial proposal was a plan introduced by McDonnell Douglas for a variable geometry wing Phantom . This was rejected by the RAF owing to the fact that there was little apparent improvement in performance over the existing Phantom , and that it might affect the development of the "" Multi @-@ Role Combat Aircraft "" ( MRCA ) . Another idea that the MRCA concept , which eventually evolved into the Panavia Tornado , could be used in the interceptor role , was ruled out , as both its avionics and engines were optimised for the low level interdictor mission . The UK 's partners in the MRCA project displayed no enthusiasm for the idea of developing an air defence version of the Tornado , so the UK alone began the process , with the authorisation for what came to be known as the Tornado ADV issued in March 1976 . With the aircraft in development , the initial plan was for the Tornado to replace the remaining two squadrons of Lightnings , as well as all seven squadrons of Phantoms . However , while the Tornado was in development , the RAF looked at interim measures to replace the Phantom , which had been in service for over a decade by 1980 , and was beginning to suffer from fatigue issues ; one proposal looked at was the possibility of leasing or purchasing a quantity of F @-@ 15 Eagles to re @-@ equip 19 and 92 Squadrons , the units stationed in Germany . Further suggestions were that up to 80 F @-@ 15s be procured , to replace the Phantom and Lightning squadrons then in service , or even cancel the Tornado entirely and purchase the F @-@ 15 with UK adaptations ( specifically to be fitted with the AI.24 Foxhunter radar developed for the Tornado , and capable of carrying the Skyflash air @-@ to @-@ air missile ) . Ultimately , the F @-@ 15 option was not seriously considered , as it was felt there would not be time or cost savings over this plan against the Tornado . Subsequent to this came a decision that the Tornado , once it had entered service , would only re @-@ equip three of the Phantom squadrons , with two retained in the UK and two in Germany . Eventually , the Tornado accounted for the two FG.1 squadrons at RAF Leuchars ( 43 and 111 Squadrons ) , plus two FGR.2 units ( 23 Squadron and 29 Squadron ) , with 56 and 74 Squadrons remaining with the Phantom .

3176," Spiders are chelicerates and therefore arthropods . As arthropods they have : segmented bodies with jointed limbs , all covered in a cuticle made of chitin and proteins ; heads that are composed of several segments that fuse during the development of the embryo . Being chelicerates , their bodies consist of two tagmata , sets of segments that serve similar functions : the foremost one , called the cephalothorax or prosoma , is a complete fusion of the segments that in an insect would form two separate tagmata , the head and thorax ; the rear tagma is called the abdomen or opisthosoma . In spiders , the cephalothorax and abdomen are connected by a small cylindrical section , the pedicel . The pattern of segment fusion that forms chelicerates ' heads is unique among arthropods , and what would normally be the first head segment disappears at an early stage of development , so that chelicerates lack the antennae typical of most arthropods . In fact , chelicerates ' only appendages ahead of the mouth are a pair of chelicerae , and they lack anything that would function directly as "" jaws "" . The first appendages behind the mouth are called pedipalps , and serve different functions within different groups of chelicerates . ",0

Adam and engineer John Stears overhauled the prototype of the Aston Martin DB5 coupe , installing these and other features into a car over six weeks . The scene where the DB5 crashes was filmed twice , with the second take being used in the film . The first take , in which the car drives through the fake wall , can be seen in the trailer .

3202," Compared with planets and other astronomical bodies , the objects of everyday life ( people , cars , houses , even mountains ) have little mass . Where such objects are concerned , the laws governing the behavior of test particles are sufficient to describe what happens . Notably , in order to deflect a test particle from its geodesic path , an external force must be applied . A chair someone is sitting on applies an external upwards force preventing the person from falling freely towards the center of the Earth and thus following a geodesic , which they would otherwise be doing without matter in between them and the center of the Earth . In this way , general relativity explains the daily experience of gravity on the surface of the Earth not as the downwards pull of a gravitational force , but as the upwards push of external forces . These forces deflect all bodies resting on the Earth 's surface from the geodesics they would otherwise follow . For matter objects whose own gravitational influence cannot be neglected , the laws of motion are somewhat more complicated than for test particles , although it remains true that spacetime tells matter how to move .

3265," Based on the rules of botanical nomenclature , the oldest properly published name for a species has priority over newer names . Bartram applied the Linnaean binomial Palma elata to a "" large , solitary palm with an ashen white trunk topped by a green leaf sheath [ the [UNK] ] and pinnate leaves "" growing in central Florida . While no type collection is known , there are no other native palms that would fit Bartram 's description . In 1946 Francis Harper pointed out that Bartram 's name was valid and proposed a new combination , Roystonea elata . Liberty Hyde Bailey 's use of the name in his 1949 revision of the genus , established its usage . ",1

3267," The situation of people who were half or quarter Jews , and of Jews who were married to non @-@ Jews , was more complex . Under the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 , their status had been left deliberately ambiguous . Heydrich announced that Mischlings ( a Nazi pejorative for mixed @-@ race persons ) of the first degree ( persons with two Jewish grandparents ) would be treated as Jews . This would not apply if they were married to a non @-@ Jew and had children by that marriage . It would also not apply if they had been granted written exemption by "" the highest offices of the Party and State . "" Such persons would be sterilised or deported if they refused sterilisation . "" Mischlings of the second degree "" ( persons with one Jewish grandparent ) would be treated as Germans unless they were married to Jews or Mischlings of the first degree , had a "" racially especially undesirable appearance that marks him outwardly as a Jew "" , or had a "" political record that shows that he feels and behaves like a Jew "" . Persons in these latter categories would be killed even if married to non @-@ Jews . In the case of mixed marriages , Heydrich recommended that each case should be evaluated individually and the impact on any German relatives assessed . If such a marriage had produced children who were being raised as Germans , the Jewish partner would not be killed . If they were being raised as Jews , they might be killed or sent to an old @-@ age ghetto . These exemptions applied only to German and Austrian Jews , and were not always observed even for them . In most of the occupied countries , Jews were rounded up and killed en masse , and anyone who lived in or identified with the Jewish community in any given place was regarded as a Jew . ",0
3268," Doby hit 20 home runs and 69 RBIs in 1951 , both fewer than last season , and his batting average improved to .295 . His 21 @-@ game hit @-@ streak was the second @-@ longest for the Indians that season , behind Dale Mitchell 's mark of 23 games in a row . Indians general manager Hank Greenberg reduced Doby 's salary due to the lower home run numbers despite Doby , who attributed the lower numbers to tightness in his legs , stating he would not accept a pay cut . Indians manager Al López confirmed that Doby was injury @-@ riddled throughout the season , stating that he "" was beset by first one injury and then another "" including "" a muscle tear in his thigh , a groin pull , an ankle twist .

"" Cobbledick also took issue with Doby 's assertion that opposing pitchers were knocking him down due to Doby being black . The assertion was confirmed by Sam Lacy , who wrote in the Baltimore Afro @-@ American , "" Statistics show that eight colored players in the two major leagues were hit by pitches a total of 68 times during the 1951 campaign , an average of 8 1 ⁄ 2 times per man .

3270," The War Bond Drives were viewed as key in boosting national morale by giving citizens the opportunity to support the war effort . They boosted patriotism and were a good marketing device for drumming up support . In fact , not only did celebrities help promote the bonds for free , but also , most air time and advertising space for the bonds was donated . The first War Loan Drive , known as "" The Victory Loan Drive "" , began in early 1942 .

The song requires a great deal of legato to keep "" the tunes softness and sweetness , without resorting to volume . "" Carey 's vocals on the track are defined as "" soft and controlled , "" managing to maintain the delicate balance in a manner that seems effortless , floating easily over the keyboard and the shimmer of the guitar . Lyrically , due to the song 's message of "" commitment and promise , "" and the "" tinkling music @-@ box line played on the synthesizer , "" the track gives the sensation of a wedding vow recital . "" Never Forget You "" is a slow song , further connecting it to the song 's message of "" lamenting the loss of love , in a very tender way . "" The song contains keyboard notes that hover over the verses and allow Carey to indulge in her backing vocals . It was described by Nickson as a "" stand out track , "" one that could have easily become a hit single , "" with an appeal that would have easily transcended generational barriers . "" ",1

3275," Many protein @-@ coding genes have more than one polyadenylation site , so a gene can code for several mRNAs that differ in their 3 ' end . Since alternative polyadenylation changes the length of the 3 ' untranslated region , it can change which binding sites for microRNAs the 3 ' untranslated region contains . MicroRNAs tend to repress translation and promote degradation of the mRNAs they bind to , although there are examples of microRNAs that stabilise transcripts . Alternative polyadenylation can also shorten the coding region , thus making the mRNA code for a different protein , but this is much less common than just shortening the 3 ' untranslated region .

3282," Trotter never played a significant role in the NAACP , and in its early years actively competed with it . In 1911 Trotter 's group and the NAACP both held rallies in Boston to mark the centennial of abolitionist Charles Sumner 's birth . Trotter was peripherally involved with the NAACP for a few years , but he did not approve of the amount of white involvement in the interracial group . His feud with Du Bois ran deep , so he rarely contributed to the organization at the national level . He was also troubled by the attitudes expressed in the Boston chapter , which he told NAACP leader Joel Spingarn needed more "" radical , courageous activity .

The plan 's German code was [UNK] N ° 1 , Fall Gelb , or "" Deployment Instruction No. 1 , Case Yellow "" . The operation was a limited operation in which Luxembourg and the Low Countries were to be conquered in order to provide a base for further operations against France at a later date and amounted to a less ambitious re @-@ run of the infamous Schlieffen Plan which failed during the First World War in 1914 . It was rejected by Adolf Hitler and at the turn of the year , Heinz Guderian 's chief of staff , Erich von Manstein secured Hitler 's attention with a modified version .

3292," Another factor was that , in early May 1944 , an uncontrolled agent based in Spain ( who sold fictional intelligence to the Germans ) had passed on details of a meeting in Gibraltar between several high @-@ ranking Allied officers . Documents found after the war indicate that the Germans found this information suspect , and may have treated Montgomery 's appearance as equally so .

3394," Reflections on the race by the organisers and the media generally concluded that the Grand Prix had been a poor replacement for the Gordon Bennett races .

3452," During and after Caracalla 's reign the position of the Senate had been considerably weakened . The balance of power had been transferred from the Senate to the army ; as such the emperor of Rome was decided by the soldier while the Senate existed solely to officiate state affairs without any real authority . Thus , both Macrinus and later Elagabalus would attempt to secure the favour of the military while generally disregarding the opinion of the Senate .

3758," It was reported during a study by David P. Barash that when hunting Olympic marmots as prey , coyotes and cougars approach the marmot within about 15 m ( 49 ft ) , advance to an alpine fir close to the victim , and then chase the marmot downhill to its colony . If the marmot is able to flee into a burrow and sound an alarm call , other marmots will scurry to their burrows for safety . But the predator does not stop here ; it is usually persistent and will scratch outside the entrance to try to dig out its prey . Minutes later , when a marmot from a nearby burrow peers out to see if the predator has gone , it will sometimes sound another alarm call , which summons the predator to its burrow . It dives back underground and the predator usually remains frustrated as these alarm calls continue and force it to run around from burrow to burrow , getting tired and aggravated , and finally giving up .

By 1397 both of his sons had died , he was in his late fifties , and he had begun to think of his tomb , finally deciding to build a new "" Sainte Chapelle "" in his capital of Bourges to house it . His collection of relics included objects claimed to be the wedding ring of the Virgin Mary , a cup used at the Wedding at Cana , a piece of the Burning Bush and many others . However the provenance of the Holy Thorn , as well as its centrality to the Passion of Christ must have given it a special status . The crown from which the thorn came had been bought in 1239 by Louis IX , both a saint and King of France , from the Latin Emperor in Constantinople , Baldwin II , along with a portion of the True Cross . Both had been in Constantinople since the Muslim Conquest of the Holy Land in the 7th century , and may very well be the same relics that Bishop Paulinus of Nola saw in Jerusalem in 409 . There are a number of other thorn relics said to have come from the relic in the Paris Sainte Chapelle , including the far smaller Salting Reliquary in the British Museum , a French pendant of about 1340 .

In extreme eastern Pennsylvania , it is 240 m ( 790 ft ) thick , thinning to the west , becoming only 15 m ( 49 ft ) thick along the Ohio River , and only a few feet in Licking County , Ohio . The thinning , or stratigraphic convergence , from east to west is caused by decreasing grain size in the clastic deposits , which entered the basin from the east . The beds finally "" pinch out "" westward because deposition was limited by the Cincinnati Arch , the bulge that formed the west shore of the basin . Where the formation is relatively thick , it is divided into several members , and as the formation continues to thicken to the east , these members are further divided . Some workers chose to classify the Marcellus as a subgroup , and classify some of the members as separate formations . ",0

3857," Between 1797 and 1809 the First French Empire gradually occupied the entire eastern Adriatic coastline and a substantial part of its hinterland , ending the Venetian and the Ragusan republics , establishing the Illyrian Provinces . In response the Royal Navy started the blockade of the Adriatic Sea leading to the Battle of Vis in 1811 . The Illyrian Provinces were captured by the Austrians in 1813 , and absorbed by the Austrian Empire following the Congress of Vienna in 1815 . This led to formation of the Kingdom of Dalmatia and restoration of the Croatian Littoral to the Kingdom of Croatia , now both under the same crown . The 1830s and 1840s saw romantic nationalism inspire the Croatian National Revival , a political and cultural campaign advocating the unity of all South Slavs in the empire . Its primary focus was the establishment of a standard language as a counterweight to Hungarian , along with the promotion of Croatian literature and culture . During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 Croatia sided with the Austrians , Ban Josip Jelačić helping defeat the Hungarian forces in 1849 , and ushering a period of Germanization policy . ",1

Elsewhere in the field , Berger passed Brundle , and Montermini moved ahead of Diniz . At the front of the pack , Hill was in control , extending his lead over Alesi to 6 @.@ 2 seconds by lap 5 and to 12 seconds by lap 12 . For his part , Schumacher was being held up by Alesi , the two cars running in formation in the early stages of the race .

It carried the Axholme Joint Railway over the canal , and consisted of four arches built from bricks , with a central swinging section , to allow keels to sail along the canal . The bridge was retained after the railway was closed in 1966 , because stators from Keadby Power Station were too heavy to be transported over the A161 road bridge . The stators were carried by road to Ealand , loaded onto the railway , and crossed the bridge to Belton , where they were transferred back to a road vehicle .

3915," The episode featured Mel Gibson as a guest voice . Scully had previously met him while writing jokes for a school fundraiser along with his wife Julie Thacker . Gibson and Daniel Stern were the hosts and needed jokes for the event . It turned out that Gibson was a fan of the show and watched it with his children . With that knowledge , it did not take Scully long to invite him to do a part . Gibson was willing to do the job and even came in on three separate occasions to do retakes – mostly because he knew his children would be watching . Unlike most guest voices , Gibson recorded the show along with the cast . On one occasion , it turned out that a joke written for Gibson actually did happen in real life . The writing staff wanted Gibson to say that he would urinate behind a dumpster , because it sounded like it would not be a classy thing to do for a movie star . He had , however , already done that during a couple of film premieres because he can feel trapped in a public toilet with a lot of fans . Gibson was surprised the writers knew about the story , but it turned out to be a coincidence . Otherwise , the episode frequently references films Gibson appeared in . After the studio cart crashes , Gibson says to Homer , "" I 'm getting too old for this crap , "" a reference to a line said by Danny Glover 's character Roger Murtaugh to Gibson 's character Martin Riggs in the Lethal Weapon film series . A poster for his film Braveheart is on the wall in the editing room and the Road Warrior car from the 1981 film Mad Max 2 is also featured .

On the top of the spinae stood small tables or frames supported on pillars , and also small pieces of marble in the shape of eggs or dolphins . The spina eventually became very elaborate , with statues and obelisks and other forms of art , but the multiplication of the adornments of the spina had one unfortunate result : They became so numerous that they obstructed the view of spectators on lower seats .
